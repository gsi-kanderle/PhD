\section{Radiotherapy}

Since the discovery of X-rays in 1895 the radiation has been used by physicans for treating patients. 
In the begining only superfical diseases could be cured, but as time and technology progressed X-ray tubes gained on voltage
and allowing treatment of deeper suited tumors.

The radiation from linear accelerator was first used in medicine in 1953. Because the beam is more collimated and energies are
higher than X-ray tube the cure rates improved tremendously. The next big milestone was introduction of computeres in the field
of radiotherapy. This led to better diagnostic tools, such as computed tomography scans (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
positron emission tomography (PET). With those tools the location of the tumor could be much better estimated and hence the physicans
could easier prescribe treatment. The potential of computers were afterwards exploited also in treatment planning with intensity modulated
radiation therapy (IMRT) which, together with diagnostic tools, provides an exact dose shaping in accordance to patient specific tumors.

In 1946 it was discovered that protons could be used alongside photons for cancer treatment. Furthermore it was shown that protons have preferable depth dose profile 
compared to photons. First patient treatment soon followed in the early 1950's at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, USA. Heavier ions, such as 
He$^{2+}$, $^{20}$Ne and $^6$C were also used later on for treatment. In the begining only passive beam delivery was used for treatment 
and in the 1990's active beam solutions were developed at Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI), Villigen (Switzerland) for protons and at GSI, Darmstadt 
(Germany) for carbon ions.

Both treatment modalities (photons and ions) use the same principle to eliminate cancer cells. The physical and biological mechanism behind 
it will be explained in detail in the following sections.


\section{Physcial and biological basics of radiotherapy}

\subsection{Interaction of radiation with matter}

The interactions between photons and ions with matter are quite different, as can be seen from depth dose distributions in Figure \ref{ddp}.  Photons deposit highest local dose shortly after entering the matter 
(at the energies used in radiotherapy). Ions deposit most of their dose right before they stop in the Bragg Peak region. The position of the Bragg Peak depends on the energy of the ions, which is exploited in the treatment
of deep suited tumors.

Ions deposit most of the dose at the end of the particle track, the Bragg peak. Figure taken from \cite{Schardt2010} }
\label{ddp}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dose definition}

Physicis in radiotherapy revolves around dose, $D$, which is defined as the ratio of the absorbed energy $dE$ per mass element $dm$ \cite{ICRU1993}:

\begin{equation}
 D = \frac{dE}{dm} \quad \left[ Gy = \frac{J}{kg} \right]
\end{equation}

Usually we can describe energy loss of a beam in a thin layer of material, $dE/dx$. Dose can be then rewritten as:

\begin{equation}
 D = \frac{dE}{dx} \times \frac{1}{F} \times \frac{1}{\rho}
\end{equation}

where $F$ is fluence and $\rho$ the material denisty.



\subsubsection{Interaction of photons with matter}

Photons mostly interact with matter in one of the following ways: coherent or Rayleigh scattering, photoelectric effect, Compton scattering and pair production. The cross section, $\sigma$, for each of these processes depends
as well on the energy of the indicent photons as on the atomic number of the absorbin material \cite{Lilley2006}. The decreasing photon intesity in matter, $I$, can be described as:


\begin{equation}
 I = I_{0} \cdot e^{- N \sigma x} = I_{0} \cdot e^{-\mu x}
 \label{expdecrease}
\end{equation} 

where $I_{0}$ stands for the initial intensity of the photons, $x$ the depth of the material in units of length, $N$ the atomic density of the material and $\mu$ is the attenuation coefficient. The cross section, $sigma$ is the sum of all
possibile Interaction processes.

\begin{equation}
{\sigma} = \sigma_{rayleigh} + \sigma_{photoelectric} + Z\sigma_{compton} + \sigma_{pairproduction} 
\end{equation}

The energy range of photons used in radiotherapy is between 100 keV and 25 MeV. The dominating process in this energy range is Compton scattering \cite{Alpen1998}.
The electrons resulting from Compton interaction scatter mostly in a forward direction. Therefore a maximum of the depth-dose profile occurs when electrons stop at a certain depth, 
the mean electron range. After this build up the dose deposition decreases exponentially (see Figure \ref{ddp} and Equation \ref{expdecrease}).


\subsubsection{Interaction of ions with matter}
\label{iion}
Ions can interact with matter either with elastic columb scattering from target nuclei (nuclear stopping) or with inelastic collision with target electorns (electronic stopping).
At the ion energies used in radiotherapy, which are less then 500$\mathrm{MeV}/\mathrm{u}$, the electronic stoping is the dominated interaction. This results in ionization and excitation of the atoms in target.

The mean rate of ions energy loss in matter is described by the Bethe-Bloch formula \cite{Bethe1930, Bloch1933}. Since we are interested in low ion energies, we can make the following approximation:

\begin{equation}
- \left \langle \frac{dE}{dx} \right \rangle = \frac{ 4 \pi N_{e} z_{eff}^{2} }{ m_{e} v^{2} } \left( \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}} \right) ^{2} \left[ln \left( \frac{2m_{e}v^{2}}{I} \right)+correction \right]
 \label{bethe}
\end{equation}

here $N_{e}$ is the materials electron density, $e$ and $m_{e}$ are the charge and mass 
of an electron, $\epsilon_{0}$ the electrical field constant and $I$ the mean excitation energy of the absorber material. 
Barkas formula \cite{Barkas1963} can be used for the approximation of the effective projectile charge $z_{eff}$: 

% \vspace*{-0.8cm}
\begin{equation}
 z_{eff} = z \left( 1 - e^{-125 \beta z^{\frac{2}{3}}} \right)
\end{equation}

where $\beta$ is the projectile speed in units of $c$.

The energy loss of ions is proportional to $z_{eff}$ and inversely proportional to $v^2$. The shape of the curve in Figure \ref{ddp} can now be understood. Ions enter the matter with a high velocity,
resulting in a small energy deposition. Their velocity gradualy decreases, which in turn increases the energy deposition. The maximum of the energy loss is called Bragg peak or particle range.

\subsubsection{Lateral scattering and range straggling of ions}
\label{scat}
As mentioned in section \ref{iion} ions interact mostly via electronic stopping at energies used in radiotherapy. However, nuclear stopping still occurs and it is the main reason for lateral scattering.
The angular spread of ions is dependent on the mass of the target nuclei and on the momentum of the indecient ions \cite{Moliere1948}. The lateral scattering is proportional to mass of the target nuclei and inversely proportional
on the momentum of indecient ions. Carbon ions have thus less lateral scatter then protons. Experiments have shown that carbon ions have three times smaller angular spread compared to protons at the same range in water 
(15.6 cm, 150 MeV/u protons and 285 MeV/u $^{12}$C ions) \cite{Schardt2010}.

Statistical fluctuations of specific electronic stopping events cause range straggling of ions. If the number of collisions is high or the material is thick enoguh these fluctuations can be approximated by
a Gaussian probability distribution \cite{Bohr1940, Ahlen1980}. The straggling width $\sigma_R$ is proportional to:

\begin{equation}
 \sigma_R \propto R/\sqrt{M}
\end{equation}

where $R$ is the mean range of ions and $M$ the ion mass. Thus, the heavier the ion is, the less range straggling it has. Carbon ions have 3.5 smaller range straggling when compared to protons \cite{Schardt2010}.

\subsubsection{Nuclear fragmentation}
\label{nuclfrag}

When transversing through matter ions (except protons) can be fragmented into ions with lower Z. The lower Z fragments travel in the same direction as projectile ions and 
have a significant contribution to the dose deposited (see Figure \ref{iondd}). It is essential that this fragments are included in the treatment planning, so that the accurate dose can be assesed.

After colliding with target projectile fragments enter in a excited state. De-excitation occurs through
emisson of nucleons, nucleon clusters and photons. Two of the possible fragments of projectile $^{12}$C ions are isotopes $^{11}C$ and $^{10}C$, which are both $\beta^+$ emmiters \cite{Kraft2000}.
The resulting positron is annihilated with electrons in matter, resulting in two photons traveling in opposite direction. This can be used in PET (Positron Emission Tomography) without exposing patient
to additional radiation.. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{./Images/iondepthdosesum.png}
\caption{Impact of fragmantation on a depth dose distribution of carbon ions. Main contribution to the overall deposited dose (black line) comes from the primary ions (red line). The produced fragments 
(blue line) have a smaller impact, but non-negleigble especially in the dose tail behind the Bragg peak. Figure taken from \cite{Groezinger2004}}
\label{iondd}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Secondary electrons and track structure}

As mentioned in section \ref{iion} ions used in radiotherapy lose most of their energy via inelastic Coulumb scattering on target electrons. Such electrons can be libirated from target atoms and are called
secondary electrons, also $\delta$-electrons. $\delta$-electrons also travel throguh matter, further scattering and may even cause secondary ionization of the target atoms. When $\delta$-electrons energies are larger than $>$50 eV,
ionization becomes dominant process, which produces a large number of additional electrons \cite{Kraft2000,Schardt2010}.

The radial dose profile and track diameter is defined by the energy spectrum of the $\delta$-electrons. Most of the $\delta$-electorns are concentrated around the projectile ions path, since they receive small energy transfers 
or are scattered in the direction of indicent ions. Different models \cite{!!}, Monte Carlo simulations \cite{!!} predict radial dose fall-off approximatelly with $1/r^2$ for radial distances $r$. Varma et. al. have confirmed 
this experimentaly \cite{Varma1977}. The maximum radial distance $r_{max}$ is defined by the most energetic $\delta$-electrons, which are related to energy, $E$, of the projectile ions \cite{Kiefer1986}.

\begin{equation}
 r_{max} = E^{1.7}
\end{equation}

Following equation \ref{bethe}, $E$ is corelated to $Z^2$ and $1/\beta^2$, which means track structure is highly dependent on the projectile ion species and energy. This is well demonstrated on Figure \ref{track}:
Carbon ions have much more dense ionization structure compared to protons \cite{!!}. $\delta$-electrons have low energies, and thus the $r$ is on nanometer scale. As the energy of projectile ions decreases, their
stopping power increases and causes significantly larger number of $\delta$-electorns. The energy deposited by $\delta$-electrons in medium is described using the Linear Energy Transfer (LET), which is closely related to 
$dE/dx$. Fast ions, with little ionization, have thus small LET, while slow ions, with large ionization, have a high LET.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Radiobiology}

The aim of radiotherapy is to kill tumor cells and prevent furhter growth, while sparring healthy tissue. Ionizing radiation (photons and ions) causes damage throughout the cell. However the most susceptible part to radiation is the
carrier of genetic information, the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), located in the cell nucleus \cite{Munro1970}. Radiation can destroy DNA in two ways - directly or inderectly. Ionization and consequent destruction of DNA molecular bonds
via radiation is a direct effect (see Figure \ref{ida}b) and is typical for high-LET radiation. On the other hand, an indirect effect is when radiation hydrolyses water around DNA and produce highly reactive hydroxyl-radicals, OH 
(see Figure \ref{ida}a). Eventhough their lifetime is short, it's enough to cause severe damage to DNA. The formation of OH is typical for low-LET radiation, like photons. The two processes, direct and inderect, are not 
excluding and can damage DNA in parallel.

Damage to DNA can result in either single strand breaks (SSB) or double strand breaks (DSB) as  shown in Figure \ref{ida}b). When one of the double strands in the DNA helix is destroyed (SSB), it can be usually easily repaired by cell 
repair-mechanisms, since the complementary base is intact. If bases on both stands are destroyed (DSB) the DNA damage is much more complex and can lead to the breakage of the chromatin. The cell repair-mechanisms can handle DSB as well, 
albeit not that efficient as SSB. However if there are clustered DSBs, the damage is usually too severe for repair-mechanisms to undo it. The changes in damaged DNA can lead to carcinogenesis or cell death. The aim of radiotherapy is to 
cause apoptosis - a controlled self-inactivation of the cell due to DNA damage. Beside apoptosis, there is necrosis, an uncontrolled cell death. Cell necrosis often cause response from the immune system, leading to inflammation, which
radiotherapy tends to avoid.

\caption{Types of DNA damage caused by radiadtion. (a) Indirect damage occurs, when radiation forms free radicals hydroxyl radicals (OH), which can damage DNA. (b) Direct effects of radiation can cause single or double-strand breaks.

\label{ida}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Relative Biological Effectiveness}

Figure \ref{track} shows the size of DNA molecule in comparison with proton and carbon ion distribution of $\delta$-electrons around their track. Clustered DSB occur around ions Bragg peak due to the large ionization denseties. As mentioned
this poses a too large of a dificulty for cell repair-mechanisms, leading to cell death. The large ionization density is typical for ions and is one of the main advantages over photons in radiotherapeutic sense. Since most of the research about
cell response to radiadtion was done for photons, the biological effect of ions is usually described relative to a reference photon response. Relative biological effectiveness (RBE) is therefore defined as the ratio of the reference 
photon dose to the dose level of a specific ion radiation at the same biological effect (isoeffect):

\begin{equation}
 RBE = \left.\frac{D^{ref}_{photon}}{D_{ion}} \right|_{isoeffect}
\end{equation}

It is important to note at this point that RBE values are valid only for the same effect, the same biological endpoint and the same reference radiation. The most interesting biological endpoint in radiotherapy is cell survival and
side effects. RBE values are usually obtained from the cell survival curves (see Fig. ??). Cell survival curves, S, are commonly described by an exponential linear-quadratic model:

\begin{equation}
 S(D) = exp(-\alpha D - \beta D^2)
 \label{lq}
\end{equation}

characteristic of a tissue (cell) type is written in the $\alpha / \beta$ ratio, namely the tissue capacity to repair radiation damage. A small $\alpha / \beta$ ratio means cell is radioresistive (high repair capacity) and vice versa.
As seen in Figure \ref{dosedep} and Eq. \ref{lq} RBE values are dependent on dose level. Hence in ion radiotherapy, beside the physical absorbed dose, a photo-equivalent or biological dose incorporating the RBE also plays an important role. 
The unit for biological dose is Gy (RBE) \cite{ICRU2007}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{./Images/dose_dependence.pdf}
\caption{Typical cell survival curve for photons (black solid line) and heavy ions (red dashed line). Photon line shows typical shouldered form, described by linear-quadratic model.
Heavy ions show a much steeper decrease with dose. The RBE value can be calculated by looking at the points at the same survival value - same biological effect. Figure taken from \cite{Schardt2010}}
\label{dosedep}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Beside dose level, RBE among other depends also on the LET, the particle species and the tissue type \cite{Kraft2000}. Therefore RBE modeling is a very complex issue.
At GSI RBE is calculated using \textit{local effect model} (LEM) developed by Scholz et al \cite{Scholz1994}. The main assumption in LEM model is that biological 
effects are independent on the radiation type. The difference between different radiation types comes from the dose deposition in a small volume in the cell nucleus.
At the same total dose, photons have a homogeneous dose distribution over a cell nucleus, while ions have a highly localized dose distribution (around ion track).
Next assumption of the LEM is that the photon response is the same at these high local doses. With this assumption ion dose response can be predicted, by comparing
photon response at the high local dose level. LEM has received several revisions \cite{Elsaesser2006, Elsaesser2007, Elsaesser2009} and experimental verifications
\cite{Mitaroff1998, Kraemer2000a, Kraemer2003}, making it valid for clinical use. RBE for carbon ions ranges from 1 in the entrance channel, to a value around 5 at 
the Bragg peak \cite{Kraft2000}. The highest RBE for carbon ions is right around Bragg peak, which gives carbon ions a great advantage, since there is an increased 
biological effectiveness at target tissue compared to the normal tissue in the entrance channel. In proton therapy a constant RBE value of 1.1 across the treatment field
is used \cite{Paganetti2002}.


\subsection{Application technique}

Introduction

\subsubsection{Photon therapy}


\subsubsection{Ion therapy}

In order to ion therapy be successful, ions must be accelerated to appropriate energies (several hunderd MeV/u), the beam must be transported to target area and guided
onto the target with neccessary accuracy (around 1 mm). This requires very complex delivery systems and is one of the reason ion therapy is not as common as photon one.

Two types of particle accelerators are used in ion therapy - cyclotrons and synchrotrons. \textbf{Cyclotrons} can be built in a compact design and offer a continuous beam with
stable intensities. Particle energy, however, can not be regulated and therefore passive energy degraders are needed. Active energy variation is possible with \textbf{synchrotrons}, where a linear
accelerator is used to inject ions into the synchrotron and then the beam is regulated with ion optics. Synchrotrons are used in all heavy ion therapy centers, while cyclotrons are most
commonly used in proton therapy.

Each tumor has a unique shape, shize and position in patient. Therefore a single Bragg peak would not provide adequate dose and a beam shaping has to be employed. Two beam shaping systems
can be used - passive and active beam shaping. In the next two sections both will be explained, with focus on active beam shaping, which was used later in simulations.


\subsubsection{Passive beam shaping}

The general idea of passive beam shaping is to transform a beam into the shape of the tumor. This is done in several steps as schematically shown in Fig. \ref{passive}. Firstly, the beam is broadened using a scattering device (passive double scattering systems or magnetic wobbler)
 in order to obtain a broad, flat profile. In the next step, the beam is spread out over the required energy range with a range modulator. Usually range modulator are a rotating wheels of various thickness or a ridge filter \cite{Chu1993}.
 A single Bragg Peak is thus spread out into so-called \textit{spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP)}, which is moved to the required depth using a range shifter. The final two devices in beam's path are built for each patient individually. Collimator
 shapes beam in a lateral direction, while compensator adjusts SOBP to the distal edge of the tumor. However, compensator cannot adjust dose in the proximal edge of the tumor, resulting in an access dose to the healthy tissue (hatched area in
 Fig. \ref{passive}).
 
 Passive beam shaping offers more robust and faster treatment delivery in contrast to active beam shaping. However, it lacks tumor conformity, dose cannot be modulated and each patient needs individually tailored devices for each beam used in treatment.
 Furthermore beam travels through some material, exposing patient to additional dose due to fragmantation.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{./Images/deliverypassive.png}
\caption{Schematic presentation of a passive beam shaping. A scattering system is used to broaden the beam. afterwards a range modulator spreads out Bragg Peak to the required energy range.
The spread out Bragg peak is then shifted to a fixed range with a range modulator. Finally patient specific collimator and conformator serve for lateral and longitudinal conformity, respectively.
The proximal edge of the tumor cannot be shaped, as shown with hatched area. Figure taken from \cite{Sch10}.}
\label{passive}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Acitve beam shaping}

In contrast to passive beam shaping, active beam shaping works by dividing tumor into small points, which are then irradiated using a thin pencil beam. Tumor is first segmented into iso-energy slices (IES) and each of IES
is then covered with 2 dimensional grid. A thin pencil beam travels from point to point on this grid, irradiating each point with designated dose. This technique allows irradiation of arbitrary shape, without introducing additional, patient specific 
hardware. The lack of additional material in front of the patient also means less dose due to lesser neutron flux. Furthermore with the option to modulate dose in each point, dose in tumor is very conformal with less dose to healthy tissue.

There are differences in specifics of active beam shaping, so the GSI system of three-dimensional scanning system will be presented here \cite{Haberer1993,Kraft2000,Schardt2010} and a schematic presentation in Fig. \ref{scanning} and Fig. \ref{active}.
Synchrotron provides a thin pencil beam of $^{12}$C ions with selected energy. The energy defines the position of the Bragg peak in depth. Fig. \ref{active}b shows how are Bragg peaks stacked in depth to cover longitudinal extension of the tumor.
IES is covered with 2 dimensional grid of target points (raster points). The thin pencil beam travels continuously over raster points. It is guided by two magnetic deflection units. In treatment planing each raster point is designated a specific dose. 
During treatment the beam stays on each raster point until intensity monitoring system measures the designated dose. Then it moves to the next raster point. When the whole IES is irradiated, the treatment halts until next beam energy for next IES comes
from accelerator.

Fig. \ref{active}a displays how dose homogeneity in target is achieved. In typical configuration beam's full width half maximum is three times the lateral raster spacing. Such configuration offers robustness for uncertainties of the beam spots.
There also should be enough overlap between individual Bragg peaks. However, there should not be too many of IES, since the changing of the beam energy takes most of the time and hence prolongs the treatment. So instead of using high number of
 IES, Bragg peaks are broadened in longitudinal direction by using ripple filter (RiFi) - device similar to ridge filters used in passive beam shaping.

\subsection{Motion in radiotherapy}

Introduction


\subsubsection{Motion types}

Motion types, is's extent and origin is a vast topic. A brief introduction will be given here, for an in-depth explanation reader is pointed to review by Langen and Jones \cite{Langen2001}.
There are three main types of motion: patient positioning, inter- and intra-fractional motion. All three motion types are shown in Fig. \ref{motion}.
\newline
\textbf{Patient motion} is difference in patient position between image acquisition (e.g. CT) used for treatment planning and actual delivery. Patient motion introduces changes in tumor shape and tumor position. To overcome patient 
position uncertainties, patient immobilization and dedicated protocols are used.
\newline
\textbf{Interfractional motion} happens between two treatment sessions (fractions) and results in anatomical changes in a patient. It has a time scale of hours and days. For lung cancer patients, tumor shrinkage and lung density change occur between fractions MORI2009. 
Also changes in breathing pattern can impact treatment delivery. While the breathing motion trajectory has a good reproducibilty, the tumor baseline drifts significantly \cite{Sonke2008}. Repeted imaging and replanning reduces the impact of the interfractional motion.
\newline
\textbf{Intrafractional motion} usually stands for respiration and heart beat. It has a time scale from seconds to minutes. In this thesis we will focus on respiratory motion. Respiratory motion varies from patient to patient and 
it is responsible for tumor motion from a mm range to a couple of cm. Tumor size and T-staging are also corraleted to tumor motion \cite{Liu2007}. The respiratory-induced motion is largest in superior-inferior (SI) direction rather than 
in the anterior-posterior (AP) or left-right (LR) directions.


\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.43]{./Images/motion_examples.png}
\caption{Examples of the three major motion categories. On the left side (a) a lung tumor is displayed, which moves due to the respiration 
of the patient (intrafractional motion). Interfractional position changes are examplary shown in the middle (b), where two CT scans of a 
prostate patient are compared. Density variations between two CT scans are shown in (c). Figure taken from \cite{Eng11}}
\label{motion}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Motion mitigation techniques}


While all three motion types have to be addressed in treatment planning, special focus will be given on the intrafractional motion mitigation. Photon radiotherapy or particle radiotherapy with passive beam shaping 
use larger saftey margins to encompas the whole tumor motion as explained in section \ref{treatmentPlanning}. However, larger saftey margins are not enough to mitiage motion when active beam shaping is used. The beam delivery 
sequence and target motion interfere with one another, resulting in over- and underdosages in patients. Effect is called interplay and it has been thouroughly reviewed elsewhere \cite{Phillips1992,Bert2008}. The effect of interplay depends
on many factors, such as motion amplitude, beam direction, starting breathing phase etc. Three main techniques are currently established as mitigation to interplay: rescanning, gating and beam tracking. Several others techniques exist
to reduce the effect of tumor motion, such as abdominal pressure, jet ventilation, apneic oxygenation etc., but will not be described here, since they are far from the topic of this thesis.
\newline
\textbf{Rescanning} or repainting, is a techinque that uses advantage of statistical averaging of different interplay patterns \cite{Phillips1992}. Instead of applying the whole dose $D$ at once, the target is scanned $N$ times, each
time irradiated with $\mathrm{D}/\mathrm{N}$. The result is a Gaussian distribution of $D$ around the $D$ with no interplay (static case), as shown in Fig. \ref{rescanning}. With more rescanns (larger $N$), better dose homogeneity is achieved, because variance is proportional
to $\mathrm{1}/\mathrm{N}$. Technically the method is the easiest to impliment of the three mentioned, since no real-time motion monitoring is neccessary. However, it introduces additional dosage to normal tissue. Rescanning has not yet be
implemented clinically, but should be in the near future in several centers worldwide \cite{Furukawa2007, Zenklusen2010}.
\newline
\textbf{Gating} applies irradiation only in a selected part of the breating cycle in a so-called gating window (GW) \cite{Minohara2000,Lu2006}. Usually exhale position is used as the center of the GW, as highlited in Fig. \ref{gating}.
Motion monitoring singal is used to control beam extraction. While there is no additional normal tissue irradiation, the treatment time is prolonged due to the frequent beam interuptions as shown in Fig. \ref{gating}.
Conventional radiotherapy and passive beam shaping can also use advantage of gating to reduce the effects of motion on treatment delivery.
\newline
\textbf{Beam tracking} is a method, where the tumor is followed by beam throughout different motion phases in real time. Similar to gating, beam tracking is not limited to active beam shaping. It was even proposed originally 
for photons \cite{Keall2001} and later implemented clinically in x-ray radiosurgery in the robotic Cyberknife Synchrony system (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, Ca., USA) \cite{Brown2007a,Kilby2010}. Regardless of radiation type, 
fast beam delivery system is neccessary for beam tracking. In contrast to photon radiotherapy, beam tracking with particles need to pay special consideration to longitudinal changes. At GSI beam tracking system has been implemented.
The solution for longitudinal changes was carried out by two polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) wedges close to the target, that are operated via linear stepmotor \cite{Saito2009}, as shown in Fig. \ref{tracking}. Linear stepmotor can
change the relative distance between the wedges and therefore introducing more or less material that beam travels and consequently changes beam energy (range). The beam tracking system at GSI was able ta achive high precision \cite{Bert2007, Bert2009, Saito2009},
however, clinical implementation is not yet feasible, since internal motion monitoring that includes range change information in real-time is not fast enough.


The three motion mitigation techniques mentioned are not exclusive and can be used in parallel. Furukawa et al. made a study on a combination between rescaning and gating \cite{Furukawa2007} and Water et al. presented a combination
between rescanning and tracking \cite{Water2009}.

\subsection{Treatment planning}
\label{treatmentPlanning}

The task of treatment planning is to determine machine parameters in order to deliever prescribed dose to the target, while not violaiting maximum allowed dose to critical organs, also known as organs at risk (OARs) \cite{Richter2012}.
Treatment planning thus revolves around dose optimization process and it is highly dependent on delivery type used for treatment. The basis of treatment planning is computed tomography (CT), where deleniation of target volume and OARs is
done by physician. Additional imaging, such as magnetic resonance (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET), is often used as a supplement to CT for even better deleniation. In the following sections target definition will be explained,
as well as the basics of intensity modulated photon treatment (IMPT) and scanned ion beam treatment planning. Later will be further expanded into dose calculation for moving targets.

\subsubsection{Target definition}
The definition of target volume is crucial, since it has to cover the whole tumor, prevent furhter tumor spreading, while at the same time it should not be too big, to spare normal tissue.  \textbf{REF!}.

\begin{description}
\item[Gross Tumor volume:] \emph{The GTV is the gross
    palpable or visible/demonstrable extent and location of malignant
    growth.}
\item[Clinical Target Volume:] \emph{The CTV is a tissue
    volume that contains a demonstrable GTV and/or subclinical
    microscopic malignant disease, which has to be eliminated. This
    volume thus has to be treated adequately in order to achieve the
    aim of therapy, cure or palliation.}
\item[Planning Target Volume:] \emph{The PTV is a geometrical
    concept, and it is defined to select an appropriate beam size and
    beam arrangements, taking into consideration the net effect of all
    the possible geometrical variations, in order to ensure that the
    prescribed dose is actually absorbed in the CTV.}
\item[Internal Target Volume:] \emph{This is the margin that must be
    added to the CTV to compensate for expected physio-logical
    movements and variations in size, shape, and position of the
    CTV during therapy.}
\item[Organs at risk:] \emph{Organs at risk (OAR) are normal
    tissues whose radiation sensitivity may significantly influence
    treatment planning and/or prescribed dose.}

% conjunction with additional motion mitigation techniques. Optimization
% of safety margins is done during treatment planning which will be
% introduced later in this chapter. For reasons of clarity, the common
% definitions of treatment margins shall be given here already. The
% \ac{ICRU} recommends the definition of a number of volumes for
% treatment planning \citep{ICRU50,ICRU62}:


\subsubsection{Image registration and contour propagation}

\subsubsection{Treatment planning for scanned ion beams}

Modern three-dimensional treatment planning is based on a computed tomography (CT) of the
volume of interest. The volumetric dataset is the basis for the delineation of the target volume,
nearby organs and critical structures by a physician. Other fused volumetric data sets like mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emmission tomography (PET) can be used in support
during the delineation process. The common definitions of the different treatment volumes have
been introduced in the last section (cf. figure 2.12 on page 20). The core task of treatment plan-
ning is the dose optimization process. That is the determination of the machine-dependent
delivery parameters needed to yield the prescribed—usually homogeneous—PTV dose coverage
for a chosen beam configuration while minimizing the dose to normal tissue. According to rec-
ommendations by the ICRU, 100 % of the PTV volume should receive between 95 % and 107 %
of the planned dose (ICRU, 1993a). The dose optimization is normally performed in an iterative
computational way using a treatment planning system (TPS). Treatment planning strongly de-
pends on the employed radiation type and the beam delivery technique. The following section
will concentrate on the specifics for scanned ion beam therapy.
