Radiosurgery has the potential to become a new and non-invasive treatment modality for the most common cardiac arrhymia, atrial fibrillation. 
Irradiation with photons are known to alter the electrical pathway of the heart's conduction system \cite{Sha10}. Based on the 
experience gained in cancer radiotherapy promising results are expected by the usage of scanned carbon ion beams. In order to explain the 
underlying physical and biological differences between carbon ions and photons as well as other ions (e.g. protons), and the resultant benefits 
of carbon ions when irradiating a deep seated target, the physical and radiobiological fundamentals will be explained in the first section of 
this chapter. Furthermore the difference in radiotherapy application will be outlined in the second section, with special emphasis on the 
irradiation of moving targets. In the last subsection the basics of the heart's conduction system will be presented. Abnormalities, risk 
factors and underlying mechanisms causing cardiac arrhthmias in general and especially atrial fibrillation will be explained. The currently 
existing treatment modalities for atrial fibrillation, as well as their limitations and risk factors will be presented in order to motivate 
the benefits of a non-invasive treatment modality.

\section{Physical and biological basics of radiotherapy}
\label{pbb}
The usage of radiation for medical purposes is almost as old as its detection. Shortly after W.C. Roentgen discovered X-rays in 1895 it 
was first used for the treatment of a cancer patient \cite{Hal06}. With the development of accelerators and the resulting study of ion 
energy deposition profiles particles were almost immediately connected to their therapeutic implications and beneftis 
\cite{Wil46}. In the following the physical and biological fundamentals of radiotherapy will be presented.


\subsection{Dose}

The dose $D$ is defined as the deposited energy per unit mass \cite{ICRU93}:

\begin{equation}
 D = \frac{dE}{dm} ; \hspace{0.4cm} [D]= 1 Gy = 1 \frac{J}{kg}
 \label{dose}
\end{equation}

The magnitude of the deposited dose in an material depends, among other factors, on the used particle type, as they underlie different 
physical interaction mechanisms, which will be explained in the following. 


\subsection{Interaction of radiation with matter}

Photons and ions interact differently with matter, resulting in different depth-dose-profiles (see figure \ref{ddp}). While photons deposit 
their highest local dose shortly after entering the material, ions display an inverse depth-dose-profile. Thereby most of their energy 
is deposited in a defined area at the end of the particle track, the so-called Bragg Peak region, which is beneficial when irradiating a 
deep seated target as the dose to the surrounding healthy tissue can be drastically reduced. Even though the interaction 
mechanisms for the energy deposition of photons and ions occurs primarily through secondary electrons, the underlying processes 
differ.

build up. Ions on the other hand interact differently with matter, resulting in an increased dose deposition at the end of the particle 
track, the Bragg peak. Figure taken from \cite{Lue12}}
\label{ddp}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
% \newpage

\subsubsection{Interaction of photons with matter}

Photons undergo different processes when passing matter, like coherent scattering or Rayleigh scattering, photoelectric effect, Compton 
scattering and pair production. The probability for each process depends on one hand on the energy of the primary photons as well as on the 
atomic number of the absorbing material, while the strength of these dependecies varies in turn on the different processes \cite{Lil06}. 
The overall decrease of the photon beam intensity when passing a material can be described by the following formula:

\begin{equation}
 I = I_{0} \cdot e^{- N \sigma x} = I_{0} \cdot e^{-\mu x}
 \label{expdecrease}
\end{equation} 

where $I_{0}$ represents the intensity of the incident photon, $x$ the depth of the material in units of length, $N$ the atomic density 
of the material and $\mu$ is the attenuation coefficient. The latter is directly related to the overall cross section $\sigma$, which is a 
measure of the probability of the occurence of an interaction mechanism. It has contributions from all single interaction processes. 

\begin{equation}
{\sigma} = \sigma_{rayleigh} + \sigma_{photoelectric} + Z\sigma_{compton} + \sigma_{pairproduction} 
\end{equation}

In the energy range of radiotherapy (between 100 keV and 10 MeV) the dominating process is Compton scattering \cite{Alp98}. 
The attenuation of the photon beam results thus in the following way: 
The compton electrons are scattered in a strongly forward direction, leading to a build up effect in deeper layers of the material. The 
maximum of the depth-dose profile is reached when the electrons are completely stopped at a certain depth, which is called the mean electron 
range (and is dependent on the initial photon energy). Afterwards the dose deposition decreases exponentially (see eq. \ref{expdecrease}). 

% in which the photons induce electron oscillation in the medium, causing the emission of a photon with the same energy but other direction as the primary photon. 

\subsubsection{Interaction of ions with matter}

Interaction of ions with matter occurs via one of the following processes: elastic coloumb scattering from target nuclei (nuclear stopping) 
and inelastic collision with target electrons (electronic stopping). In the mildly relativistic region used in radiotherapy 
(energies of less than 500 $\mathrm{MeV}/\mathrm{u}$) the total stopping power of ions is dominated by electronic stopping, 
resulting in ionisation and excitation of the target atoms. 
% At very small ion energies, e.g. at the end of the particle range, nuclelar stopping start to contribute to the total energy loss. 
% The mean rate of energy loss is described in the Bethe formula \cite{Bet30} \cite{Blo33}:
The Bethe-Bloch formula \cite{Bet30} \cite{Blo33}, decribing the mean rate of energy loss of relativistic ions, can thus be corrected 
for low particle energies \cite{Nak10}, resulting in the following approximation:

\begin{equation}
- \left \langle \frac{dE}{dx} \right \rangle = \frac{ 4 \pi N_{e} z_{eff}^{2} }{ m_{e} v^{2} } \left( \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}} \right) ^{2} \left[ln \left( \frac{2m_{e}v^{2}}{I} \right)+correction \right]
 \label{bethe}
\end{equation}

where $N_{e}$ is the materials electron density, $e$ and $m_{e}$ are the charge and mass 
of an electron, $\epsilon_{0}$ the electrical field constant and $I$ the mean excitation energy of the absorber material. The effective 
projectile charge $z_{eff}$ can be approximated by the Barkas formula \cite{Bar63}, where $\beta$ is the projectile speed in units of 
$c$: 

\vspace*{-0.8cm}
\begin{equation}
 z_{eff} = z \left( 1 - e^{-125 \beta z^{\frac{2}{3}}} \right)
\end{equation}

The main dependecies of the mean rate of energy loss can be seen in equation \ref{bethe}. It is proportional to $z_{eff}$ 
and inversely proportional to $v^{2}$. The overall depth dose distribution can thus be understood in the following way: in the beginning 
the particles have a high energy and thus high velocity, causing the dose deposition to be small. While passing the material, the velocity 
of the projectile decreases, causing the energy deposition to increase. At low particle energies, close to the particle range, 
target electrons are collected hence causing $z_{eff}$ to decrease, leading to a decrease in dose deposition. This leads to a maximum 
enery loss around the particle range, known as Bragg peak. 

\subsubsection{Range straggling and lateral scattering}
\label{scat}
Even though electronic stopping via inelastic collisions with target electrons is the main interaction process in the therapeutic energy 
range, elastic coulomb scattering from target nuclei is still occuring and the main reason for lateral scattering. In an analytical 
approximation by Moli√®re \cite{Mol48}, the angular spread of the overall deflection in a material has been described. It is 
on the one hand dependent on the mass of the target nuclei, where a higher mass causes a larger angular spread for the same thickness 
of material. And on the other hand it is inversely proportional on the momentum of the projectile, causing carbon ions to have a smaller 
lateral deflection than e.g. protons. Experimental validation comparing carbon ions to protons having the same range in water 
(15.6 cm, 150 MeV protons and 285 MeV/u 12C ions) resulted in an approximately three times smaller angular spread \cite{Sch10}.\newline
\newline
Range straggling is caused by the statistical fluctuations of single electronic stopping events. In case of large number of collisions or 
thick layers of material these fluctuations can be approximated by a Gaussian probability distribution \cite{Bor40} 
\cite{Ahl80} \cite{Ric12}. This leads to an inverse proportional dependence between the ratio of the straggling width $\sigma_{R}$ with 
the mean range $R$ and the square root of the ion mass $M$ ( $\mathrm{\sigma_{R}}/\mathrm{R} \propto \mathrm{1}/{\sqrt{M}}$ ). This results 
in a smaller range scattering for heavier ions. Experimentally, the ratio between the straggling width and the mean range was found to be 
3.5 smaller for carbon ions compared to protons \cite{Sch10}.

\subsubsection{Nuclear fragmentation}

At large penetration depths, when the projectile ions have lost most of their energy, nuclear fragmentation processes start to be 
relevant for all ions heavier than protons. Mostly lower Z fragments are produced, which move with approximately the same velocity 
and in the same direction as the primary ions. This causes dose tails behind the Bragg peak position. Thus the resulting depth-dose 
distribution for all ions heavier than protons is actually the sum of the energy deposition of the projectiles and the resulting 
fragments. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{iondepthdosesum.png}
\caption{Depth dose distribution of carbon ions. Besides of the energy deposition of the primary ions (red), the produced fragments 
(blue curve) contribute to the overall dose deposition (black) and are especially visible in the dose tail behind the Bragg 
peak. Figure taken from \cite{Gro04}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In case of carbon ions, the produced fragments nevertheless also offer the chance for PET (Positron Emission Tomography) monitoring, 
without additional radiation exposure for the patient. As peripheral collisions are more frequent then central ones \cite{Kra00} 
isotopes like $^{11}C$ and $^{10}C$ are produced when $^{12}C$ ions penetrate through tissue. Both isotopes are $\beta^{+}$ 
emitters. They annihilate with electrons in the human body, producing two $\gamma$-rays which travel in opposite directions.

% \newpage

\subsubsection{Track structure}

For inelastic collisions with atomic target electrons, only about 20\% of the initial projectile energy is used to overcome the 
electron binding energy \cite{Kra92}. A high amount of energy is transformed into the kinetic energy of the secondary electrons, the 
so-called $\delta$-electrons. These $\delta$-electrons can in turn emerge from the primary particle trajectory and undergo frequent 
elastic and inelastic scattering. If their energy is sufficient high they can induce further ionisation in more distant locations, 
leading to a high number of additional electrons. The radial dose fall off is approximated by a $\mathrm{1}/\mathrm{r^{2}}$ law, 
illustrating that the radial dose quickly falls off with larger radial distance $r$ \cite{Cha76} \cite{Kat99} \cite{Ric12}. 
The range of the $\delta$-electrons is restricted to a maximum value according to the kinematics of the collision between projectile 
and target electron. Empirically this can be described by a power law \cite{Kie86}, where $E$ is energy of the primary ion:

\begin{equation}
 r_{max} \propto E^{1.7}
\end{equation}

As stated by the Bethe equation \ref{bethe}, the energy deposition of the primary ions is dependent on the used ion species and their 
energy. This results in a higher stopping power for higher $Z$ primary ions as well as an increased stopping power for smaller energies. 
Hence carbon ions have a much higher $\delta$-electron output than e.g. protons. Furthermore with decreasing energy of 
carbon ions, the $\delta$-electron output increases. This can be seen in figure \ref{track}. This difference in $\delta$-electron output 
is also the reason for the difference in induced biological damage. 

\subsubsection{Linear Energy Transfer LET}

The criteria for the occurence of direct or indirect actions causing DNA damage is dependent on the local energy deposition pattern. 
The critical measure for this is the linear energy transfer (LET). It is defined as the average energy deposited per unit length of track 
\cite{Hal06} and is typically given in keV/$\mu$m. Indirect actions are caused by radiation with a low LET (sparsely ionising), 
such as photons, protons and fast ions. Direct actions are caused by high LET radiation (densely ionising), such as slow ions.

\label{track}
\end{center}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Radiobiology}

It was described in the previous section that both, photons and ions, are ionising radiation producing $\delta$-electrons which 
in turn can cause subsequent ionisations. These ionisations attack the carrier of the genetic information, the DNA, of the irradiated 
cells and hence causes them to stop to proliferate. The biological background of these processes will be described in this section. 
Furthermore the enhanced biological effect of ions compared to photons will be explained. This is one of the potential benefits expected 
from a non-invasive irradiation of atrial fibrillation with carbon ions compared to photons. 
% As no biological dose or model will be used in the treatment planning studies of this work, the reader will be refered to \cite{} 


\subsubsection{Impact of radiation on cells}

In eukaryotic cells, meaning cells that contain a cell nucleus, the genetic information is stored in the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), 
making it therefore the critical target in radiotherapy. DNA is made of two sugar and phosphate backbones and four different basepairs 
(adenine A, cytosine C, guanine G and thymine T), which bind in a defined way (A with T and C with G) and thus form the double helix 
structure with a distance of the two strands of about 2 nm. The genetic information is encoded in the sequence of the base pairs. 
Ionising radiation can destroy the described structure of the DNA, either by direct or indirect action \cite{Hal06}.\newline
\newline
As can be seen in figure \ref{ida} direct effects are caused by the destruction of molecular bonds of the DNA itself 
through any form of radiation. This process is considered the dominant effect if radiation with a high energy loss along the particle 
track is used. Indirect action means that free radicals are produced by the ionising radiation, which then in turn can damage the DNA. 
This phenomenon is predominant when sparsely ionising radiation (like photons) are used and interact with molecules in the cell, 
particulary water.\newline
\newline
Both mechanisms can cause either single strand breaks (SBS) or double strand breaks (DSB) (see figure \label{ida}). SSB means that only 
one of the strands is destroyed, leaving the complementary base on the other strand intact and thus enabling a fast repair if the SSBs 
occur at a certain distance from each other. DSBs or clustered SSBs are more complex and can cause the breakage of the chromatin. But even 
these damages are usually steadily repaired. The repair mechanisms only start to fail when the DSBs accumulate to local lesions. Changes 
in the original DNA material is the result. Depending on the produced damage mutations, carcinogenesis or cell death can be the 
result. Cell death can occur in different pathways. Apoptosis is the controlled self-inactivation of the cell and the preferred 
pathway in radiotherapy. Uncontrolled cell death, necrosis, typically causes severe reactions of the immun system, leading to e.g. 
inflammation.

double strand breaks are visualised. Figure taken from \cite{Ric12}}
\label{ida}
\end{center}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Relative Biological Effectiveness RBE}

As outlined, at the same dose level radiation damage depends on the LET.  This means that the induced biological effect 
is, amongst others, dependent on the energy and type of radiation. This is described in the relative biological effectiveness (RBE), 
which is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
 RBE = \left.\frac{D^{ref}_{photon}}{D_{ion}} \right|_{isoeffect}
\end{equation}

$D^{ref}_{photon}$ is the absorbed photon dose necessary to induce a certain isoeffect and $D_{ion}$ the absorbed dose of ions at a 
defined energy which leads to the same effect. Comparison of RBE values are valid only for the same effect and biological endpoint 
and by using the same reference radiation. This idea is used in the local effect model (LEM) at GSI for the predicition of the RBE. By 
assuming that the biological effect is independent of the specific radiation type but rather on the energy deposition distribution 
in small subvolumes of the cell nucleus, RBE predictions are computed in relation to the known biological response of photons 
\cite{Krae03} \cite{Frie13}. Weighting the physically absorbed dose with the RBE results in the biological dose in units of GyE. \newline
\newline
%% XXX FIGURE RBE
The RBE depends on multiple parameters, like the for example the irradiated tissue and its repair mechanism, the particle type, the used 
dose level and the LET. The dependence between RBE and LET is illustrated in figure \ref{rbe_let}. In case of x-rays (sparsely ionising) 
the probability of an induced DSB is low and in general more than one track would be required to induce DSBs, resulting in a small RBE. 
Irradiation with a LET around 100 keV/${\mu}$m on the other hand is optimal in producing a biological effect, as the 
density of ionisation coincides with the diameter of the DNA double helix of about 2 nm distance. Thus radiation with this LET has the 
highest probability to induce a biological damage with DSBs. More densely ionising radiation (LET > 200 keV/${\mu}$m) produces many DSBs, 
thereby wasting energy as the ionisation events are closer together than needed. The RBE consequently decreases again, an 
effect known as overkill effect. 

% As the RBE is the ratio of doses producing an equal biological effect the RBE value for this radiation type is lower than for the 100 keV/${\mu}$m radiation. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{rbe_let.png}
\caption{Radiation with a LET of 100 keV/${\mu}$m has the biggest RBE for cell killing due to the fact that average seperation between 
ionising events coincides with the diameter of the DNA double helix (2 nm). Figure taken from \cite{Hal06}}
\label{rbe_let}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Concerning the increased biological effectiveness of ions it can be stated that it is only of advantage if the RBE is more pronounced 
in the target tissue compared to the normal tissue in the entrance channel. While protons exhibit an almost constant RBE throughout the 
energy deposition (a constant value of RBE = 1.1 is used), for ions heavier than oxygen the location for the highest RBE moves towards the 
proximal region of the depth-dose profile, starting to coincide with the plateau region \cite{Kra00}. For carbon ions on the other hand 
the position of the highest RBE value coincides with the Bragg peak region, offering the possibility of a beneficial treatment outcome. 

% In carbon ions, the RBE coincides with the Bragg Peak position \cite{Kra00}, thus enabling to deposit a smaller physical dose in the 
% target and to further reduce the dose to the healthy tissue in the plateau region.

\section{Radiotherapy}

The conventional method for radiotherapy remains the irradiation with photons. Nevertheless, the biological and physical properties of ions 
(which were described in the previous section) result in advantages for radiotherapy, ecspecially when treating deep seated targets. 
As a result, more and more ion facilites are opened worldwide, treating an increasing number of patients with protons and carbon ions. 
In this section the state of the art in treating static tumors with photon and carbon ion therapy will be summarised. 
Afterwards organ motion and the resultant difficulties, as well as approaches for motion mitigation will be presented. 

\subsection{Photon Therapy}

As can be seen in figure \ref{ddp}, a treatment of deep seated targets with photons can be carried out more effectively the higher the photon 
energy. Over the decades, different photon emission techniques were developed which allowed for higher photon energies \cite{Lue12}. 
Currently, photons in the energy range of 6-18 MV \cite{Ber06} are used. The photons are produced with the help of linear accelerators, which 
are used to shoot accelerated electrons on a target, thereby emitting bremsstrahlung which is then used for radiotherapy.\newline
\newline
Like the used photon energy spectrum also the application techniques developed over the last decades \cite{Buc05}. Two dimensional (2D) 
radiotherapy only allowed for lateral tumor shape conformity and thus to led a high dose deposition to the surrounding healthy tissue. As the 
imaging techniques advanced, the treatment became more conformal in all three dimensions. Three dimensional (3D) planning based on computed 
tomography (CT) scans allowed for accurate dose calculations for irregular shapes. With the development of IMRT (intensity modulated 
radiotherapy) the dose distribution has strongly improved. In IMRT a varying number of beams from different beam directions are overlayed, 
thereby modulating the intensity of radiation within each field. This intensity modulation is achieved by using multileaf collimators (MLC) 
(see figure \ref{lamellen}). 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.28]{lamellen.png}
\caption{Technical realisation of IMRT by the use of multileaf collimators (MLC), enabling a photon dose deposition conformal to the 
target volume. Each lamelle can be moved individually, enabling an intensity modulation. Figure taken from \cite{Sch01}}
\label{lamellen}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

IMPT is implemented in various ways through different centers, with the most common being the mounting of the 
photon radiation producing linear accelerator on a gantry \cite{Lue12}. A comparison between conventional 2D radiotherapy with photons 
and an IMRT treatment can be seen in figure \ref{imrt}. A comparison between IMRT and carbon ion radiation is visible in figure 
\ref{targetvergleich}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{imrt.png}
\caption{Comparison of dose distributions for 2D photon irradiation with two fields (left side) and IMRT (right side). Superior target 
conformity and better sparing of normal tissue can be achieved with IMRT. Figure taken from \cite{Buc05}}
\label{imrt}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Carbon Therapy}

As already explained in section \ref{pbb} ions display an inverse depth-dose profile and a higher biological effect compared to photons. 
This enables a high target conformity and a sparing of healty tissue, both of which are beneficial for radiotherapy. 
The photon depth dose profile on the other hand limits achievable target conformity for deep seated targets, as advanced as the application 
methods for photon therapy may be. Since 1954, when the first ion beam therapy was carried out with protons at Berkeley Lab 
\cite{Tob58} up till today, where mostly protons and carbon ions are used in particle radiotherapy, different projectile ions were used and 
their effect on target tissue studied.\newline
\newline
Due to the their higher momentum and thus smaller lateral scattering (see section \ref{scat}) the usage of heavy ions (heavier than protons) 
enables a better sparing of healthy tissue and ecspecially of organs at risk (OAR), even if they are close to the target volume. 
Furthermore for carbon ions their increased biological effectiveness coincides with the Bragg peak region. Thus both the physical and 
biological properties of carbon ions offer the possibility of a beneficial treatment outcome. 

\subsubsection*{Application technique}

As in photon therapy, ion therapy application and thus target conformity improved over the decades. In the first treatments with protons at 
Berkeley the beam was applied through the whole head of the patient \cite{Tob58}.\newline
\newline
Later passive beam application systems were developed, which are still used in some carbon ion facilites. 
Passive devices rely on three different beam shaping steps \cite{Chu93}. 
First the beam is broadened by scattering and then further widened by using range modulators like e.g. a 
ridge filter. Thereby an extended and flat, but still homogenous, field is formed which covers the tumor extent in longitudinal direction 
(Spread Out Bragg Peak: SOBP). Secondly, the range adjustment of the SOBP is achieved via flat degraders of variable thickness. Final 
conformity to the distal target border is achieved by patient individual compensators. Finally, collimators are used for a lateral 
conformity. A scheme of a passive beam shaping system can be seen in figure \ref{passive}. 
Passive beam shaping devices offer the benefit that the historically poor beam 
quality of research facilites - in which the first treatments were carried out - did not influence the homogeneity of the applied dose. 
Moreover, beam energy changes during treatment can be avoided, thus enabling a fast irradiation time. Nevertheless, passive beam 
application always require the manufacture of patient individual compensators and an unavoidable limitation in volume conformity. 
Material in the beam path means intensity loss due to lateral scattering and an extra dose exposure due to fragmentation.\newline
\newline
Active beam application methods are spot scanning, used at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI, Swiss) \cite{Ped95} or raster scanning, which 
was developed at GSI \cite{Hab93}. Instead of inserting beam shaping material many small pencil beams are used to generate a conforme dose 
deposition in the target. Active beam applications offer a very good lateral target coverage as well as volume conformity. 
In spot scanning, the energy and thus range variation is adjusted via range shifters. The lateral conformity is 
achieved in one direction by magnets and in the other direction by a linear motion of the patient table (see figure \ref{psi}). 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{passive.png}

\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{psi.png}
\caption{Scheme of the spot scanning system at PSI. Figure taken from \cite{Ped95}}
\label{psi}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


In raster scanning the target volume is subdivided into slices of the same beam energy, so called iso-energy slices (IES), with a typical 
spacing of 3 mm$_{H_{2}O}$ (the depth is given in water-equivalent distance). Each IES is then again subdivided into so called raster points, 
a regular grid of predetermined particle positions. Dipol magnets are used to deflect the particle beam to these grid point positions and 
the pencil beam is left there as long as it takes to deposit the predetermined intensity. The irradiation always start in the more distal 
IES, hence a certain amount of dose is already deposited in the more proximal slices of the target volume. This has to be taken into account 
in the treatment planning thus leading to the need of inhomogeous dose depositions. The distance of neighbouring raster spots are chosen in 
such a way that minor fluctuations in beam quality and position still results in a homogenous dose deposition. Typically a distance of 1/3 
of the beam's FWHM is chosen.

\subsubsection*{GSI pilote project}

Between 1997 and 2008 440 patients were treated with scanned carbon ions at GSI. Mostly head and neck tumors were irradiated. 
The typical fractionation scheme was 20 fractions on consecutive days \cite{Lue12}. An example of a resulting 
dose distribution with scanned carbon ions in comparison to IMRT can be seen in figure \ref{targetvergleich}. 
The treatment outcome for skull-based chordomas can be seen in figure \ref{chordoma}. In later stage, also prostate and spinal cord 
tumors were treated.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}

tissue and ecspecially organs at risk like the brainstem are drastically reduced for scanned carbon ions. Figure taken from \cite{Gro04}}

\end{center}
\end{figure}

The pilot project at GSI was carried out in a collaboration between GSI, the Heidelberg University hospital, the German cancer research 
center (DKFZ) and the research center Dresden-Rossendorf. Based on the success in treatment outcome the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy 
Center (HIT) was build, where patients are treated with scanned carbon ion beams on a regular basis since 2009 \cite{Com10}. 
Furthermore CNAO (centro nazionale di adroterapia oncologica, Pavia, Italy) started treating patients with scanned carbon ions beams 
in 2011 \cite{Ama04}. In total roughly 10,000 patients have been treated with carbon ions up to the beginning of 2013, whereof about 
2,000 patients were treated with scanned carbon ions \cite{PTCOG13}.

\subsection{Treatment planning}

Treatment planning is the optimisation process in which the needed machine delivery parameters are determined for a chosen beam 
configuration in order to yield the prescribed dose to the target volume, while minimising the dose to the normal tissue, ecspecially 
to the OARs \cite{Ric12}. In particle therapy treatment planning is based on CT scans, which represent photon attenuation through 
the different tissue types and can hence be converted to water-equivalent depths. On this patient image data the target and OARs are 
contured and the needed dose and dose constraints, respectively, are determined. For cancer radiotherapy the delineation of the 
tumor includes certain safety margins, defined by the International Commission on Radiation units and Measurements (ICRU). As some 
of these margins will be also used in the context of cardiac targets, they will be shortly introduced here. 

\begin{enumerate}
 \item [] \textbf{GTV (Gross Tumor Volume)}: "The GTV is the gross palpable or visible/demonstrable extent and location of the malignant 
 growth." \cite{ICRU93a}
 \item [] \textbf{CTV (Clinical Target Volume):} "The CTV is a tissue volume that contains a GTV and/or subclinical microscopic malignant 
 disease, which has to be eliminated. This volume thus has to be treated adequately in order to achieve the aim of therapy: cure or 
 palliation." \cite{ICRU93a}
 \item[] \textbf{PTV (Planning Target Volume):} "The PTV is a geometrical concept, and it is defined to select and appropiate beam size 
 and beam arrangements, taking into consideration the net effect of all the possible geometrical variations, in order to ensure that the 
 prescribed dose is actually absorbed in the CTV." \cite{ICRU93a}
 \item[] \textbf{IM (Internal Margin):} "The IM, commonly asymmetric around the CTV, is intended to compensate for all movements and all 
 variations in site, size and shape of the organs and tissues contained or adjacent to the CTV. They may result e.g. from respiration, 
 different fillings of the bladder, different fillings of the rectum, swallowing, heart beat, movements of the bowel" \cite{ICRU99}
\end{enumerate}

Based on this definition, the \textbf{ITV (Internal Target Volume)} is commonly used for the volume in which the IM encompasses the CTV. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{volumes.png}
\caption{Treatment planning volumes as defined by the ICRU. Figure taken from \cite{Ric12}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\vspace*{-0.3cm}

After delineation, the number of fields as well as the field angles are chosen in such a way that the OAR are spared as good as possible. 
As a result of treatment planning the ICRU recommands that 100\% of the PTV should receive at least 95\% and 
not more than 107\% of the prescribed dose \cite{ICRU93a}. The dose constraints of the OAR depends on the organ as well as fractionation 
scheme and radiation type and needs to be carefully examined in each individual case. 



\subsection{Organ motion in radiotherapy}

Many target sites are influenced by temporal changes. Depending on the underlying mechanism, one distinguishes patient positioning 
related organ motion, prior treatment, and organ motion inbetween treatment fractions (interfractional motion) or during a treatment 
application (intrafractional motion). The different organ motion types will be specified in this section. Furthermore motion acquisition 
strategies as well as techniques to overcome the motion influence, so called motion mitigation techniques, will be presented. Finally an 
overview over the treatment planning workflow including motion (four dimensional - 4D) will be given. 

\subsubsection{Motion types}

An overview of the different organ motion types is given by Langen and Jones \cite{Lan01}. Three main categories can be determined: 
patient positioning related motion, interfractional motion and intrafractional motion. Examples of these different motion types can be 
seen in figure \ref{motion}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.43]{motion_examples.png}
\caption{Examples of the three major motion categories. On the left side (a) a lung tumor is displayed, which moves due to the respiration 
of the patient (intrafractional motion). Interfractional position changes are examplary shown in the middle (b), where two CT scans of a 
prostate patient are compared. Density variations between two CT scans are shown in (c). Figure taken from \cite{Eng11}}
\label{motion}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Patient positioning} can cause changes in tumor shape as well as uncertainties in the tumor position. A difference in positioning 
between image acquisition (e.g. CT) and treatment delivery may introduce systematic displacements and hence threaten the outcome of the 
treatment. Patient fixation systems and dedicated protocols are applied to overcome this motion influence. Stereotactic fixation with e.g. 
masks are used on a daily basis.
The other two motion types however are purely internal and are distinguished occurding to the time scale they 
occur on.\newline
\newline
\textbf{Interfractional motion} occurs within hours and days, hence between two treatment sessions (if multiple fractions 
are applied). Anatomical changes caused by interfractional motion are manifold. Prostate cancer patients are often subject to position 
changes due to varying gut and bladder fillings \cite{Fok04}. For lung cancer patients, changes in the breathing patter are troublesome. 
Sonke et al. \cite{Son08} reported that even though the respiratory motion trajectory is often reproducible, the baseline of the tumor 
motion can vary significantly. Cancer patients in general are also subject of tumor shrinkage \cite{Mor09}. In order to mitigate 
interfractional motion, repeated imaging needs to be carried out (adaptive radiotherapy ART). \cite{Son10} \cite{Mur11}.\newline
\newline
\textbf{Intrafractional motion} occurs on a time scale of seconds to minutes. The main reason for intrafractional motion are respiration 
and heart beat. Even though the exact motion patterns varies from patient to patient, it can be stated that breathing is a quite regular 
and slow process, with a rather big amplitude. Heart beat on the other hand has a smaller amplitude compared to respiration, but it is a 
high frequency motion with 60 to 80 heart beats per minute compared to 10 to 15 respiration cycles in the same time. These two motions 
superimpose and the influence of both will be studied in the framework of this work when targeting sites in the heart. Different motion 
mitigation techniques for intrafractional motion will be presented in a seperate subsection. 


\subsubsection{Motion acquisition}
\label{Motionacq}
For a successful irradiation of the moving target, the intrafractional motion of the target site must be known during the treatment process. 
This is achieved by combining imaging techniques, like time resolved computed tomography scans (4D-CTs) with online motion measurement 
systems.\newline
\newline
For the aquisition of 4D-CT scans the motion signal is recorded during the imaging. The motion cycle is then divded into $N$ quasi-stationoary 
sections (so-called motion phases (MP)). In every MP a full regular CT scan is acquired. In order to achieve this data is recorded in every 
slice for a whole motion cycle. By correlating the data information gained from the motion signal with the recorded CT information, the 
scans are afterwards rearranged according to their affiliation to a certain MP. For more information on 4D-CTs the reader should be 
refered to e.g. \cite{Rie05}.\newline
\newline
For 4D-CT image sorting as well as for the application of motion mitigation techniques (see subsection "motion mitigation techniques"), 
the intrafractional motion of the patients needs to be assessed. A review of the different techniques can be found at \cite{Eva08}. 
One distinguishes between direct measurement techniques and surrogate signales. Examples for direct measurements are ultrasound and 
fluoroscopy. In fluoroscopy, the patient is irradiated with X-rays and 
the absorption pattern is displayed on a fluorescent screen, hence limiting the acquisition time of this method by the deposited dose. 
The monitoring time in ultrasound is not limited and hence a real time imaging is feasible \cite{Pra12}. Nevertheless 
influence of air limits the resolution and thus raises difficulties when being aplied in the thorax region of the patient. 
Surrogate signals detect variables which are directly related to the source of organ motion. Examples of these kind of techniques for 
respiration are methods which correlate the movement of the torso to the phase in the respiration cycle. This can be achieved for example 
by monitoring the height of the patient surface with camera systems or laser displacement sensors and the possiblity for additional 
infrared markers attached to the patient's body \cite{Tad98} \cite{Ber05} \cite{Sch04}. Alternatively the volume of the torso can be 
measured by using a belt-like strain gauge \cite{Li06}. Other approaches measure e.g. the airflow of the patient \cite{Kub96} \cite{Han99}.\newline
\newline
Combinations between direct measurement techniques and surrogate signal acquisition exist and are e.g. used in the 
Cyberknife system. Their Synchrony system (see also \ref{cardiacradiosurgery}) combines fluoroscopy (direct) with an infrared camera 
system (surrogate). The acquisition time needed for fluoroscopy can hence be kept low and is used only to check and update the correlation 
model of the surrogate system \cite{Sha10} \cite{Lue12}.


\subsubsection{Motion mitigation techniques for intrafractional motion}

In conventional radiotherapy and passive particle therapy, moving targets are treated by enlarging the safety margins to the target region 
(irradiating the ITV, which encompasses the target motion - see sections before). A homogenous dose distribution is thereby achieved. 
In treatment modalities like IMRT and particle scanning on the other hand the beam delivery interferes with the intrafractional target 
motion, causing local over- and underdosages in the target volume, an effect known as Interplay \cite{Phi92} \cite{Ber08}. 
The exactly resulting interplay pattern is dependend on many different factors, like the beam direction, the scanning speed, the motion 
amplitude and starting phase etc. Hence it can not be avoided or directly compensated. Thus techniques which mitigate the influence 
of the underlying target motion have to be applied. The three main techniques (rescanning, gating and tracking) will be explained in more 
detail.\newline
\newline
\textbf{Rescanning}, also known as repainting, is a specific approach for beam scanning and based on statistical averaging of different 
interplay patterns \cite{Phi92} \cite{Rie10}. Scanning the target $N$ times with a reduced dose of $\mathrm{1}/\mathrm{N}$ results in a 
Gaussian distributed dose around the theoretically intended one (see figure \ref{rescanning}). As the variance of the distribution is proportional 
to $\mathrm{1}/\mathrm{\sqrt{N}}$ the result will be better the more rescans are used. The technical realisation of rescanning is simple, 
ecspecially as it does not require real-time motion monitoring, and results in a homogenous dose to the inner region of the target when 
using enough rescans $N$. Anyhow it can lead to an increased dose deposition to the surrounding, healthy tissue and to under dosages in 
the outer part of the target volume. So far rescanning has not been used in patient treatments, but certain centers (e.g. NIRS \cite{Fur07}) 
and PSI \cite{Zen10}) plan it for the future.

\begin{figure}[H]

(solid red square). Figure taken from \cite{Ber09b}. }
\label{rescanning}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


% \vspace*{-1cm}

\textbf{Gating} is the interrupted irradiation of the target during a selected part of the motion cycle, the gating window \cite{Min00} 
\cite{Li06} (see figure \ref{gating}). Typically a gating window around the most reproducible motion states are chosen, which show a comparable 
small motion (e.g. end exhale in case of respiration). This technique is also used for passive beam delivery, as it reduces the size 
of ITV margins. In the gating window a small motion, the so-called residual motion, remains. In case of beam scanning this can result in 
small interplay effects. Different approaches are studied to overcome this drawback \cite{Fur07} \cite{Zen10} \cite{Ber09}. Gating requires 
online motion monitoring and prolongs the treatment time. For centers with passive beam delivery gating has already been successfully 
used \cite{Min00} \cite{Iwa10} \cite{Has06}.\newpage

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{gating.png}
\caption{Principle of gating. Line (a) is the respiratory signal. At end exhale the gradient of the respiration is flat, enabling an 
irradition without large effects of the target motion. The beam (c) is thus only applied during this time. The gating window is activated 
as soon as the respiratory motion crosses line (b). Figure taken from \cite{Min00}}
\label{gating}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\textbf{Tracking} of organ motion requires the adaptation of the beam position to the target motion in real time. It was originally proposed 
for IMPT \cite{Kae01} and requires no additional margins, nor prolongs the treatment time. Prerequisite of this medthod is a fast beam 
delivery system. Tracking is clinically used in the Cyberknife Synchrony system (see section \ref{cardiacradiosurgery}). 
In comparison to photon irradiation, tracking with particles needs a careful consideration and adaptation of longitudinal changes due to 
the Bragg Peak structure of ions. The implemented tracking system at GSI \cite{Gro04} uses fast deflecting dipol magnets, which 
are also used for beam scanning, for the lateral adaptation of the beam. The longitudinal changes are accounted for by two polymethyl 
methacrylate (PMMA) wedges, which are mounted on a fast, linear stepmotor close to the target (see figure \ref{tracking}) \cite{Sai09}. By 
changing the relative distance between the wedges, the beam penetrates PMMA with different energies, thereby changing its energy and 
hence position. Even though the high precision of the system has been proven \cite{Ber07} \cite{Ber10} \cite{Sai09} a clinical use 
is not feasible yet due to the lack of fast and precise real-time internal motion monitoring \cite{Ric12}.\newpage

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{tracking.png}
\caption{Principle of tracking at GSI. The lateral deflection is achieved via dipol, scanner magnets. For the longitudinal adaptation two 
PMMA wedges are mounted on stepmotors, enabling to change the depth the partice beam has to traverse. Figure taken from \cite{Gro04}}
\label{tracking}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Besides these major motion mitigation techniques, different combinations are currently studied. A combination between rescanning and 
gating is e.g. studied by Furukawa et al. \cite{Fur07} and a combination between rescanning at tracking by van de Water et al. \cite{Wat09}.\newline
\newline
As breathing is the main reason for intrafractional motion in most radiotherapy applications, many different other techniques have been 
investigated to directly mitigate the influence of respiration \cite{Lue12}. An example is abdominal pressure, which has been used in lung 
and liver cancer patients in treatments with photons \cite{Neg01} \cite{Hof03} and recently also for scanned carbon ions at HIT (treatment 
of hepatocellular cancer \cite{Ric12}). Jet ventilation \cite{Hof03} and apneic oxygenation \cite{RPTC12} are also used to partially or 
completly surpress respiration of the patient. 


\subsubsection{4D Treatment planning at GSI}

In order to account for intrafractional organ motion, time-resolved (4D) treatment planning is needed. The underlying data as well 
as the techniques for 4D treatment planning will be presented for the special case of scanned carbon ion beams at GSI.\newline
\newline
As in the static case, treatment planning for ions is based on CT scans. In the special case of motion, these CT scans are time resolved 
(4D-CTs, see section \ref{Motionacq}, Motion acquisition). In order to use the information stored in the 4D-CT, an image registration needs 
to be performed. With this a voxel-to-voxel mapping between the reference phase of the CT and all other motion phases is gained, hence 
yielding a spatial correlation between the individual CT phases \cite{Ric12}. Usually, rigid and deformable registration methods are 
distinguished. While rigid registration only contains linear transformation of the original object in all three room dimensions, 
deformable registration also accounts for compression. Registration is based on registration algorithms, whereof different approaches 
exist. Brock et al. \cite{Bro10} published a multi-institutional study where the accuracy of some of the available algorithms is 
presented. It can be stated that registration accuracy of most algorithms is in the order of millimeters, hence in the order of a CT 
voxel size \cite{Ric12}, but is dependent on the image contrast (resulting in less accurate results when the contrast is diminshed).

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.43]{registration.png}
\caption{End-exhale, 4D reference phase of a lung cancer patient with overlying deformation field to end-inhale in a) axial, b) coronal and 
c) sagittal view. Figure taken from \cite{Ric12}.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

4D treatment planning at GSI is carried out with the in-house software TRiP4D. It was mainly developed by Daniel Richter \cite{Ric12} and 
is based on TRiP98 as well as a predeccesor program devoleped by Bert and Rietzel \cite{Ber07b}.  
TRiP98 was developed for static target regions and was successfully applied in the GSI pilote project \cite{Krae10} \cite{Krae00} \cite{Krae00b}.  
It is a command-line-based software without graphical interface which runs on an IBM AIX operating system and is written in C 
programming, using a pseudo object-oriented structure. For a detailed description of TRiP4D functionalities as well as the software 
design and experimental verificiation the reader shall be referred to \cite{Ric12}. A short overview of some of the most important 
functionalities will be given.\newline
\newline
The \textbf{4DCT structure} was implemented as a sequence of 3DCTs with a distinguished reference CT on which the dose optimisation 
process is carried out. Thus the existing 3D functionalities, like the computation of water-equivalent path lengths, could be reused. 
Individual phases of the 4DCT are indexed by their position in the motion cycle. 
TRiP4D does not include native \textbf{image registration} functionalities but rather integrates and processes image registration output, obtained e.g. 
with the open source software package Plastimatch \cite{Sha07}. The resulting deformation maps need to be obtained in two directions 
(reference-moving and moving-reference) as certain steps of the treatment planning like contour propagation require the inverse deformation 
maps.
\textbf{Contours segmentation}, of target volumes as well as organs at risk, is carried out by a volume dataset model. Based on 
the 3D segmentation module of TRiP98 with planar polygons on axial CT slices, volumetric boolean mask (VBM) region of interest (ROI) are 
generated. 
%In order to ensure compability with external visualisation tools the VBM ROIs can be re-converted into polygon contours. 
With these VBM dataset no information is lost under spatial transformation and hence a propagation of the contours can be carried out. 
This is achieved by using the information from the deformable registration to transform the ROIs of the reference state into all motion 
phases.
The \textbf{dose optimisation} process in scanned carbion ion beam is complex for moving targets, as it results in a time-dependence 
of the beam delivery sequence and a change in the needed beam position due to target motion. In order to achieve this the motion of the 
patient needs to be monitored during treatment, enabling to detect the current motion phase in agreement to the acquired 4DCT.
Finally, the 4D dose deposition can be calculated, which is determined by the treatment plan, the time structure of the beam delivery and 
the patient motion. A temporal aligment of the treatment control system (TCS) with its beam delivery sequence (BDS) and the motion 
surrogate trace is thus needed. This enables an identification of the motion state in which each raster point of the treatment plans 
shall be irradiated. Based on the precessor programm by Bert and Rietzel the \textbf{treatment plan} is split into quasi-static sub-plans 
where the raster points and the corresponding intensities are divided according to the motion phase they shall be irradiated in. 
For the overall \textbf{4D dose calculation} in TRiP4D, the sub-plans are then collected over all motion states for each dose voxel. Thereby 
the voxel position is transformed according to the deformation maps and by accounting for the radiological density distribution of 
the respective phase of the 4DCT. The total physical dose results as a summation of the dose distribution from all motion states in 
the reference state. TRiP4D was extensively tested and verified in numberous experiments \cite{Ric12}.

dose is deposited in 3D. Figure taken from \cite{Ric12}.}

\section{Atrial fibrillation}

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. It occurs in $\sim$2 \% of the general population leading to over six million 
patients in Europe \cite{ESC10} and over two million patients in the United States \cite{CE09}. The lifetime risk of developing AF is 
$\sim$ 25\% in people over forty. Since age is an important risk factor for this cardiac arrhythmia the prevalence is estimated to double in 
the next fifty years due to ageing of society (see figure \ref{USincidences}).\newline

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=3]{af_incidences_us.png}
\caption{Trend of AF incidences. The black curve indicates the projected number of patients assuming no further increase in age-adjusted AF 
incidences. The green curve represents the trend assuming a continous increase in incident rates as evident in 1980 to 2000. Figure taken 
from \cite{Miy06}}
\label{USincidences}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Even though not in itself life threatening, it dramatically alters the quality of life of the patients and increases the risk of suffering 
a stroke. It is estimated that the stroke risk in AF patients is 5-fold \cite{Ben98} \cite{Wol91}. Moreover AF often remains undiagnosed 
(silent AF) and it is stated that one out of five acute strokes is attributed to AF \cite{ESC10}. Other late effects and related events 
include cognitive dysfuntions like vascular dementia and impairment of the left ventricular function. In general death rates are stated to 
approximately double by AF \cite{ESC10}, leading to a ten year survival rate of 25 \% compared to 46 \% in patients with a normal sinus 
rhythm \cite{ACC06}.\newline
\newline
In the following the normal signal propagation through the heart's conduction system will be explained in order to contrast the occuring 
differences in AF. Possible causes for AF and underlying risk factors as well as current treatment modalities will be presented.

\newpage

\subsection{Heart's conduction system}

The conduction system of the heart controls the generation and propagation of electrical signals, so called action potentials, that cause 
the heart muscle to contract and hence to pump blood \cite{Med}. The action potentials can originate spontaneously in any of the specialised 
cardiac muscle cells which form the conduction system. In a healthy heart each beat begins in the right atrium with an action potential 
from the sinoatrial (SA) node (see fig. \ref{condsys}). The SA node differs from the rest of the cardiac muscle cells by exhibiting a larger 
number of calcium channels. Depolarization is hence reached faster, shortening the intervals between different action potentials. This makes 
the SA node the natural pacemaker of the heart.
The signal then spreads across both atrial chambers causing the muscle cells to depolarize and hence to contract, a phase called the atrial systole 
which is represented as the P-wave in an Electrocardiograph (ECG) (see fig. \ref{ecg}). It is followed by a period of conduction (PR-segment in ECG) in which 
the signal enters the ventricles via the atrioventricular (AV) node. The AV node is located at the lower portion of the right atrium and is 
the passing point where every signal from the atria is received and slowly propagated to the ventricles. The action potentials pass the 
ventricles 
by entering the Bundle of His, spreading through the bundle branches and the Purkinje fibers and further along the ventricle walls. As the 
signal spreads the ventricles contract very rapidly (ventricular systole), which is displayed in the QRS-complex in an ECG. Atrial 
repolarisation also occurs at this time, but any atrial activity is hidden in the ECG by the QRS complex. As the signal passes out of the 
ventricles, the ventricular walls start to relax (ventricular diastole). The T-wave marks this ventricular repolarisation. The sequence of 
these events and the corresponding ECG traces repeat with every single heartbeat.\newline

In AF the atria perform a quivering motion and are hence not able to sustain a healthy pumping rhythm. An examplary ECG trace for AF 
can be seen in figure \ref{af_ecg}. 
% This is not in itself life threatening but it can dramatically alter the quality of life and increases the risk of suffering a stroke. 
Possible reasons and triggers for this abnormal action potential propagation are stated in the section \ref{AFriskfactor}.

\newpage
\subsection{Types of atrial fibrillation}

Based on the duration and presentation of the condition five types of AF are clinically distinguished \cite{ESC10} \cite{CE09} (see figure 
\ref{ecg}).

\begin{itemize} 
 \item[] \textbf{First diagnosed AF}: Valid for every patient presenting with AF for the first time. This classification is independent of the 
 duration, presence or severity of the condition. An episode must last for 30 seconds or longer.
 \item[] \textbf{Paroxysmal AF}: Recurrent episodes (two or more) of AF which is self-terminating within 48 hours. After this timespan the 
 likelihood of spontaneous conversion is low.
 \item[] \textbf{Persistent AF}: Conditions which are present for longer than 7 days or which require cardioversion, independent of the 
 duration of the episode. 
 \item[] \textbf{Long-standing persistent AF}: continous episodes of persistent AF present for more than 1 year. Rhythm control 
 interventions  are carried out in this patient group. 
 \item[] \textbf{Permanent AF}: classification when the existence of AF is accepted by patient and physician. Restoration and maintenance
 of sinus rhythm has either failed or has not been attempted. By definition rhythm control interventions are not carried out in these 
 patient class.  
\end{itemize}

Furthermore \textbf{silent AF} may present as any form of the stated AF types. As the name indicates, the condition is asymptomatic and 
hence undiagnosed. It usually manifests as an AF related complication like an ischemic stroke. About one third of people with AF are 
estimated to be unaware of their condition \cite{ESC10}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{af_types.png}
\caption{Different types of AF. Figure taken from \cite{ESC10}}
\label{ecg}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Usually AF progresses over time. Starting as short and rare episodes the condition develops into longer and more frequent attacks 
\cite{ESC10}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{af_over_time.png}

possibilities at the different stages of AF. The light blue boxes represent medication uptake which should prevent the formation of blood 
clots. These medications are recommanded in the majority of AF patients. The red boxes indicate system relief therapies while the grey 
boxes represent rate control measures. Figure taken from \cite{ESC10}}
\label{afovertime}
\end{center}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Possible causes for atrial fibrillation and risk factors}
\label{AFriskfactor}

The mechanisms of AF are not yet fully understood. The multifactorial mechanisms may influence and sustain each other. Triggers for the 
initiation as well as a substrate for the maintenance are needed. Current research indiactes that one can distinguish between focal 
mechanisms and multiple wavelets \cite{CE09}. For most patients with paroxysmal AF a localized, focal trigger can be identified. This is 
not the case in patients with persistent or permanent AF, where the multiple wavelet hypothesis is believed to be more accurate.\newline

An identified \textbf{focal trigger} site are the pulmonary veins (PVs). In their benchmark paper Ha\"{\i}ssagurre et al. \cite{Hai98} studied 
45 patients with frequent episodes of AF ( 344 $\pm$ 326 minutes episodes per 24 hours) finding etopic beats \footnote{beats which arise 
from cells outside the region in the heart muscle ordinarily responsible for impulse formation} originating from the pulmonary veins in 
94 \% of the cases. The underlying mechanism why PVs become arrhythmogenic in some patients while it remains dormant in others is 
still not clear \cite{CE09}. The reason why PVs can become arrhythmogenic at all is based on stages during the embryonic development, in 
which the common PV is incorporated into the left atrium. Immunohistochemical studies have shown that the composition of the PV and the 
smooth-walled portion of the left atrium are identical (see figure \ref{walls}) \cite{CE09} \cite{Dou06}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=4.0]{PVatriumTissue.png}
\caption{Schematic depiction of outer side of atrial chambers with pulmonary veins (PV), left atrial appendage (LAA), left atrial body (LAB),

with smooth-walled inner aspect (blue), which streches out over extracardiac segments of PV (blue area above and below dotted line). 
In A the structures are illustrated from the outside, while B shows the different tissue types from the inside of the atria. Figure 
taken from \cite{Dou06}}
\label{walls}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, according to the \textbf{multiple wavelet hypothesis} AF is sustained by the continous propagation of  several independent 
wavelets \cite{CE09}. These wavelets are propagating through the muscles of the atria in a chaotic manner. Interference effects between 
various wavelets lead to amplification or cancellation. As long as the number of wavefronts does not decline a certain threshold level AF 
is sustained.\newline

Recent studies have shown that \textbf{rotors} might be another possible trigger for AF. A periodic activity of a small number of rotors in 
the posterior left atrial wall PV region may activate the atria at exceedingly high frequencies and result in AF. Animal and computer 
models sustain this new finding \cite{Jal03}. \newline

Certain risk factors and indicators for AF can be found in the AF patient group \cite{CE09}. Ageing generally increases the risk of 
developing AF. The reason might be due to age dependent loss of atrial myocardium and the associated conduction disturbances. Hypertension 
is also an age dependent factor which is a risk factor for the incidence of AF as well as AF-related complications such as stroke and 
systematic thromboembolism. Alterations in the heart due to AF are possible and might result in a modified atrial contraction and an 
increased and irregular ventricular rate. Furthermore abnormalities in the blood flow are evident, resulting e.g. in reduced left atrial 
appendage flow velocities, an area which is considered the main site of thrombus formation in AF patients \cite{ESC12}. Thyroid dysfunction
can be the sole cause of AF and may induce AF related complications. 25 \% of AF patients are obese \cite{Nab09} and 20 \% suffer of 
diabetes mellitus requiring medication. Chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) is found in 10 - 15 \% of AF patients. Nevertheless it is possibly more a marker of general cardiovascular risk then an 
indicator for AF. Chronic renal disease is present in 10 - 15 \% of AF patients and it is suggested that renal failure may increase the 
risk of AF related complications \cite{CE09}. Independent of the stated risk factors AF has also a genetic component, especially 
considering an early onset of AF. In a study carried out by Fox et al. \cite{Fox09} with 2243 offspring participants it was stated that the 
risk of developing AF compared to no parental AF was significantly increased (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio of 1.85, 95 \% confidence 
interval). The results were even stronger when age was limited to an age younger than 75 in parents as well as their offsprings 
(multivariable-adjusted odds ratio of 3.23, 95 \% confidence interval). 


\subsection{Treatment modalities}

The treatment modalities for AF have two main goals: to reset the rhythm or to control the ventricular rate and to prevent the formation of blood 
clots \cite{Mayo} \cite{CE09}. The treatment strategy chosen for each individual patient depends on the type of AF and on careful 
consideration of patient individual factors, including potential further heart problems. \newline

Resetting the heart rhythm is the ideal treatment outcome and is carried out by cardioversion, either based on medication (anti-arrhythmic 
drugs) or electrically. In an electrical cardioversion an electrical shock is delivered to the heart of a sedated patient via paddles or 
patches. The shock stops the heart for a moment, giving the conduction system of the heart the possibilty to restore its normal activity. 
Commonly used anti-arrhythmic drugs are e.g. Amiodarone and Dronedarone. These drugs have severe side effects and can act proarrhythmic, 
causing also life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias \cite{Mayo}. Furthermore the risk of another AF episode is not reduced.\newline

If AF can not be converted to a normal heart rhythm through the above stated methods, the ventricular rate needs to be reduced instead. 
Heart rate control can be achieved either by the usage of different medication or by AV node ablation. Medications include for example 
Lanoxib, which can control the heart rate at rest but not during physical activity so that additional medication like calcium blockers or 
beta blockers are needed. These medications slow down the conduction through the AV node, hence controling the ventricular response \cite{ACC06}. 
In case that the medication is not working or the side effects are to severe AV node ablation is carried out as 
alternative treatment modality. Via a catheter the AV node is ablated, blocking the signals coming from the atria passing to the ventricles. 
This procedure requires simultaneously the implementation of a pacemaker to establish a heart beat. With this procedure the atria are still 
fibrillating, so that further medication with anti-arrhythmic medication as well as anticoagulants is required.\newline

For paroxysmal or persistent AF further treatment modalities include the surgical maze procedure or radiofrequency catheter ablation.\newline

The maze procedure is carried out during an open heart surgery and hence allows for very precise lesion patterns. Scar tissue in the atria 
are created by either using a scalpel, radiofrequency energy or cryotherapy. The procedure has very good success rates. In a recently 
published analysis of 48 studies (involving 3832 patients) it resulted that sinus rhytm was maintained in 83 \% of patients who underwent 
the maze procedure \cite{CE09} \cite{Kha05}. Nevertheless it requires open heart surgery, making it unsuitable for many patients. It is 
thus generally reserved to patients who do not respond to other treatment modalities or if it can be combined with other procedures which 
require heart surgery. \newline

In catheter ablation the main strategy is anatomic based, which means that it is assumed that AF is triggered and sustained by the same 
antomical sites (the PVs) in the majority of AF patients \cite{CE09}. In radiofrequency ablation a catheter is inserted into the patient 
through an artery close to the groin of the patient and fed to heart. The energy is then used to create a scar close to the junction between 
the pulmonary veins and the atria (see figure \ref{af_circ}).\newline

\begin{figure}[H]

\label{af_circ}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Various ablation techniques exist, including the PV isolation by segmental ostial ablation, circumferential PV ablation (see 
fig. \ref{af_circ}), wide-area circumferential ablation and antral PV isolation \cite{Ora06} \cite{Ora03} \cite{Ouy04}. Antral PV isolation 
and wide-area circumferential ablation was shown to be effective for both patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF \cite{CE09} \cite{Ora03}. 
In a randomized study circumferential PV ablation was found to result in a sinus rhythm in 74 \% of patients with chronic AF \cite{Ora06}. 
Linear ablation is another ablation technique which is either performed in combination with PV circumferential ablation or as stand alone 
technique \cite{CE09}. The motivation for this procedure is to interrupt reentries.\newline
\newline
Endpoint during PV isolation is to induce a complete electrical isolation of the PVs. This is confirmed by elimination of all PV potentials 
as well as entrance and exit block during pacing at multiple sites within the PVs \cite{CE09}. Freedom from recurrent AF can be predicted by 
termination and noninducibility of AF during catheter ablation \cite{Ora02} \cite{Ora06} \cite{Hai05} \cite{Hai04} \cite{Ora04}. Termination 
of AF indicates elimination of all triggers and drivers of AF while noninducibility indicates the absence of residual trggers and drivers 
that may initiate and perpetuate AF \cite{CE09}. Termination is hence not a reliable predictor in patients with paroxysmal AF while 
noninducibility is likely to predict that the patients are going to stay in sinus rhythm (see figure \ref{freedom_recurrence}).

% Alternatively also ablation with cryotherapy can be carried out, in which the heart tissue is not made desolate but rather freezed.\newline

\newpage

Independent of the used procedure, anticoagulants like Warfarin are used in a diversity of patients. In order to establish international 
criterias for risk patients who should uptake anticoagulants, the CHADS$_{2}$-VASc score was defined \cite{ESC12}.

\begin{itemize}
 \item [] \textbf{C}ongestive heart failure: 1 point
 \item [] \textbf{H}ypertension: 1 point
 \item [] \textbf{A}ge ($\geq$ 75): 2 points
 \item [] \textbf{D}iabetes mellitus: 1 point
 \item [] \textbf{S}troke: 2 points
 \item [] \textbf{V}ascular disease: 1 point
 \item [] \textbf{A}ge (65-74): 1 point
 \item [] \textbf{S}ex (female): 1 point
\end{itemize}

Patients who obtain at least 2 point in the CHADS$_{2}$-VASc score are prescribed anticoagulants. Patients with 1 point might be prescribed 
anticoagulants, alternatively asprin can be used. Patients with a score of 0 are supposed to only take asprin \cite{Fle}. The 
CHADS$_{2}$-VASc score has been validated in multiple cohorts \cite{Lip11} and it was shown that the CHADS$_{2}$-VASc is better then other 
scores (like the CHADS$_{2}$ score) at identifying low risk patients \cite{Pot12} \cite{Ole12} \cite{Van11} and as good as (or possibly 
better then) other scores in identifying patients who will develop strokes and thromboembolism \cite{Fri12} \cite{Ole11} \cite{Bor11}. 



\subsubsection*{Catheter ablation of AF: success rate and complications}

The FAST trial compared the outcome of catheter ablation and surgical ablation in a randomized study with a small patient population of 124 
patients. 63 patients were treated with catheter ablation, 64 with with the invasive surgical ablation. 
The complication rate in catheter ablation was significantly lower (15.9 \% complication rate in catheter ablation versus 34.4 \% in surgical 
ablation
% , driven mainly by procedural complications such as pneumothorax, major bleeding, and the need for pacemaker) 
but at the same time 
the success rate in treatment outcome was reduced (36.5 \% for catheter ablation versus 65.6 \% for surgical ablation after 
12 months) \cite{Boe12}. \newline

In two so-far conducted, nationwide survies the success rates of catheter ablation as a treatment for AF and the resulting complications 
were studied. The first worldwide, multicenter survey was published in 2005 using data obtained from 181 centers inbetween 1995 and 2002. 
From these centers 90 stated to have performed 12,830 catheter ablation procedures on 8,745 AF patients. 
It was stated that 52 \% of AF patients undergoing ablation were symptom free without the need of further antiarrhythmic medication and 23.9 \% 
of patients with the need of antiarrhythmic drugs. These success rates were achieved with the requirement of a 
a second (in 24.3 \% of patients) or even third (in 3.1 \% of patients) procedure \cite{Cap05}. Major complication rates were raported in 
6 \% of patients. These complications included 4 early deaths (due to massive cerebral thromboembolism in two patients, extrapericardial PV 
perforation in one patient and unknown reasons in one patient), strokes (in 20 patients), transient ischemic attacks \footnote{"mini-stroke"} 
(in 47 patients) and episodes of tamponade \footnote{fluid collects between the heart muscle and the pericardium, which is the sac containing 
the heart} (in 107 patients). 
In the second worldwide, multicenter survey, which was performed inbetween 2003 and 2006 \cite{Cap10} and included 85 catheter ablation 
performing centers (16,309 patients), an improvement in treatment outcome was shown. 
The rate for a successful treatment outcome without the need of further antiarrhythmic medication increased to 
70 \% while the rate with the need of further antiarrhythmic medication decreased to 10 \%, resulting in an overall success rate of 80 \% 
compared to 75.5 \% in the first survey. Concerning the number of needed procedures it was stated that 37.1 \% single treatments were performed, 
59.8 \% dual treatments and 4.1 \% triple treatments. When broken down by type of AF, the success rate without antiarrhythmic drugs was 
75\% for paroxysmal AF, 65\% for persistent AF, and 63\% for longstanding persistent AF. Major complications 
occured in 4.5 \% of all patients. These included 25 procedure-related deaths, 37 strokes, 115 transient ischemic 
attacks, and 213 episodes of tamponade \cite{Cap10}. \newline
% attacks, and 213 episodes of tamponade \cite{Cap10} \cite{Sto}. \newline

% An European survey from 2012 \cite{Arb12} studied the complication rates in catheter ablation. The acute severe complication rates of over 
% 1000 ablation procedures carried out in high-volume centers throughout Europe were reported to be 0.6 \% for stroke, 1.3 \% for tamponade, 
% 1.3 \% for peripheral vascular complications and 2 \% for pericarditis. Similar numbers were reported in an US study \cite{Hoy11} 
% \cite{Cap10}. These informations were obtained from voluntary survey responses and are thus likely to be biased, making the true 
% complications rate possibly higher than stated. In a recent analysis in 4156 patients who had an ablation procedure between 2005 and 2008 
% it was stated that the complication rate was 5 \% and that the rate of hospitalization in the first year after ablation was 38.5 \% 
% (including all possible causes) \cite{Sha12}. Ongoing trials are expected to give more insights in the next years. For now, risk 
% associated with AF ablation needs to be carefully weighed against individual 
% symptomatic benefit \cite{ESC12}. \newline

All these informations were obtained from voluntary survey responses and are thus likely to be biased, making the true 
complications rate possibly higher than stated. Ongoing trials are expected to give more insights in the next years \cite{ESC12}.\newline

Recent studies furthermore show that catheter ablation procedures in AF patients (ecspecially in the left heart) are associated with a 
substantial risk of developing silent cerebral embolism \cite{Her13} \cite{Gai10} \cite{Mar13} \cite{Med13} \cite{Schr10} \cite{Lick06}. 
These findings appear to be independent on the used catheter technology \cite{Sor13} and can not be prevented by oral anticoagulantion 
therapie \cite{Mar13}. Even though some studies conclude that the lesions created from silent cerebral embolism after catheter ablation are 
reversible and thus not associated with cognitive deterioration \cite{Sor13} \cite{Her13}, it is generally believed that silent cerebral 
embolism causes cognitive impairment \cite{Kne08}. A study by Medi et al. \cite{Med13}, which investigated the post-operative neurocognitive 
dysfunction in 150 patients undergoing ablation before and after the treatment, also stated a 13 \% - 20 \% incidence at long-term follow up 
of 3 months compared to a control group. \newline

Besides these major complications, which can be induced by the catheter ablation in patients with AF, general disadvantages in the 
treatment modality can be concluded. The relatively long treatment time of up to five hours \cite{Jong05} is a general risk for many 
elderly patients, as the procedure is carried out under general anaesthesia. As flouroscopy is used to monitor the catheter during some time 
of the operation, the patients are furthermore exposed to a relatively high dose (fluoroscopy duration of 56 $\pm$ 16 min) \cite{Ber10}. 
From an socio-economical point of view, catheter ablation also causes high costs. A total of 13.5 billion Euro are spent on AF 
patients each year in the EU \cite{Fus06}. 70 \% of these expenses are caused by the required hospitalization of the patients when undergoing 
a catheter ablation. \newline

It can be concluded that catheter ablation offers only a limited treatment success rate while major complications and even death due to the 
procedure occur. An alternative treatment modality, for example by a non-invasive procedure with carbon ions, would thus be beneficial.  


% Concerning the stroke risk in patients after the treatment, numerous recent studies indicate that catheter ablation procedures are

\subsubsection*{Heart irradiation and cardiac radiosurgery}
\label{cardiacradiosurgery}

Target sites in the heart have been irradiated in different procedures. Re-stenosis\footnote{reoccurance of blood vessel narrowing} after 
angioplasty\footnote{mechanical widening of narrowed blood vessel e.g. with a balloon catheter} is preliminary treated with vascular 
brachytherapy \cite{Nat99} \cite{Cot05}. Thereby a minimum dose of 8-16 Gy to a depth of 0.5 mm into the vessel wall is required, while a 
maximum vessel dose is stated to not exceed 32 Gy. Cardiac angiosarcoma, a very rare tumor type in the heart with rare long-term 
survival of the patients, has been treated with carbon ions at the Japanese facility NIRS \cite{Aok04}. A total dose of 64 Gy was given in 16 
fractions in a timeframe of 4 weeks. Follow-up of one and a half year did not show severe side effects.\newline
\newline
Similar to the techniques used in vascular brachytherapy, P\'erez-Castellano et al. \cite{Per06} studied the possibility to use $\beta$-radiation 
as treatment modality for AF. They thereby used a phosphorus-32 source wire centered within a balloon catheter in a study with ten mini swines. 
The delivered dose was calculated to 60 Gy at a depth of 1 mm from the contacting PV wall, resulting in observed PV fibrosis without PV stenosis 
or other side-effects.\newline
\newline
In 2010 a study by Sharma et al. \cite{Sha10} showed that they were able to successfully alter the electrical pathway of the heart 
noninvasively by using stereotactic robotic radiosurgery. In the CyberHeart system cardiac target sites in sixteen mini swines were irradiated 
under general anesthesia. The procedure was as follows. Cardiac CT scans of the anesthesized and intubated mini swines were 
acquired and an electroanatomic mapping \footnote{CARTO system; Biosense-Webster. Three known magnetic sources are used to calculate the orientation 
and position of the catheter tip in 3D, while at the same time the voltage values are determined \cite{bw}} was carried out before the 
irradiation in order to ensure that the mini swines had no electrophysiological abnormalities. The voltage was mapped to enable a comparison 
with the later to be induced electrophysiological effect. Different target sites in the heart were chosen. The respiratory motion was 
compensated by tracking with the CyberKnife Synchrony software, which correlates the outside motion of radiopaque markers on the chest wall 
with the internal motion 
% with a stated accuracy of less than 1.5 mm 
\cite{Ozh08}. For the cardiac motion an ITV approach was chosen. 
For nine mini swines the cavotricuspid isthmus was targeted, the AV node was irradiated in two mini swines, the pulmonary vein - left atrial 
junction in three mini swines and the left atrial appendage in two mini swines. Dose ranges from 25 Gy to 80 Gy were applied 
(cavotricuspid isthmus: 25 to 80 Gy, AV node: 40 to 70 days, PV: 38 to 40 Gy and left atrial appendage: 32 to 80 Gy). Post irradiation 
the mini swines were stored at a farm. The follow-up time was dependent on the irradiated target in the mini swine (cavotricuspid isthmus: 25 
to 89 days, AV node: 15 to 49 days, PV: 35 to 196 days and left atrial appendage: 16 to 33 days). 
In order to assess the irradiation outcome, the animals were again anesthesized and electroanatomically mapped. Afterwards the mini swines 
were euthanized and targets (heart) as well as organs at risk (lung, esophagus) were excised and fixed in formaldehyde. The results of the 
irradiation can be summarised as follows:
The irradiation of the cavotricuspid isthmus evolved during the study, leading to changes in the method of targeting. While all mini swines 
displayed a reduced conduction across the isthmus, only two animals showed bidirectional block and hence feasibility at 30 days and 40 Gy.   
Targeting the AV node, one animal had to be sacrificed due to pacemaker pocket infection. The other one showed at complete AV block at 49 days, 
after being irradiated with 70 Gy. For the left atrial appendage a decreased voltage was observed at 38 Gy after 33 days. For the left 
pulmonary vein the feasibility was shown as the left atrium showed no local activation in all animals (present from day 35 for all doses) 
(see figure \ref{LA_map}).
% 
% In the CyberHeart system, an advancement of the CyberKnife system, 
% sixteen mini swines were irradiated under general anesthesia. Different sites in the heart were targeted: the cavotricuspid isthmus, 
% the AV node, the pulmonary vein - left atrial junction and the left atrial appendage. Dose ranges from 25 Gy to 50 Gy were applied. 
% The respiratory motion was compensated by tracking with the CyberKnife Synchrony software, which correlates the outside motion of 
% radiopaque markers on the chest wall with the internal motion with a stated accuracy of less than 1.5 mm \cite{Ozh08}. For the cardiac 
% motion an ITV approach was chosen. An electroanatomic mapping (CARTO system) was carried out prior treatment in order to ensure that the 
% mini swines had no electrophysiological abnormalities and the voltage was mapped to enable a comparison with the later to 
% be induced electrophysiological effect. Post treatment the mini swines were stored at a farm for up to 196 days. For the different 
% target sites the following treatment parameters were used with the stated results. In nine mini swines the Cavotricuspid isthmus was 
% targeted with dose depositions ranging from 32 Gy to 80 Gy. A decreased voltage was seen after all dosages and a bidirectional block 
% was seen after 33 days for 40 Gy. The left atrial appendage was irradiated in two swines with dosages ranging from 32 Gy to 80 Gy. A 
% decreased voltage was observed at 38 Gy after 33 days. The left pulmonary vein junction was irradiated in three swines with 38 Gy to 40 Gy. 
% The assessment after treatment was carried out from 89 to 196 days. In all cases a decreased voltage was observed. Two swines had their 
% AV node irradiated with doses ranging from 40 Gy to 70 Gy. One animal was euthanized after 15 days due to a pacemaker pocket infection,
% the other two were examined 25 to 108 days post treatment. A third-degree block was stated to have been observed at 49 days.

\label{LA_map}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Sharma et al. stated that a dose of 25 Gy or larger was needed to see a change in the electrophysiological properties in the animal model 
after 30 or more days. Overall it was proven that stereotactic radiosurgery has the potential to 
become a noninvasive treatment modality for e.g. atrial fibrillation. \newline
% With the CyberHeart system  treatment times were estimated to lie 
% between 60 and 120 minutes. Lateral scattering of the photons was stated to not exceed 0.05 \% of the target dose in a distance of 1 m 
% from the target, resulting e.g. in a maximum dose of 20 mGy (combined leakage and scatter dose) when irradiating a prescribed dose 
% of 40 Gy. \newline

A subsequent study carried out with the CyberHeart system \cite{Mag11} only targeted the pulmonary veins atrial junction. Two miniswines 
were irradiated with a single fraction treatment of 25 Gy and 35 Gy, respectively and followed for 6 months. It was stated that both animals 
showed circumferential fibrosis, leading to an electrical isolation of the PVs, which was detected with an electroanatomic mapping. 
The miniswine irradiated with 35 Gy showed more extensive necrosis and vasculitis in intramyocardial vessels. It was hence implied that 
25 Gy are sufficient to induce a PV isolation with no major complications in the studied timespan. \newline

In an animal study carried out by Blanck et al. \cite{Bla13} 8 miniswines were irradiated with a single fraction of seven fields with doses 
between 17.5 Gy and 35 Gy. A 5D-ITV concept was applied, hence applying internal margins to the upper right PV accounting for the respiratory 
and heartbeat. Prior treatment electroanatomic mapping was carried out. The animals were followed for 6 months. In this study it was stated 
that no electrical isolation of the PVs could be achieved. A reduction of the electrical signal procession with correlating transmural 
fibrosis in the target region was observed at doses above 30 Gy. Nevertheless stenosis in one branch of the PV was observed for the highest 
applied dose.\newline

All these studies were carried out with photon irradation. Due to the physical and biological properties of carbon ions (see section \ref{pbb}) 
an improved outcome is expected when treating these deep seated target volumes while aiming to spare the critical organs close by. 
The feasibility of this treament modalities with scanned carbon ions is the aim of this work. 


% \subsubsection*{Cardiovascular complications as risk factor for radiation}
% 
% Besides targeting areas in the heart, different radiation processes include the exposure of the heart as an organ at risk to irradiation. 
% Different dose levels are connected to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Total body irraditions as well as highly nonuniformal dose 
% deposition in the treatment of e.g. breast cancer and Hodgkin's lymphoma, are both known to increase the risk of 'radiation-induced' heart 
% diseases (RIHD).\newline
% \newline
% Information on the consequence of total body irradiation (TBI) was demonstrated in the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. In this population the 
% mortality of cardiovascular diseases was drastically increased more than 40 years after exposure \cite{Bak11} \cite{Pre03}. The dose deposition 
% in an atomic bomb was determined as an acute dose of 1-2 Gy. The mortality risk increased by 17 \% per Gy after TBI between 0 and 4 Gy.\newline
% \newline
% In the mid 1960s it has been recognized that cancer radiotherapy can cause damage to the heart and the pericardium\footnote{double-walled 
% sac containing the heart} \cite{Coh67}. Ecspecially irradiation of breast cancer and Hodgkin's lymphoma\footnote{cancer of the 
% lymphatic system} patients yield highly nonuniformal dose depositions in the cardiac region. Various studies analyse the potential increase of 
% RIHD as a health concern in these patient groups. RIHD can include a variety of diseases, depending on the component 
% involved \cite{Jaw13}. Particular increase exist in coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, valvular heart diseases, pericardial 
% disease, conduction abnormalities and sudden cardiac death \cite{Ale03} \cite{Swe07} \cite{Ng02} \cite{Hei03} \cite{Wet09} (1-5 in Jaw13). 
% It is stated that cardiovascular diseases are the most common nonmalignant death cause in breat cancer and Hodgkin's lymphoma patients treated 
% with radiotherapy \cite{Ale03} \cite{Ng11} \cite{Hop97} \cite{Pat11} \cite{Jaw13} \cite{Lan13} (+6-8 in Jaw13). 
% As these radiation effects are late effects, usually appearing after the second or third decade after radiotherapy 
% \cite{Ale03} \cite{Swe07} \cite{Wat09} \cite{Cas11} (+ 10 in Jaw13) many of the now studied 
% patients were irradiated with now out-dated protocols and fractionation schemes \cite{Jaw13}. Improved radiation techniques have been 
% developed over the years to minimise the radiation to the heart. Nevertheless the residual risk remains unclear.\newline
% \newline
% The largest study exploring the impact of nonmalignant death causes for breast cancer patient was carried out by the Early Breast Cancer 
% Trialists Collaborative Groupt \cite{Ear00} (24 in Jaw13). The study showed that the 20 year survival 69.5 \% among those who underwent 
% radiotherapy while it was 73.8 \% in the control group (in absence of any cancer patient deaths). Comparing the benefit of radiotherapy 
% to the late-effects it was stated that the annual mortality rate from breast cancer was decreased by 13 \%  through radiotherapy, while the 
% mortality by other causes was increased by 21 \%, again by using now out-dated and as suboptimal considered radiation techniques and 
% protocols. Radiotherapy of left-sided versus right-sided breast cancer was also used as an indicator for risk of mortality from 
% cardiovascular diseases \cite{Bak11}. Data analysis of the U.S. Surveillance Epidemiology and End Result (SEER) cancer registries \cite{Dar05}
% (28 in Bak11) resulted in an mortality ratio of 1.6 in left-sided versus right-sided incidences. It was furthermore stated that the 
% risk increased over time (1.04 for less than 5 years after diagnosis, to 1.1 for 5-10 years, to 1.37 for 10-15 years and to 1.53 for 15 years 
% or more). A recent population-based control study from Darby et al. \cite{Dar13} (eigenes Paper) dealed with the risk of breast cancer patients 
% developing ischemic heart diseases. The study included 2168 women who underwent radiotherapy for breast cancer between 1958 and 2001 in Sweden 
% and Denmark (963 women with major coronary events and 1205 control patients). It was stated that major coronary events increased linearly with 
% the mean dose to the heart by 7.4 \% per Gy, whereas no threshold was observed. This increase was observed within 5 years after radiotherapy and 
% continued up to 30 years.\newline
% \newline
% Hodgkin's lymphoma is the most common cancer in young adults. It has high survival rates if recognized at an early stage (approaching 85 \%

% causes in the cured patient group after radiotherapy \cite{Swe07} \cite{Lee00} \cite{Rij08} \cite{Gla98} (+15,17,18 in Jaw13). Up to 88 \%

% It can be concluded that there is compelling evidence that radiotherapy in the chest area can increase the risk of the patient to suffer 
% a radiation induced heart disease. The development depends on a variety of factors like e.g. the total dose 
% radiation, the fraction dose used per day, the area of heart exposed to radiation and the use of certain chemotherapeutic drugs \cite{Gay05} \cite{Car07} 
% \cite{Jon07} (+ 16,und 61 in Jaw13). The risk becomes apparent in doses higher than 30 Gy \cite{Lan13}, nevertheless smaller doses might 
% cause similar effects and no apparent threshold dose was so far observed. Latence time of at least 5 years after radiotherapy are often 
% stated and continue up to three decades post treatment. Furthermore many risk factors for cancer are shared risk factors of

% \cite{Lan13}, which might lead to a possible accerleration of RIHD.
