	Abstract = {{FFTW} is an implementation of the discrete Fourier transform {(DFT)} that adapts to the hardware in order to maximize performance. This paper shows that such an approach can yield an implementation that is competitive with hand-optimized libraries, and describes the software structure that makes our current {FFTW3} version flexible and adaptive. We further discuss a new algorithm for real-data {DFTs} of prime size, a new way of implementing {DFTs} by means of machine-specific single-instruction, multiple-data {(SIMD)} instructions, and how a special-purpose compiler can derive optimized implementations of the discrete cosine and sine transforms automatically from a {DFT} algorithm.},

	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}

To evaluate an automated {4D-CT} contouring propagation tool by its impact on the inter- and intra-physician variability in lung tumour delineation.


{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}

In a previous study, six radiation oncologists contoured the gross tumour volume {(GTV)} and nodes on 10 phases of the {4D-CT} dataset of 10 lung cancer patients to examine the intra- and inter-physician variability. In this study, a model-based deformable image registration algorithm was used to propagate the {GTV} and nodes on each phase of the same {4D-CT} datasets. A blind review of the contours was performed by each physician and edited. Inter- and intra-physician variability for both the manual and automated methods was assessed by calculating the centroid motion of the {GTV} using the Pearson correlation coefficient and the variability in the internal gross tumour volume {(IGTV)} overlap using the Dice similarity coefficient {(DSC).}


{RESULTS}

The time for manual delineation was (42.7$\pm$18.6)min versus (17.7$\pm$5.4)min when the propagation tool was used. A significant improvement in the mean Pearson correlation coefficient was also observed. There was a significant decrease in mean {DSC} in only 1 out of 10 primary {IGTVs} and 2 out of 10 nodal {IGTVs.} Intra-physician variability was not significantly impacted {(DSC{\textgreater}0.742).}


{CONCLUSIONS}

Automated {4D-CT} propagation tools can significantly decrease the {IGTV} delineation time without significantly decreasing the inter- and intra-physician variability.},

	Abstract = {{PURPOSE}

Implementation and experimental assessment of a real-time dose compensation system for beam tracking in scanned carbon beam therapy of intrafractionally moving targets.


{METHODS}

A real-time dose compensation functionality has been developed and implemented at the experimental branch of the beam tracking system at {GSI} Helmholtzzentrum f{\"u}r Schwerionenforschung {(GSI).} Treatment plans for different target geometries have been optimized. They have been delivered using scanned carbon ions with beam tracking {(BT)} and real-time dose compensation combined with beam tracking {(RDBT)}, respectively. Target motion was introduced by a rotating table. Dose distributions were assessed by ionization chamber measurements and dose reconstructions. These distributions have been compared to stationary delivery for {BT} as well as {RDBT.} Additionally simulations have been performed to investigate the dependence of delivered dose distributions on varying motion starting phases for {BT} and {RDBT}, respectively.


{RESULTS}

Average measured dose differences between static delivery and motion influenced delivery could be reduced from 27-68 {mGy} when {BT} was used to 12-37 {mGy} when {RDBT} was used. Nominal dose was 1000 {mGy.} Simulated dose deliveries showed improvements in dose delivery and robustness against varying starting motion phases when {RDBT} was used.


{CONCLUSIONS}

A real-time dose compensation functionality extending the existing beam tracking functionality has been implemented and verified by measurements. Measurements and simulated dose deliveries show that real-time dose compensation can substantially improve delivered dose distributions for large rotational target motion compared to beam tracking alone.},

@article{Montagnat2005,
	Abstract = {Segmentation of time series of {3D} cardiac images is clinically used for the assessment of the mechanical function of the left ventricle. To take into account the {4D} {(3D+T)} nature of those images, we propose to extend the deformable surface framework by introducing time-dependent constraints. Thus, in addition to computing an internal force for enforcing the regularity of the deformable model, prior motion knowledge is introduced in the deformation process through either temporal smoothing or trajectory constraints. In this paper, deformable surfaces are represented as simplex meshes owing to their generality and their ability to compute mean curvature at each vertex. The segmentation accuracy of this {4D} deformable model is estimated on synthetic {SPECT} image sequences for which a ground truth about the {LV} volume is known. Segmentation of non-synthetic {SPECT} and other modalities {4D} images is also discussed.},

	Abstract = {At present, beam ion beam therapy has started to spread worldwide. In Europe and Asia, combined carbon/proton facilities are favored, but in the {US}, only proton centers are under construction. This development is partially due to the different funding procedures and partially due to the more complex physical and especially biologic features of the heavy ions. In this article, the basic properties of both ions are presented, and their features for therapy are outlined. This refers to the dose conformity, the general precision of the treatment, and the ability to monitor via in-beam positron emission tomography the ions range inside the patient. Then the very complex biologic features are treated, and, finally, the treatment plans are compared.},

The ion-kill effect is more severe, where the fraction of cells experiencing ion kill is responsible for a decrease in the oxygen enhancement ratio, and an increase in relative biological effectiveness, but these are accompanied by loss of repair, hence to a reduction in the efficiency of fractionation in high {LET} therapy, as shown by our calculations for radiobiological effects in the {\^a}€{\oe}spread out Bragg Peak{\^a}€.},

	Abstract = {Purpose
To determine the impact of filling volume changes of the urinary bladder and rectum on organ motion and dose distribution of the bladder and rectum during radical radiotherapy for bladder cancer and to calculate the internal margins to secure target coverage.
Methods and materials
In 15 patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer, a planning {CT} scan was performed with a bladder and rectal catheter, followed by three immediate {CT} scans with various filling of the urinary bladder and rectum. After 20 fractions, a fifth {CT} scan, without catherization, was performed. In each {CT} study, the bladder and rectum volumes were delineated and matched to the planning {CT} scan to measure the organ motion and calculate internal margins. These margins were compared with an isotropic standard margin of 2 cm. Dose{\^a}€``volume histograms were analyzed to describe the dose distribution in the bladder and rectum corresponding to various filling volumes.
Results
Bladder movement was most pronounced in the anterior and cranial directions. The internal margins required to cover the bladder movements due to filling of the bladder and rectum in 87\% of the patients were 2.4 cm in the anterior, 1.1 cm in the posterior, 3.5 cm in the cranial, 0.5 cm in the caudal, and 1.3 cm in the lateral direction.
Conclusion
The filling volumes of the bladder and rectum have a large impact on bladder movements, especially in the anterior and cranial directions. This should be included in the internal target volume with the introduction of anisotropic margins in conformal radiotherapy for bladder cancer.},

	Abstract = {Purpose
Interfraction and intrafraction changes in amplitude of liver motion were assessed in patients with liver cancer treated with {kV} cone beam computed tomography {(CBCT)-guided} stereotactic body radiation therapy {(SBRT).}
Methods and Materials
A total of 314 {CBCTs} obtained with the patient in the treatment position immediately before and after each fraction, and 29 planning {4DCTs} were evaluated in 29 patients undergoing six-fraction {SBRT} for unresectable liver cancer, with (n = 15) and without (n = 14) abdominal compression. Offline, the {CBCTs} were sorted into 10 bins, based on phase of respiration. Liver motion amplitude was measured using liver-to-liver alignment from the end-exhale and end-inhale {CBCT} and four-dimensional {CT} reconstructions. Inter- and intrafraction amplitude changes were measured from the difference between the {pre-SBRT} {CBCTs} relative to the planning four-dimensional {CT}, and from the {pre-SBRT} and {post-SBRT} {CBCTs}, respectively.
Results
Mean liver motion amplitude for all patients (range) was 1.8 (0.1{\^a}€``7.0), 8.0 (0.1{\^a}€``18.8), and 4.3 (0.1{\^a}€``12.1) mm in the mediolateral {(ML)}, craniocaudal {(CC)}, and anteroposterior {(AP)} directions, respectively. Mean absolute inter- and intrafraction liver motion amplitude changes were 1.0 {(ML)}, 1.7 {(CC)}, and 1.6 {(AP)} mm and 1.3 {(ML)}, 1.6 {(CC)}, and 1.9 {(AP)} mm, respectively. No significant correlations were found between intrafraction amplitude change and intrafraction time (range, 4:56{\^a}€``25:37min:sec), and between inter- and intrafraction amplitude changes and liver motion amplitude. Intraobserver reproducibility ({\"I}ƒ, n = 29 fractions) was 1.3 {(ML)}, 1.4 {(CC)}, and 1.4 {(AP)} mm.
Conclusions
For the majority of liver {SBRT} patients, the change in liver motion amplitude was minimal over the treatment course and showed no apparent relationships with the magnitude of liver motion and intrafraction time.},

	Abstract = {High-energy protons and carbon ions exhibit an inverse dose profile allowing for increased energy deposition with penetration depth. Additionally, heavier ions like carbon beams have the advantage of a markedly increased biological effectiveness characterized by enhanced ionization density in the individual tracks of the heavy particles, where {DNA} damage becomes clustered and therefore more difficult to repair, but is restricted to the end of their range. These superior biophysical and biological profiles of particle beams over conventional radiotherapy permit more precise dose localization and make them highly attractive for treating anatomically complex and radioresistant malignant tumors but without increasing the severe side effects in the normal tissue. More than half a century since Wilson proposed their use in cancer therapy, the effects of particle beams have been extensively investigated and the biological complexity of particle beam irradiation begins to unfold itself. The goal of 
this review is to provide an as comprehensive and up-to-date summary as possible of the different radiobiological aspects of particle beams for effective application in cancer treatment.},

	Abstract = {Respiratory motion can cause significant dose delivery errors in conformal radiation therapy for thoracic and upper abdominal tumors. Four-dimensional computed tomography {(4D} {CT)} has been proposed to provide the image data necessary to model tumor motion and consequently reduce these errors. The purpose of this work was to compare {4D} {CT} reconstruction methods using amplitude sorting and phase angle sorting. A 16-slice {CT} scanner was operated in cin{\'e} mode to acquire 25 scans consecutively at each couch position through the thorax. The patient underwent synchronized external respiratory measurements. The scans were sorted into 12 phases based, respectively, on the amplitude and direction (inhalation or exhalation) or on the phase angle (0-360 degrees) of the external respiratory signal. With the assumption that lung motion is largely proportional to the measured respiratory amplitude, the variation in amplitude corresponds to the variation in motion for each phase. A smaller 
variation in amplitude would associate with an improved reconstructed image. Air content, defined as the amount of air within the lungs, bronchi, and trachea in a 16-slice {CT} segment and used by our group as a surrogate for internal motion, was correlated to the respiratory amplitude and phase angle throughout the lungs. For the 35 patients who underwent quiet breathing, images (similar to those used for treatment planning) and animations (used to display respiratory motion) generated using amplitude sorting displayed fewer reconstruction artifacts than those generated using phase angle sorting. The variations in respiratory amplitude were significantly smaller {(P} {\textless} 0.001) with amplitude sorting than those with phase angle sorting. The subdivision of the breathing cycle into more (finer) phases improved the consistency in respiratory amplitude for amplitude sorting, but not for phase angle sorting. For 33 of the 35 patients, the air content showed significantly improved {(P} {\textless} 0.001) 
correlation with the respiratory amplitude than with the phase angle, suggesting a stronger relationship between internal motion and amplitude. Overall, amplitude sorting performed better than phase angle sorting for 33 of the 35 patients and equally well for two patients who were immobilized with a stereotactic body frame and an abdominal compression plate.},

Among model-based techniques, deformable models offer a unique and powerful approach to image analysis that combines geometry, physics and approximation theory. They have proven to be effective in segmenting, matching and tracking anatomic structures by exploiting (bottom-up) constraints derived from the image data together with (top-down) a priori knowledge about the location, size and shape of these structures. Deformable models are capable of accommodating the significant variability of biological structures over time and across different individuals. Furthermore, they support highly intuitive interaction mechanisms that, when necessary, allow medical scientists and practitioners to bring their expertise to bear on the model-based image interpretation task. This article reviews the rapidly expanding body of work on the development and application of deformable 
models to problems of fundamental importance in medical image analysis, including segmentation, shape representation, matching and motion tracking.},

This article describes the software solutions in 4 broad areas: deformable image registration, adaptive replanning, real-time image guidance, and dose calculation and accumulation.

	Abstract = {We developed an efficient technique to auto-propagate parotid gland contours from planning {kVCT} to daily {MVCT} images of head-and-neck cancer patients treated with helical tomotherapy. The method deformed a {3D} surface mesh constructed from manual {kVCT} contours by B-spline free-form deformation to generate optimal and smooth contours. Deformation was calculated by elastic image registration between {kVCT} and {MVCT} images. Data from ten head-and-neck cancer patients were considered and manual contours by three observers were included in both {kVCT} and {MVCT} images. A preliminary inter-observer variability analysis demonstrated the importance of contour propagation in tomotherapy application: a high variability was reported in {MVCT} parotid volume estimation (p = 0.0176, {ANOVA} test) and a larger uncertainty of {MVCT} contouring compared with {kVCT} was demonstrated by {DICE} and volume variability indices {(Wilcoxon} signed rank test, p {\textless} 10(-4) for both indices). The

	Abstract = {{PURPOSE}

The {CyberKnife} uses an online prediction model to improve radiation delivery when treating lung tumors. This study evaluates the prediction model used by the {CyberKnife} radiation therapy system in terms of treatment margins about the gross tumor volume {(GTV).}


{METHODS}

From the data log files produced by the {CyberKnife} synchrony model, the uncertainty in radiation delivery can be calculated. Modeler points indicate the tracked position of the tumor and Predictor points predict the position about 115 ms in the future. The discrepancy between Predictor points and their corresponding Modeler points was analyzed for 100 treatment model data sets from 23 de-identified lung patients. The treatment margins were determined in each anatomic direction to cover an arbitrary volume of the {GTV}, derived from the Modeler points, when the radiation is targeted at the Predictor points. Each treatment model had about 30 min of motion data, of which about 10 min constituted treatment time; only these 10 min were used in the analysis. The frequencies of margin sizes were analyzed and truncated Gaussian normal functions were fit to each direction's distribution. The standard deviation of each Gaussian distribution was then used to describe the necessary margin expansions in each signed 
dimension in order to achieve the desired coverage. In this study, 95\% modeler point coverage was compared to 99\% modeler coverage. Two other error sources were investigated: the correlation error and the targeting error. These were added to the prediction error to give an aggregate error for the {CyberKnife} during treatment of lung tumors.


{RESULTS}

Considering the magnitude of 2sigma from the mean of the Gaussian in each signed dimension, the margin expansions needed for 95\% modeler point coverage were 1.2 mm in the lateral {(LAT)} direction and 1.7 mm in the anterior-posterior {(AP)} direction. For the superior-inferior {(SI)} direction, the fit was poor; but empirically, the expansions were 3.5 mm. For 99\% modeler point coverage, the {AP} margin was 3.6 mm and the lateral margin was 2.9 mm. The {SI} margins for 99\% modeler point coverage were highly variable. The aggregate error at 95\% was 6.9 mm in the {SI} direction, 4.6 mm in the {AP} direction, and 3.5 in the lateral direction.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The Predictor points follow the Modeler points closely. Margins were found in each clinical direction that would provide 95\% modeler point coverage for 95\% of the models reviewed in this study. Similar margins were found in two clinical directions for 99\% modeler point coverage in 95\% of models. These results can offer guidance in the selection of {CTV} margins for treatment with the {CyberKnife.}},

@article{Ren2007,
	Abstract = {One potential application of image-guided radiotherapy is to track the target motion in real time, then deliver adaptive treatment to a dynamic target by {dMLC} tracking or respiratory gating. However, the existence of a finite time delay (or a system latency) between the image acquisition and the response of the treatment system to a change in tumour position implies that some kind of predictive ability should be included in the real-time dynamic target treatment. If diagnostic x-ray imaging is used for the tracking, the dose given over a whole image-guided radiotherapy course can be significant. Therefore, the x-ray beam used for motion tracking should be triggered at a relatively slow pulse frequency, and an interpolation between predictions can be used to provide a fast tracking rate. This study evaluates the performance of an autoregressive-moving average {(ARMA)} model based prediction algorithm for reducing tumour localization error due to system latency and slow imaging rate. For this 
study, we use {3D} motion data from ten lung tumour cases where the peak-to-peak motion is greater than 8 mm. Some strongly irregular traces with variation in amplitude and phase were included. To evaluate the prediction accuracy, the standard deviations between predicted and actual motion position are computed for three system latencies (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 s) at several imaging rates (1.25-10 Hz), and compared against the situation of no prediction. The simulation results indicate that the implementation of the prediction algorithm in real-time target tracking can improve the localization precision for all latencies and imaging rates evaluated. From a common initial setting of model parameters, the predictor can quickly provide an accurate prediction of the position after collecting 20 initial data points. In this retrospective analysis, we calculate the standard deviation of the predicted position from the twentieth position data to the end of the session at 0.1 s interval. For both regular and irregular 
lung tumour motions, with prediction the range of average errors is 0.4-2.5 mm in the {SI} direction from shorter to longer latency, corresponding to a range of 0.8-4.3 mm without prediction; for the {AP} direction a range of 0.3-1.6 mm is obtained with prediction, corresponding to a range of 0.6-3.0 mm without prediction. For 0.2 s and 0.4 s system latency, with prediction the localization based on a relatively slow imaging rate (2.5 Hz) can achieve a better or similar precision compared with no prediction but on a fast imaging rate (10 Hz). This means that precise localization can be realized at a slow imaging rate. This is important for the application of {kV} x-ray imaging systems and {EPID-based} systems in image-guided radiotherapy. In conclusion, the adaptive predictor can successfully predict irregular respiratory motion, and the adaptive prediction of respiration motion can effectively improve the delivery precision of real-time motion compensation radiotherapy.},

	Abstract = {Image guidance in radiotherapy and extracranial radiosurgery offers the potential for precise radiation dose delivery to a moving tumour. Recent work has demonstrated how to locate and track the position of a tumour in real-time using diagnostic x-ray imaging to find implanted radio-opaque markers. However, the delivery of a treatment plan through gating or beam tracking requires adequate consideration of treatment system latencies, including image acquisition, image processing, communication delays, control system processing, inductance within the motor, mechanical damping, etc. Furthermore, the imaging dose given over long radiosurgery procedures or multiple radiotherapy fractions may not be insignificant, which means that we must reduce the sampling rate of the imaging system. This study evaluates various predictive models for reducing tumour localization errors when a real-time tumour-tracking system targets a moving tumour at a slow imaging rate and with large system latencies. We consider 
14 lung tumour cases where the peak-to-peak motion is greater than 8 mm, and compare the localization error using linear prediction, neural network prediction and Kalman filtering, against a system which uses no prediction. To evaluate prediction accuracy for use in beam tracking, we compute the root mean squared error between predicted and actual {3D} motion. We found that by using prediction, root mean squared error is improved for all latencies and all imaging rates evaluated. To evaluate prediction accuracy for use in gated treatment, we present a new metric that compares a gating control signal based on predicted motion against the best possible gating control signal. We found that using prediction improves gated treatment accuracy for systems that have latencies of 200 ms or greater, and for systems that have imaging rates of 10 Hz or slower.},

Early studies have demonstrated that this technique could significantly improve the therapeutic ratio by safely reducing the large target margin that has to be used in conventional radiotherapy for prostate cancer treatment. Clinical application of off-line image-guided adaptive radiotherapy for prostate cancer has demonstrated encouraging clinical outcome. Long-term clinical follow-up has shown significant improvement in terms of tumor control and low toxicity profile, emphasizing the beneficial effect of image-guidance and adaptive treatment. Continuous development in adaptive radiotherapy has made possible additional increases in target dose by further reducing target margin when using online image-guided adaptive intensity-modulated radiation therapy.

	Abstract = {{PURPOSE}

To investigate in a three-dimensional framework the effectiveness and reproducibility of reducing the respiratory motion of liver tumors using abdominal compression in a stereotactic body frame.


{METHODS} {AND} {MATERIALS}

A total of 12 patients with liver tumors, who were treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy, were included in this study. These patients had three gold fiducial markers implanted in the healthy liver tissue surrounding the tumor. Fluoroscopic videos were acquired on the planning day and before each treatment fraction to visualize the motion of the fiducial markers during free breathing and varying levels of abdominal compression. Software was developed to track the fiducial markers and measure their excursions.


{RESULTS}

Abdominal compression reduced the patient group median excursion by 62\% in the craniocaudal and 38\% in the anteroposterior direction with respect to the median free-breathing excursions. In the left-right direction, the median excursion increased 15\% (maximal increase 1.6 mm). The median residual excursion was 4.1 mm in the craniocaudal, 2.4 mm in the anteroposterior, and 1.8 mm in the left-right direction. The mean excursions were reduced by compression to {\textless}5 mm in all patients and all directions, with two exceptions (craniocaudal excursion reduction of 20.5 mm to 7.4 mm and of 21.1 mm to 5.9 mm). The residual excursions reproduced well during the treatment course, and the craniocaudal excursions measured on the treatment days were never significantly (alpha = 0.05) greater than on the planning days. Fine tuning the compression did not considerably change the excursion on the treatment days.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Abdominal compression effectively reduced liver tumor motion, yielding small and reproducible excursions in three dimensions. The compression level established at planning could have been safely used on the treatment days.},

@article{Eccles2011,
	Abstract = {Purpose
Abdominal compression {(AC)} can be used to reduce respiratory liver motion in patients undergoing liver stereotactic body radiotherapy. The purpose of the present study was to measure the changes in three-dimensional liver tumor motion with and without compression using cine-magnetic resonance imaging.
Patients and Methods
A total of 60 patients treated as a part of an institutional research ethics board-approved liver stereotactic body radiotherapy protocol underwent cine T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging through the tumor centroid in the coronal and sagittal planes. A total of 240 cine-magnetic resonance imaging sequences acquired at one to three images each second for 30--60 s were evaluated using an in-house--developed template matching tool (based on the coefficient correlation) to measure the magnitude of the tumor motion. The average tumor edge displacements were used to determine the magnitude of changes in the caudal--cranial {(CC)} and anteroposterior {(AP)} directions, with and without {AC.}
Results
The mean tumor motion without {AC} of 11.7 mm (range, 4.8--23.3) in the {CC} direction was reduced to 9.4 mm (range, 1.6--23.4) with {AC.} The tumor motion was reduced in both directions {(CC} and {AP)} in 52\% of the patients and in a single direction {(CC} or {AP)} in 90\% of the patients. The mean decrease in tumor motion with {AC} was 2.3 and 0.6 mm in the {CC} and {AP} direction, respectively. Increased motion occurred in one or more directions in 28\% of patients. Clinically significant (\&gt;3 mm) decreases were observed in 40\% and increases in \&lt;2\% of patients in the {CC} direction.
Conclusion
{AC} can significantly reduce three-dimensional liver tumor motion in most patients, although the magnitude of the reduction was smaller than previously reported.},

	Abstract = {The most advanced delivery technique for proton radiotherapy is active spot scanning. So far, predominantly static targets have been treated with active spot scanning, since mobile targets in combination with dynamic treatment delivery can lead to interplay effects, causing inhomogeneous dose distributions. One way to mitigate motion effects is re-scanning. In this study we investigate the effectiveness of re-scanning in relation to different plan parameters (number of fields, field directions, number of re-scans) as well as in respect to different motion parameters (motion amplitude, motion starting phase). A systematic study was performed for three liver patients, for which ten different plans have been calculated, respectively. The treatment plans were evaluated for three different scenarios (static, motion/single-scan-delivery, motion/re-scanned-delivery). The choice of motion parameters was based on an evaluation of the {4D} {CT} data sets of the three patients. It is shown that the effect 
of motion/re-scanning per fraction is largest the fewer fields per plan are used and the more the field direction differs from the main motion direction. For amplitudes up to 6 mm, re-scanning may not be required if multiple fields are used, since only dose blurring effects appear that cannot be compensated by re-scanning. For larger motion amplitudes two planning strategies are proposed.},

	Abstract = {In treatment of motion affected tumours by means of a scanned particle beam severe under and
over dosage can occur due to the interplay effect. By using gated beam delivery effective target
motion is reduced, but even for the residual motion the interplay effect can lead to unsatisfactory
dose distributions. Furthermore, an appropriate motion monitoring system is essential since
beam delivery has to be synchronized to target motion.
In this work three aspects were investigated to move gating closer towards clinical operation
at Heidelberg {Ion-Beam} Therapy Center {(HIT):} Firstly, influences of beam parameters on
dosimetric effects of residual motion were investigated in experiments and simulations. Increased
focus sizes and reduced iso-energy distances turned out to be an effective method
to gain dose homogeneity whereas reduction of lateral beam position spacing did not show
such an effect. Secondly, to enable systematic studies of mitigation techniques and effects of
miscorrelation between motion monitoring system and tumour motion a phantom with {6D} target
and independent thorax motion was constructed and validated successfully in experiments.
Thirdly, two motion monitoring systems by {VisionRT} Ltd. and Anzai Medical {Co.,Ltd.}, respectively,
were compared in terms of gating delays and correlation to tumour motion extracted
from {MV-fluoroscopy.} While the {VisionRT} system showed larger delays than the Anzai system
under laboratory conditions, no significant difference between the systems with respect to
tumour-correlation was found in a clinical study.
Results of this work will be incorporated into patient treatments using gating that will start at
{HIT} within the next few months. Furthermore, a phantom simulating thorax and target motion
with a variety of applications such as {4D} imaging is now available and already in use by several
groups.},

	Abstract = {We present a critical analysis of the conformity indices described in the literature and an evaluation of their field of application. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, with or without intensity modulation, is based on medical imaging techniques, three-dimensional dosimetry software, compression accessories, and verification procedures. It consists of delineating target volumes and critical healthy tissues to select the best combination of beams. This approach allows better adaptation of the isodose to the tumor volume, while limiting irradiation of healthy tissues. Tools must be developed to evaluate the quality of proposed treatment plans. Dosimetry software provides the dose distribution in each {CT} section and dose-volume histograms without really indicating the degree of conformity. The conformity index is a complementary tool that attributes a score to a treatment plan or that can compare several treatment plans for the same patient. The future of conformal index in everyday 
practice therefore remains unclear.},

	Abstract = {{PURPOSE}

This article presents a method of quantitative assessment of the degree of conformality and its designation by a single numerical value.


{METHODS} {AND} {MATERIALS}

A conformation number is introduced to evaluate objectively the degree of conformality. A comparison is made between the conformation number as found for external beam treatment plans and ultrasonically guided {125I} seed implants for localized prostate cancer.


{RESULTS}

The conformation number in case of a planning target volume irradiated with two opposed open beams, three open beams, and three beams with customized blocks amounted to 0.17, 0.39, and 0.65, respectively. The conformation number as found for ultrasonically guided permanent prostate implants using {125I} seeds averaged 0.72.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The conformation number is a convenient instrument for indicating the degree of conformality by a single numerical value. Treatments with a conformation number greater than 0.60 might be termed conformal radiotherapy.},

@article{Fowler1989,
	Abstract = {Excerpt
Clinical gains have been reported from the use of nonstandard fractionation schedules planned with a radiobiological basis. Hyperfractionation provides the leading example, as described below, with accelerated fractionation being developed more recently. Although examples of almost every kind of fractionated schedule can be found in the literature over the past 90 years, it is only within the last decade that the biological factors concerning overall time and delayed proliferation after irradiation, and the effect of dose per fraction, have been understood. Both these factors operate differently on late- and early-reacting tissues, because cell proliferation in late-reacting tissues is slow or absent, but early reacting tissues and tumours depend upon cells that proliferate rapidly. This basic knowledge is still diffusing through the radiotherapy community and I hope this review will help the diffusion process. The biological factors concerning fractionation seem to apply to the majority of tissues and 
tumours, so that new schedules can be planned that are effective in practice.
Attempts to deal with hypoxic cells in tumours or to use high-linear-energy-transfer {(LET)} radiation have been less generally successful, probably because in those strategies we need to identify subpopulations that are smaller. Tumours that are resistant to conventional radiotherapy because they contain hypoxic cells and do not reoxygenate cannot be identifed yet.},

@article{Skinner2011,
	Abstract = {Historically, the use of external-beam radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma {(HCC)} has been limited by toxicity to the uninvolved liver and surrounding structures. Advances in photon radiotherapy have improved dose conformality to the tumor and facilitated dose escalation, a key contributor to improved {HCC} radiation treatment outcomes. However, despite these advances in photon radiotherapy, significant volumes of liver still receive low doses of radiation that can preclude dose escalation, particularly in patients with limited functional liver reserves. By capitalizing on the lack of exit dose along the beam path beyond the tumor and higher biological effectiveness, charged-particle therapy offers the promise of maximizing tumor control via dose escalation without excessive liver toxicity. In this review, we discuss the distinctive biophysical attributes of both proton and carbon ion radiotherapy, particularly as they pertain to treatment of {HCC.} We also review the available literature 
regarding clinical outcomes and the toxicity of using charged particles for the treatment of {HCC.}},

@article{Seong2003,
	Abstract = {{PURPOSE}

To analyze the treatment results and prognostic factors affecting survival in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treated with local radiotherapy {(RT).}


{METHODS} {AND} {MATERIALS}

Between 1992 and 2000, 158 patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma received local {RT.} Sixty-seven patients had an advanced {UICC} Stage {III} lesion and 91 patients had Stage {IVA.} The mean tumor size was 9.0 +/- 3.0 cm, and liver cirrhosis was present in 142 patients. Local {RT} was combined with transarterial chemoembolization as primary treatment (107 patients) or as salvage after failure of repeated transarterial chemoembolization (51 patients). The mean radiation dose was 48.2 +/- 7.9 Gy in daily {1.8-Gy} fractions.


{RESULTS}

The mean follow-up was 21.6 months after diagnosis and 14.6 months after {RT.} The response rate was 67.1\%. The overall survival rate at 2 and 5 years was 30.5\% and 9\%, respectively, from the time of diagnosis (median survival time 16 months) and 19.9\% and 4.7\%, respectively, after {RT} (median survival time 10 months). On univariate analysis, tumor size (p = 0.047), the presence of portal vein thrombosis (p = 0.007), and {RT} dose (p = 0.001) were significant factors for survival. However, on multivariate analysis, {RT} dose was the only significant factor (p = 0.01).


{CONCLUSION}

Local {RT} achieved substantial tumor regression and survival. The radiation dose was found to be a significant prognostic factor in the {RT} of hepatocellular carcinoma. Additional efforts for dose escalation are warranted to improve the treatment results in parallel with better protecting the nontumorous liver.},

@article{Dawson2000,
	Abstract = {{PURPOSE}

To evaluate the response, time to progression, survival, and impact of radiation {(RT)} dose on survival in patients with intrahepatic malignancies treated on a phase I trial of escalated focal liver {RT.}


{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS}

From April 1996 to January 1998, 43 patients with unresectable intrahepatic hepatobiliary cancer {(HB;} 27 patients) and colorectal liver metastases {(LM;} 16 patients) were treated with high-dose conformal {RT.} The median tumor size was 10 x 10 x 8 cm. The median {RT} dose was 58.5 Gy (range, 28.5 to 90 Gy), 1.5 Gy twice daily, with concurrent continuous-infusion hepatic arterial fluorodeoxyuridine (0.2 mg/kg/d) during the first 4 weeks of {RT.}


{RESULTS}

The response rate in 25 assessable patients was 68\% (16 partial and one complete response). With a median potential follow-up period of 26.5 months, the median times to progression for all tumors, {LM}, and {HB} were 6, 8, and 3 months, respectively. The median survival times of all patients, patients with {LM}, and patients with {HB} were 16, 18, and 11 months, respectively. On multivariate analyses, escalated {RT} dose was independently associated with improved progression-free and overall survival. The median survival of patients treated with 70 Gy or more has not yet been reached (16.4+ months), compared with 11.6 months in patients treated with lower {RT} doses {(P} =.0003).


{CONCLUSION}

The excellent response rate, prolonged intrahepatic control, and improved survival in patients treated with {RT} doses of 70 Gy or more motivate continuation of dose-escalation studies for patients with intrahepatic malignancies.},
