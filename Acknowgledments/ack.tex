\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I wish to start by thanking my advisor Christian Graeff for his guidance, patience and extensive help throughout the years. Christoph Bert for first giving me the opportunity to come to GSI and start with the research of this fascinating field. And Marco Durante for taking me under his wing, for his mentorship and invaluable advice.  

My PhD (Thesis?) would not be the same without the things I have learned and the work I was able to do at the Champalimaud Center for The Unknown in Lisbon. I would like to thank the entire staff of the Oncology Department, especially Sandra Vierra, who welcomed me with open hands and made my time spent there an unforgettable experience. A thank you to Joep Stroom for relentlessly replying to my e-mails, preping the patients and showing me around the Champalimaund Center. Nuno Pimentel for helping me out with his medical expertise. And Carlo Greco for the collaboration and the opportunity to be a part of the  Oncology Department of Champalimaud Center for The Unknow.

Thank you to everyone in our work group and the entire Biophysics department for treating me as one of their own and helping me feel at home at GSI. A special thank you to Till Dettmering for being a first friend I have made in Darmstadt and helping me settle into new environments, both GSI and Germany.  Daniel Richter and Sebastian Hild, thank you for your help in programing. Anna Einchorn for the help with registrations and reading my Thesis. And Matthias Prall for the translations. 

Last but not least, my family. Thank you mami & ati for helping me get here. I would not have made it without your help and unconditional support.
