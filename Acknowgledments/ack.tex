\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to extend my sincerest thanks to everybody, who helped me on my journey to completing my PhD.
I wish to start by thanking my advisor Christian Graeff for his guidance, patience and extensive help throughout the years. 
Christoph Bert for first giving me the opportunity to come to GSI and start with the research of this fascinating field. And Marco Durante for taking me under his wing, for his mentorship and invaluable advice.  

Anna Eichhorn for the fruitful discussions and for thoroughly reading through my thesis. Matthias Prall for the vital corrections and your help in last, but crucial moments. Daniel Richter and Sebastian Hild, thank you for your help with programing.
A special thank you to Till Dettmering for being a first friend I have made in Germany and helping me settle into new environments, both GSI and Germany. 
Marta Rovituso for the advice on how to actually deliver the thesis. Tobias Brandt and Jens Woelfelschneider from UK Erlangen for their involvement in DIRQA module development.
Thank you to everyone in our work group and the entire Biophysics department for treating me as one of your own and helping me feel at home at GSI. 

This thesis would not be the same without the things I have learned and the work I was able to do at the Champalimaud Center for The Unknown in Lisbon.
A very special thank you to Joep Stroom for relentlessly replying to my e-mails, preparing the patient data and showing me around the Champalimaund Center.
I would like to thank the entire staff of the Oncology Department, especially Sandra Vierra, who welcomed me with open hands and made my time spent there an unforgettable experience. 
Nuno Pimentel for helping me out with his medical expertise. And Carlo Greco for the collaboration and the opportunity to be a part of the Oncology Department of Champalimaud Center for The Unknown.

Special thanks to my family. Thank you parents for helping me get here. I would not have made it without your help and unconditional support. Writing my thesis was much easier with my brother keeping me up in good spirits
and being a good support.

And the biggest thank you definitely goes to the two girls who bring the most joy in my life. 
My daughter tried to wait patiently for me to finish writing, sometimes failing, but always making me laugh.
There is not enough place here to express my gratitude to my wife Vanja. Not only did she help me pursue my dreams by moving with me to Germany, she stood by me and was my lighthouse when I was lost.
