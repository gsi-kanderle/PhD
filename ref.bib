The results that showed a strong correlation (0.77\{+/-\}0.12) between the patients' skin and tumour movement, especially for the sites located in the lower lung fields or in the diaphragm. With the prediction from skin motion, the uncertainties of the position of tumours due to respiratory movement could be reduced by up to 1.47 cm in the lower lung fields in the superior-inferior (SI) direction.

abstract="Ability of online adaptive replanning is desirable to correct for interfraction anatomic changes. A full-scope replanning/reoptimization with the current planning techniques takes too long to be practical. A novel online replanning strategy to correct for interfraction anatomic changes in real time is presented. The scheme consists of three steps: (1) rapidly delineating targets and organs at risk on the computed tomography of the day by modifying original planning contours using robust tools in a semiautomatic manner, (2) online segment aperture morphing (SAM) (adjusting beam/ segment apertures) by applying the spatial relationship between the planning target contour and the apertures to the new target contour, and (3) performing segment weight optimization (SWO) for the new apertures if necessary. The entire scheme was tested for direct-aperture-based IMRT on representative prostate and abdomen cases. Dose volume histograms obtained with the online scheme are practically equivalent to those obtained with full-scope reoptimization. For the days of small to moderate organ deformations, only the SAM is necessary, while for the large deformation days, both SAM and SWO are required to adequately account for the deformation. Both the SAM and SWO programs can be completed within 1 min, and the overall process can be completed within 10 min. The proposed SAM-SWO scheme is practically comparable to full-scope reoptimization, but is fast enough to be implemented for on-line adaptive replanning, enabling dose-guided RT",

abstract="PURPOSE: To report the application of an adaptive replanning technique for prostate cancer radiotherapy (RT), consisting of two steps: (1) segment aperture morphing (SAM), and (2) segment weight optimization (SWO), to account for interfraction variations. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The new ``SAM+SWO'' scheme was retroactively applied to the daily CT images acquired for 10 prostate cancer patients on a linear accelerator and CT-on-Rails combination during the course of RT. Doses generated by the SAM+SWO scheme based on the daily CT images were compared with doses generated after patient repositioning using the current planning target volume (PTV) margin (5 mm, 3 mm toward rectum) and a reduced margin (2 mm), along with full reoptimization scans based on the daily CT images to evaluate dosimetry benefits. RESULTS: For all cases studied, the online replanning method provided significantly better target coverage when compared with repositioning with reduced PTV (13\% increase in minimum prostate dose) and improved organ sparing when compared with repositioning with regular PTV (13\% decrease in the generalized equivalent uniform dose of rectum). The time required to complete the online replanning process was 6 +/- 2 minutes. CONCLUSION: The proposed online replanning method can be used to account for interfraction variations for prostate RT with a practically acceptable time frame (5-10 min) and with significant dosimetric benefits. On the basis of this study, the developed online replanning scheme is being implemented in the clinic for prostate RT",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Heavy ion beams possess high linear energy transfer components and a prominent Bragg peak in the human body, resulting in higher relative biological effectiveness and improved dose distribution. To establish heavy ion therapy techniques for the treatment of prostate cancer, phase I/II clinical trials were initiated. METHODS: For 96 patients with T1b-T3 prostate cancer, three carbon ion beams were used to irradiate the prostate and seminal vesicles (20 times/5 weeks) with or without endocrine therapy. Radiation dose was expressed in GyE which was initially thought to be equivalent to photon dose. Total dose was gradually increased from 54 to 72 GyE. RESULTS: Carbon ion therapy was completed in 20 cases of T1b/T1c/T2aN0M0 as monotherapy, in 8 cases of T2b/T3pN0M0 with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, and in 68 cases of T2b/T3N0/pN1M0 with neoadjuvant and adjuvant endocrine therapy. Median observation period was 47 months. Grade 3 late radiation morbidity of rectum and/or bladder/urethra developed in one and five cases who received 66 and 72 GyE of radiation, respectively. After these adverse effects were observed, total dose was decreased to 66 GyE and the radiation field was coned down during the treatment course. At 5 years, overall, cause-specific, clinical recurrence-free, and biochemical recurrence-free survival rates were 87.7, 94.9, 90.0, and 82.6\%, respectively. Local control was achieved in all patients except one patient who received 54 GyE of radiation. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic techniques of carbon ion therapy have been established for patients with prostate cancer. Carbon ion therapy may exert excellent effect to the tissues of prostate cancer",

abstract="We present treatment planning methods based on four-dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT) to incorporate tumour motion using (1) a static field and (2) a dynamic field. Static 4D fields are determined to include the target in all breathing phases, whereas dynamic 4D fields are determined to follow the shape of the tumour assessed from 4D-CT images with a dynamic weighting factor. The weighting factor selection depends on the reliability of patient breathing and limitations of the delivery system. The static 4D method is compared with our standard protocol for gross tumour volume (GTV) coverage, mean lung dose and V20. It was found that the GTV delineated on helical CT without incorporating breathing motion does not adequately represent the target compared to the GTV delineated from 4D-CT. Dosimetric analysis indicates that the static 4D-CT based technique results in a reduction of the mean lung dose compared with the standard protocol. Measurements on a moving phantom and simulations indicated that 4D radiotherapy (4D-RT) synchronized with respiration-induced motion further reduces mean lung dose and V20, and may allow safe application of dose escalation and CRT/IMRT. The motions of the chest cavity, tumour and thoracic structures of 24 lung cancer patients are also analysed",

abstract="PURPOSE: A retrospective study to investigate the sensitivity of intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) to changes in body weight occurring during the course of radiotherapy for patients treated in the sacral region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During therapy, important weight gain and loss were observed for two patients treated to para-spinal tumors, which resulted in both patients being re-scanned and re-planned. Both patients were treated as part of their therapy, with a narrow-angle IMPT (NA-IMPT) plan delivering a 'dose hole' around the cauda equina (CE), which was mainly formed through modulation of Bragg peaks in depth. To investigate the impact of these weight changes on the proton range and delivered dose, the nominal fields were re-calculated on the new CT data sets. Results were analyzed by comparing these new plans with those originally delivered and by calculating changes in range and delivered doses in target volumes and normal tissues. RESULTS: Maximum differences in proton range in the CE region of up to +8 mm and -13 mm, respectively, for the patient who gained weight and for the patient who lost weight, increased the maximum dose to the CE by only 2\%. This indicates that both IMPT plans were relatively insensitive to substantial range uncertainties. Even greater differences in range (16 mm) in the planning target volume only slightly affected its dose homogeneity (differences in V(90\%) of 6\% in the worst case). Nevertheless, some large undesired local dose differences were observed. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated, that, at least for the two analyzed cases, NA-IMPT plans are less sensitive to weight variations than one may expect. Still, we would advise to calculate new plans in case of substantial change in weight for patients treated in the sacral region, primarily due to the presence of new hot/cold area",

abstract="PURPOSE: In prostatic cancer, the prostate cannot be discerned from a portal image. Setup information is, therefore, obtained from bony anatomy. To perform high-precision conformal therapy, knowledge about the variation in distance between the prostate and adjacent bony anatomy during an external radiotherapy treatment is mandatory. This report is concerned with that variation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nine patients previously treated interstitially for prostatic cancer with implantation of 125I seeds, agreed to cooperate in a study. They underwent a number of simulations of external radiotherapy treatment. After the first patient setup, this setup was repeated five times for each patient as if the patient was treated by external radiotherapy. Simulator radiographs were made from each setup in the anterior-posterior and left-right lateral directions. The seeds were clearly visible in the simulator film images and reflect the position of the prostate. No bladder instructions were given and the filling of the rectum was not quantified. RESULTS: Variation in distance between the prostate and the bony anatomy was measured and is presented in one standard deviation of the normal distribution function: 0.8 mm lateral, 1.5 mm ventrodorsal, and 1.7 mm craniocaudal.

abstract="This paper reviews the European activities in the field of tumour therapy with beams which have a Radio Biological Effectiveness (RBE) larger than 1. Initially neutron beams have been used. Then charged pions promised better cure rates so that their use was pursued in the framework of the ;Piotron' project at the Paul Scherrer Institute (Switzerland). However both approaches did not meet the expectations and in the 80s the EULIMA project became the flagship of these attempts to improve the effects of the delivery of radiation doses of large RBE with respect to photons, electrons and even protons. The EULIMA ion accelerator was never built and it took more than ten years to see the approval, in Heidelberg and Pavia, of the construction of the HIT and CNAO ;dual' centres for carbon ions and protons. In 2008 they will start treating patients. The developments that brought to these construction projects are described together with the special features of these two facilities. The third European dual centre is being built by Siemens Medical Systems in Marburg, Germany, while other facilities have been approved but not yet fully financed in Wiener Neustadt (Austria), Lyon (France) and Uppsala (Sweden). Finally the collaboration activities of the European Network ENLIGHT are presented together with the recent involvements of European industries in the construction of turn-key dual centres and the development of a new accelerator concept for hadrontherapy, the ;cyclinac'",

abstract="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To use radiobiological modelling to estimate the number of initial days of treatment imaging required to gain most of the benefit from off-line correction of systematic errors in the conformal radiation therapy of prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Treatment plans based on the anatomical information of a representative patient were generated assuming that the patient is treated with a multi leaf collimator (MLC) four-field technique and a total isocentre dose of 72 Gy delivered in 36 daily fractions. Target position variations between fractions were simulated from standard deviations of measured data found in the literature. Off-line correction of systematic errors was assumed to be performed only once based on the measured errors during the initial days of treatment. The tumour control probability (TCP) was calculated using the Webb and Nahum model. RESULTS: Simulation of daily variations in the target position predicted a marked reduction in TCP if the planning target volume (PTV) margin was smaller than 4 mm (TCP decreased by 3.4\% for 2 mm margin). The systematic components of target position variations had greater effect on the TCP than the random components. Off-line correction of estimated systematic errors reduced the decrease in TCP due to target daily displacements, nevertheless, the resulting TCP levels for small margins were still less than the TCP level obtained with the use of an adequate PTV margin of approximately 10 mm. The magnitude of gain in TCP expected from the correction depended on the number of treatment imaging days used for the correction and the PTV margin applied. Gains of 2.5\% in TCP were estimated from correction of systematic errors performed after 6 initial days of treatment imaging for a 2 mm PTV margin. The effect of various possible magnitudes of systematic and random components on the gain in TCP expected from correction and on the number of imaging days required was also investigated. CONCLUSIONS: Daily variations of target position markedly reduced the TCP if small margins were used. Off-line correction of systematic errors can only partly compensate for these TCP reductions. The adequate number of treatment imaging days required for systematic error correction depends on the magnitude of the random component compared with the systematic component, and on the size of PTV margin used. For random components equal to or smaller than the systematic component, 3 consecutive treatment imaging days are estimated to be sufficient to gain most of the benefit from correction for current clinically used margins (6-10 mm); otherwise more days are required",

abstract="A previous study from our laboratory has shown that a single targeted heavy ion irradiation (THIR; 15 Gy) to rabbit hearts increases connexin43 (Cx43) expression for 2 wk in association with an improvement of conduction, a decrease of the spatial inhomogeneity of repolarization, and a reduction of vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. This study investigated the time- and dose-dependent effects of THIR (5-15 Gy) on Cx43 expression in normal rabbit hearts (n = 45). Five rabbits without THIR were used as controls. A significant upregulation of Cx43 protein and mRNA in the ventricular myocardium was recognized by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and real-time PCR from 2 wk up to 1 yr after a single THIR at 15 Gy. THIR > or =10 Gy caused a significant dose-dependent increase of Cx43 protein and mRNA 2 wk after THIR. Anterior, lateral, and posterior free wall of the left ventricle, interventricular septum, and right ventricular free wall were affected similarly by THIR in terms of Cx43 upregulation. The radiation-induced increase of immunolabeled Cx43 was observed not only at the intercalated disk region but also at the lateral surface of ventricular myocytes. The increase of immunoreactive Cx43 protein was predominant in the membrane fraction insoluble in Triton X-100, that is the Cx43 in the sarcolemma. In vivo examinations of the rabbits 1 yr after THIR (15 Gy) revealed no significant changes in ECGs and echocardiograms (left ventricular dimensions, contractility, and diastolic function), indicating no apparent late radiation injury. A single application of THIR causes upregulation and altered cellular distribution of Cx43 in the ventricles lasting for at least 1 yr. This long-lasting remodeling effect on gap junctions may open the pathway to novel therapy against life threatening ventricular arrhythmias in structural heart disease",

abstract="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Scanned-beam interplay with the intrafraction target motion may result in dose deterioration in particle therapy. The magnitude of this effect and the possibilities to mitigate it were investigated for carbon ion prostate treatments. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For 12 prostate cases, 9 carbon ion treatment plans were prepared using 3 scanned-beam settings (spot sizes of 6, 7 and 9 mm and, respectively, raster pitches of 2, 2 and 3 mm) for 3 planning margins (3, 6 and 9 mm). Plans were recomputed in presence of 5 intrafraction prostate motion scenarios with and without intra-beam motion compensation. RESULTS: For 6 mm margin and 7 mm spot, the median (max) CTV D(95\%) change was -0.2 (-2.6) pp (percentual points) with pure drift motion, -3.8 (-6.0) pp and -2.8 (-3.1) pp in transient motion scenarios and -4.8 (-7.7) pp and -1.8 (-5.7) pp in mixed motion scenarios. No particular raster setting brought distinct advantage, while planning margin expansion showed statistically significant effects for drift-dominated scenarios. Intra-beam motion compensation yielded improved CTV coverage. CONCLUSION: Intrafraction prostate motion can lead to marked target coverage deterioration, dependent on individual motion patterns, which can be only partially avoided through planning-time countermeasures. Among possible delivery-time countermeasures, intra-beam motion compensation is capable of improving target coverage",

abstract="PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to measure the mobility of the clinical target volume (CTV) in prostate radiotherapy with respect to the pelvic anatomy during a course of therapy. These data are needed to properly design the planning target volume (PTV). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Seventeen patients were studied. Each patient underwent computed tomography (CT) scanning for treatment planning purposes. Subsequently, three CT scans were obtained at approximately 2-week intervals during treatment. The prostate, seminal vesicles, bladder, and rectum were outlined on each CT study. The second through the fourth CT studies were aligned with the first study using a rigid body transformation based on the bony anatomy. The transformation was used to compute the center of mass position and bounding box of each organ in the subsequent studies relative to the first study. Differences in the bounding box limits and center of mass positions between the first and subsequent studies were tabulated and correlated with bladder and rectal volume and positional parameters. RESULTS: The mobility of the CTV was characterized by standard deviations of 0.09 cm (left-right), 0.36 cm (cranial-caudal), and 0.41cm (anterior-posterior). Prostate mobility was not significantly correlated with bladder volume. However, the mobility of both the prostate and seminal vesicles was very significantly correlated with rectal volume. Bladder and rectal volumes decreased between the pretreatment CT scan and the first on-treatment CT scan, but were constant for all on-treatment CT scans. CONCLUSION: Margins between the CTV and PTV based on the simple geometric requirement that a point on the edge of the CTV is enclosed by the PTV 95\% of the time are 0.7 cm in the lateral and cranial-caudal directions, and 1.1 cm in the anterior-posterior direction. However, minimum dose to the CTV and avoidance of organs at risk are more important considerations when drawing beam apertures. More consistent methods for reproducing prostate position (e.g., empty rectum) and more sophisticated beam aperture optimization are needed to guarantee consistent coverage of the CTV while avoiding organs at risk",

To this purpose the new proton and light-ion radiation therapy facilities must be designed according to strict clinical specifications to provide a reliable and effective tool against cancer. This paper provides the performance specifications of the accelerator and of the beam transport and delivery systems of the Italian Hadrontherapy Centre, which should be satisfied to meet the clinical specifications. A discussion is given on the requirements on energy range, energy variability, beam intensity, lateral penumbra, distal dose falloff, source-to-surface distance, time structure of the extracted beam, raster scanning system specifications, and beam abort time. Though the physical specifications are given for a particular accelerator, they can be used as a general guideline for the design of future biomedical particle accelerator facilities",

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate effectiveness and safety of spot-scanning-based proton radiotherapy (PT) in skull-base chordomas and chondrosarcomas. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between October 1998 and November 2005, 64 patients with skull-base chordomas (n = 42) and chondrosarcomas (n = 22) were treated at Paul Scherrer Institute with PT using spot-scanning technique. Median total dose for chordomas was 73.5 Gy(RBE) and 68.4 Gy(RBE) for chondrosarcomas at 1.8-2.0 Gy(RBE) dose per fraction. Local control (LC), disease specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS) rates were calculated. Toxicity was assessed according to CTCAE, v. 3.0. RESULTS: Mean follow-up period was 38 months (range, 14-92 months). Five patients with chordoma and one patient with chondrosarcoma experienced local recurrence. Actuarial 5-year LC rates were 81\% for chordomas and 94\% for chondrosarcomas. Brainstem compression at the time of PT (p = 0.007) and gross tumor volume >25 mL (p = 0.03) were associated with lower LC rates. Five years rates of DSS and OS were 81\% and 62\% for chordomas and 100\% and 91\% for chondrosarcomas, respectively. High-grade late toxicity consisted of one patient with Grade 3 and one patient with Grade 4 unilateral optic neuropathy, and two patients with Grade 3 central nervous system necrosis. No patient experienced brainstem toxicity. Actuarial 5-year freedom from high-grade toxicity was 94\%. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate safety and efficacy of spot-scanning based PT for skull-base chordomas and chondrosarcomas. With target definition, dose prescription and normal organ tolerance levels similar to passive-scattering based PT series, complication-free, tumor control and survival rates are at present comparable",

abstract="AIM: Numerous studies reported the use of ultrasound image-guidance system to assess and correct patient setup during radiotherapy for prostate cancer. We conducted a study to demonstrate and quantify prostate displacement resulting from pressure of the probe on the abdomen during transabdominal ultrasound image acquisition for prostate localization. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers were asked to undergo one imaging procedure. The procedure was performed in a condition that simulates the localization of prostate during online ultrasound guidance. A 3D ultrasound machine was used. The procedure started with the placement of the probe on the abdomen above the pubis symphysis. The probe was tilted in a caudal and posterior direction until the prostate and seminal vesicle were visualized. The probe was then fixed with a rigid arm, which maintained the probe in a static position during image acquisition. The probe was then moved, in a short time, stepwise toward the prostate, acquiring images at each step. The prostate and seminal vesicles were identified and selected in all planes. The first 3D volume was used as reference 1, to which all other scans were matched using a gray value matching algorithm. RESULTS: Prostate motion was quantified as a 3D translation relative to the patient coordinate system. The resulting translations represented the amount of prostate movement as a function of probe displacement. Between 7 and 11 images were obtained per volunteer, with a maximal probe displacement ranging between 3 and 6 cm. Prostate displacement was measured in all volunteers for all the probe steps and in all directions. The largest displacements occurred in the posterior direction in all volunteers. The absolute prostate motion was less than 5 mm in 100\% of the volunteers after 1 cm of probe displacement, in 80\% after 1.5 cm, in 40\% after 2 cm, in 10\% after 2.5 cm, and 0\% after 3 cm. To achieved a good-quality ultrasound images, the probe requires an average displacement of 1.2 cm, and this results in an average prostate displacement of 3.1 mm. No correlations were observed between prostate motion and prostate-probe distance or bladder size. CONCLUSION: Probe pressure during ultrasound image acquisition causes prostate displacement, which is correlated to the amount of probe displacement from initial contact. The induced uncertainty associated with this process needs to be carefully evaluated to determine a safe margin to be employed during online ultrasound image-guided radiotherapy of the prostate",

abstract="A solid heterogeneous phantom made up of 25- and 50-mm cubes of materials with different electron densities was used to verify the accuracy of a three-dimensional (3-D) dose calculation algorithm. This algorithm uses 3-D information obtained from contiguous CT (computed tomography) slices, spaced 5 mm apart. Primary and scatter doses at a point are calculated by using information from ray-tracing CT voxels. The algorithm was developed on a Stardent model 1500 Supergraphic workstation. Cubes of materials with different electron densities were stacked up to simulate finite heterogeneities in three dimensions. This design allows verification of the algorithm for surface contour corrections and finite heterogeneities in the treatment field. Thermoluminescent lithium fluoride chips were placed in grooves milled on the cubes for dose measurement at various points. Different experiments were performed to investigate both the accuracy of the dose calculation algorithm and the utility of the versatile test phantom",

abstract="PURPOSE: The biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS) rate after treatment with permanent iodine-125 seed implantation (PSI) or combined seeds and external beam radiotherapy (COMB) for clinical stage T1-T2 localized prostate cancer is a clinically relevant endpoint. The goal of this work was to evaluate the influence of relevant patient- and treatment-related factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population comprised 312 consecutive patients treated with permanent seed implantation. All patients were evaluable for analysis of overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS), 230 for bRFS, of which 192 were in the PSI group and 38 in the COMB group. The prescribed minimum peripheral dose was 145 Gy for PSI, for COMB 110 Gy implant and external beam radiotherapy of 45 Gy. The median follow-up time was 33 months (range 8-66 months). bRFS was defined as a serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level </= 0.2 ng/ml at last follow-up. RESULTS: Overall, the actuarial bRFS at 50 months was 88.4 \%. The 50-month bRFS rate for PSI and COMB was 90.9 \%, and 77.2 \%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, age in the categories </= 63 and > 63 years (p < 0.00), PSA nadir (</= 0.5 ng/ml and > 0.5 ng{\backslash}ml) and PSA bounce (yes/no) were the significant predicting factors for bRFS. None of the other patient and treatment variables (treatment modality, stage, PSA, Gleason score, risk group, number of risk factors, D90 and various other dose parameters) were found to be a statistically significant predictor of 50-month bRFS. CONCLUSION: The biochemical failure rates were low in this study. As a proof of principle, our large monocenteric analysis shows that low-dose-rate brachytherapy is an effective and safe procedure for patients with early stage prostate cancer",

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate uncertainties associated with treatment-planning computed tomography (CT) data obtained with the patient breathing freely. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with thoracic or abdominal tumors underwent a standard treatment-planning CT study while breathing quietly and freely, followed by CT scans while holding their breath at normal inhalation and normal exhalation. Identical treatment plans on all three CT data sets for each patient pointed out differences in: (a) radiation path lengths; (b) positions of the organs; (c) physical volumes of the lung, liver, and kidneys; (d) the interpretation of plan evaluation tools such as dose-volume histograms and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models; and (e) how well the planning CT data set represented the average of the inhalation and exhalation studies. RESULTS: Inhalation and exhalation data differ in terms of radiation path length (nearly one quarter of the cases had path-length differences > 1 cm), although the free breathing and average path lengths do not exhibit large differences (0-9 mm). Liver and kidney movements averaged 2 cm, whereas differences between the free breathing and average positions averaged 0.6 cm. The physical volume of the liver between the free breathing and static studies varied by as much as 12\%. The NTCP calculations on exhale and inhale studies varied from 3 to 43\% for doses that resulted in a 15\% NTCP on the free-breathing studies. CONCLUSION: Free-breathing CT studies may improperly estimate the position and volume of critical structures, and thus may mislead evaluation of plans based on such volume dependent criteria such as dose-volume histograms and NTCP calculations",

abstract="PURPOSE: CT-based models of the patient that do not account for the motion of ventilation may not accurately predict the shape and position of critical abdominal structures. Respiratory gating technology for imaging and treatment is not yet widely available. The purpose of the current study is to explore an intermediate step to improve the veracity of the patient model and reduce the treated volume by acquiring the CT data with the patients holding their breath at normal exhale. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The ventilatory time courses of diaphragm movement for 15 patients (with no special breathing instructions) were measured using digitized movies from the fluoroscope during simulation. A subsequent clinical protocol was developed for treatment based on exhale CT models. CT scans (typically 3.5-mm slice thickness) were acquired at normal exhale using a spiral scanner. The scan volume was divided into two to three segments, to allow the patient to breathe in between. Margins were placed about intrahepatic target volumes based on the ventilatory excursion inferior to the target, and on only the reproducibility of exhale position superior to the target. RESULTS: The average patient's diaphragm remained within 25\% of the range of ventilatory excursion from the average exhale position for 42\% of the typical breathing cycle, and within 25\% of the range from the average inhale position for 15\% of the cycle. The reproducibility of exhale position over multiple breathing cycles was 0.9 mm (2sigma), as opposed to 2.6 mm for inhale. Combining the variation of exhale position and the uncertainty in diaphragm position from CT slices led to typical margins of 10 mm superior to the target, and 19 mm inferior to the target, compared to margins of 19 mm in both directions under our prior protocol of margins based on free-breathing CT studies. For a typical intrahepatic target, these smaller volumes resulted in a 3.6\% reduction in Veff for the liver. Analysis of portal films shows proper target coverage for patients treated based on exhale modeled plans. CONCLUSIONS: Modeling abdominal treatments at exhale, while not realizing all the gains of gated treatments, provides an immediate reduction in the volume of normal tissue treated, and improved reliability of patient data for NTCP modeling, when compared to current ``free breathing'' CT models of patients",

abstract="PURPOSE: A system has been developed for patient positioning based on real-time localization of implanted electromagnetic transponders (beacons). This study demonstrated the accuracy of the system before clinical trials. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We describe the overall system. The localization component consists of beacons and a source array. A rigid phantom was constructed to place the beacons at known offsets from a localization array. Tests were performed at distances of 80 and 270 mm from the array and at positions in the array plane of up to 8 cm offset. Tests were performed in air and saline to assess the effect of tissue conductivity and with multiple transponders to evaluate crosstalk. Tracking was tested using a dynamic phantom creating a circular path at varying speeds. RESULTS: Submillimeter accuracy was maintained throughout all experiments. Precision was greater proximal to the source plane (sigmax = 0.006 mm, sigmay = 0.01 mm, sigmaz = 0.006 mm), but continued to be submillimeter at the end of the designed tracking range at 270 mm from the array (sigmax = 0.27 mm, sigmay = 0.36 mm, sigmaz = 0.48 mm). The introduction of saline and the use of multiple beacons did not affect accuracy. Submillimeter accuracy was maintained using the dynamic phantom at speeds of up to 3 cm/s. CONCLUSION: This system has demonstrated the accuracy needed for localization and monitoring of position during treatment",

abstract="A method for real-time motion analysis based on passive markers is presented. An opto-electronic automatic motion analyser was used as hardware platform and the real-time operation was based on the interfacing between two levels of the system architecture. True real-time acquisition, processing and representation of two-dimensional and three-dimensional kinematics data were implemented through a newly conceived data acquisition procedure and high speed optimisation of the kinematics data processing. The method allows one to operate the motion analysis system in real-time; even when the data elaboration unit is required to perform other processing functions, the only consequence is a decrease in system sampling rate. The maximum number of processed and plotted markers in three dimensions at the highest system sampling rate (100 Hz) turned out to be suitable for the implementation of analytical and visual kinematics biofeedback. An example of the achievable level of complexity in terms of marker disposition model and graphic representation is reported by describing a demonstration of the real-time representation of human face movements. A clinical application of the method for patient position definition and control at radiotherapy units is presented",

abstract="PURPOSE: We wanted to assess the prevalence of pulmonary dysfunction as the underlying reason for inoperability among patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were considered for surgical treatment at the time of diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of all patients with NSCLC referred to our pulmonary function laboratory for preoperative evaluation between January 2001 and November 2001. Pulmonary function testing consisted of measurement of spirometric indices (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]), lung volumes and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, Xenon-133 quantitative ventilation and perfusion studies, and exercise testing when indicated. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics at the time of the evaluation were reviewed. RESULTS: The group comprised 206 consecutive potential surgical candidates (mean age, 64.7 years +/- 10.1 years) with NSCLC. Nearly half (45.6\%) of the patients had early-stage (I/II) disease, and the remainder had late-stage disease at the time of pulmonary evaluation. The average predicted FEV1 among all patients was 70.3\% +/- 19.6\% (range, 25\%-123\%). One hundred eight patients (52.4\%) were deemed surgically inoperable after the preoperative assessment. Severe pulmonary function impairment was identified as the reason for surgical inoperability in more than one third of these patients (40 of 108). CONCLUSION: A substantial number of patients with anatomically resectable NSCLC are deemed surgically ineligible based on poor lung function. Recognition of the magnitude of this problem is fundamental to the development of effective treatment options, which might include preoperative management strategies that could better prepare patients for surgery or, alternatively, aggressive nonsurgical approaches",

abstract="PURPOSE: To report patient tolerance and acute anorectal toxicity of an endorectal balloon used for prostate immobilization during 35 daily fractions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of 396 patients treated for prostate cancer from October 1997 to November 2001 were reviewed. Patients were treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Endorectal balloon catheter was inserted daily, inflated with 100 mL of air for immobilizing the prostate gland. Patient and treatment factors were analyzed. Patients received a mean dose of 77 Gy/35 fractions/7 weeks with no rectal block. RESULTS: None of the 396 patients halted treatment because of associated ano-rectal toxicity. No patient stated that he would decline to be treated again with rectal balloon. Three of 396 (0.8\%) patients required a reduction in the volume of the balloon to 50 mL. Seventeen of 396 (4.3\%) patients required Lidocaine jelly with the insertion of balloon. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grades 1 and 2 rectal toxicity occurred in 55/396 (13.9\%) and 73/396 (18.4\%), respectively. No RTOG grade 3 or 4 toxicities occurred. Topical anal medications were prescribed for 46 of 396 (11.6\%) patients and antidiarrhea medication for 27 of 396 (6.8\%) patients. Of patients with pretreatment anorectal disease, 50\% developed rectal toxicities over the 7 weeks. Rectal toxicity occurred most frequently in the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth week; 19.5\%, 20.8\%, 18.2\%, and 16.9\%, respectively. The duration of the toxicity measured lasted 1 week, 35.2\%; 2 weeks, 31.0\%; 3 weeks, 15.5\%; 4 weeks, 11.3\%; 5 weeks, 4.2\%; and 6 weeks, 2.8\%. CONCLUSION: Most of the patients, 393/396 (99.2\%), tolerated a 100 mL endorectal immobilization balloon for IMRT. The rate of acute anorectal toxicity was acceptable with no grade 3 or 4 toxicities. Duration of the toxicities typically was 1 to 2 weeks. Patients with pre-existing anorectal disease are at higher risk of developing acute anorectal toxicity with the use of an endorectal balloon",

abstract="At present, radiotherapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy offers the only chance of cure of medically inoperable or locally advanced unresectable non-small cell lung cancer. The radiobiological basis and clinical results of current dose and fractionation concepts in the primary radiotherapy of NSCLC are briefly reviewed. Whenever possible, focus is given to the results of randomized phase III trials. With the exception of early disease treated to doses higher than 60 Gy, the prognosis of inoperable localized NSCLC is very poor. Local recurrence is the major cause of failure after radiation therapy calling for intensified local treatment. Dose-escalation using conventional fractionation or moderate hypofractionation is promising but randomized trials are presently not available. Dose-escalated hyperfractionation theoretically offers advantages, however, there appears currently no strong evidence from randomized trials supporting this approach in NSCLC. The highly accelerated CHART regimen significantly improved survival by 9\% compared to standard radiotherapy. Nevertheless, even when treated with CHART, about 80\% of all patients will eventually develop local recurrence and 60\% distant metastases. Many trials on combined radiochemotherapy have used radiotherapy regimens that are not optimal from a current perspective. Because of the high rate of both, local recurrence and distant metastases, future research should be directed to further intensify radiotherapy as well as to integrate such protocols with systemic treatment in carefully selected patients. Since toxicity is expected to increase, state-of-the-art 3D conformal radiation techniques need to be part of clinical trials testing such strategies",

abstract="PURPOSE:The impact of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) on 3-year progression-free survival of medically inoperable patients with stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was analyzed in a prospective phase II study. PATIENTS AND METHODS:Fifty-seven patients with T1NOMO (70\%) and T2N0M0 (30\%) were included between August 2003 and September 2005 at seven different centers in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark and observed up to 36 months. SBRT was delivered with 15 Gy times three at the 67\% isodose of the planning target volume. RESULTS:Progression-free survival at 3 years was 52\%. Overall- and cancer-specific survival at 1, 2, and 3 years was 86\%, 65\%, 60\%, and 93\%, 88\%, 88\%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in survival between patients with T1 or T2 tumors. At a median follow-up of 35 months (range, 4 to 47 months), 27 patients (47\%) were deceased, seven as a result of lung cancer and 20 as a result of concurrent disease. Kaplan-Meier estimated local control at 3 years was 92\%. Local relapse was observed in four patients (7\%). Regional relapse was observed in three patients (5\%). Nine patients (16\%) developed distant metastases. The estimated risk of all failure (local, regional, or distant metastases) was increased in patients with T2 (41\%) compared with those with T1 (18\%) tumors (P = .027). CONCLUSION:With a 3-year local tumor control rate higher than 90\% with limited toxicity, SBRT emerges as state-of-the-art treatment for medically inoperable stage I NSCLC and may even challenge surgery in operable instances.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To quantify prostate and seminal vesicle positional changes (target motion) between treatment planning and delivery, and to identify the factors contributing to target motion. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate were prospectively evaluated by analyzing two sequential planning computerized tomography (CT) scans (S1, obtained prior to treatment, and S2, obtained during the fourth week of treatment) for each patient. All anatomical volumes of interest (soft tissue and bony) were reconstructed from transverse CT images and projected onto anterior and lateral beam's-eye view projections. Positional changes between S1 and S2 were eliminated by applying a rigid body translation and rotation. Target motion was then measured by recording the positional change between S1 and S2 at the edges (right, left, superior, inferior). Potential correlation of target motion with bladder volume, rectal volume, and rectal diameter changes were evaluated by linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Neither the prostate nor seminal vesicles remained fixed with respect to bony anatomy between S1 and S2. The distribution of positional changes were generally small (< 0.5 cm), but maximum displacements of 1.5-2.2 cm did occur, particularly in the lateral view. In this study, bladder volume changes between the scans were small and did not correlate with target motion (P = 0.67). Both rectal volume and rectal diameter changes correlated with target motion for both the prostate (p = 0.004 and 0.005, respectively) and seminal vesicles (p < 0.001 and < 0.001, respectively). However, neither the initial rectal volume nor the initial rectal diameter could be used to predict subsequent target motion when evaluated either singly or as part of a multiple regression model. CONCLUSIONS: Target motion occurs during the course of treatment planning and delivery and should be considered when designing conformal radiation fields. Although the target position at the time of planning CT may differ substantially from the mean treatment position, target motion cannot be predicted by evaluating simply measured parameters from a single scan, or double scan sequence",

abstract="PURPOSE: We investigated the correlation between the motions of an external marker and internal fiducials implanted in the liver for 8 patients undergoing respiratory-based computed tomography (four-dimensional CT [4D-CT]) procedures. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The internal fiducials were gold seeds, 3 mm in length and 1.2 mm in diameter. Four patients each had one implanted fiducial, and the other four had three implanted fiducials. The external marker was a plastic box, which is part of the Real-Time Position Management System (RPM) used to track the patient's respiration. Each patient received a standard helical CT scan followed by a time-correlated CT-image acquisition (4D-CT). The 4D-CT images were reconstructed in 10 separate phases covering the entire respiratory cycle. RESULTS: The internal fiducial motion is predominant in the superior-inferior direction, with a range of 7.5-17.5 mm. The correlation between external respiration and internal fiducial motion is best during expiration. For 2 patients with their three fiducials separated by a maximum of 3.2 cm, the motions of the fiducials were well correlated, whereas for 2 patients with more widely spaced fiducials, there was less correlation. CONCLUSIONS: In general, there is a good correlation between internal fiducial motion imaged by 4D-CT and external marker motion. We have demonstrated that gating may be best performed at the end of the respiratory cycle. Special attention should be paid to gating for patients whose fiducials do not move in synchrony, because targeting on the correct respiratory amplitude alone would not guarantee that the entire tumor volume is within the treatment field",

The device was tested for angular sensitivity by irradiating it from 36 different gantry angles, and the responses of the device to various step-and-shoot segment doses and dose rates were evaluated using an ionization chamber as a comparison. The phantom was then compared with ionization chamber and film results for two prostate and pelvic nodes IMRT plans, two head and neck IMRT plans and two lung VMAT plans. These plans were calculated using Pinnacle(3) (Philips Radiation Oncology Systems, Madison, WI). The uniformity of angular response was better than 0.5\% over the range of gantry angles. The uniformity of response of the Delta(4) to different segment monitor units and dose rates was better than 0.5\%. The assessment of the IMRT and VMAT plans showed that the Delta(4) measured a dose within 2.5\% of the ionization chamber, and compared to film recorded a slightly larger region (range -2\% to +7\%) agreeing with the planned dose to within 3\% and 3 mm. The Delta(4) is a complex device and requires careful benchmarking, but following the successful completion of these measurements, the Delta(4) has been introduced into clinical use",

abstract="The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of consistency metrics, such as inverse consistency, in contour-based deformable registration error analysis. Four images were acquired of the same phantom that has experienced varying levels of deformation. The deformations were simulated with deformable image registration. Using calculated deformation maps, the inconsistencies within the algorithm were investigated. This can be done, for example, by calculating deformation maps both in forward and reverse directions and applying them subsequently to an image. If the algorithm is not inverse consistent, then this final image will not be the same as the original, as it should be. Other consistency tests were done, for example by comparing different algorithms or by applying the deformation maps to a circular set of multiple deformations, whereby the original and final images are in fact the same. The resulting composite deformation map in this case contains a combination of the errors within those maps, because if error free, the resulting deformation map should be zero everywhere. We have termed this the generalized inverse consistency error map (Sigma(Chi)). The correlation between the consistency metrics and registration error varied considerably depending on the registration algorithm and type of consistency metric. There was also a trend for the actual registration error to be larger than the consistency metrics. A disadvantage of these techniques is that good performance in these consistency checks is a necessary but not sufficient condition for an accurate deformation method",

abstract="This article is a tribute to the pioneering medical physicists over the last 50 years who have participated in the research, development, and commercialization of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic radiotherapy utilizing a wide range of technology. The authors have described the evolution of SRS through the eyes of physicists from its beginnings with the Gamma Knife in 1951 to proton and charged particle therapy; modification of commercial linacs to accommodate high precision SRS setups; the multitude of accessories that have enabled fine tuning patients for relocalization, immobilization, and repositioning with submillimeter accuracy; and finally the emerging technology of SBRT. A major theme of the article is the expanding role of the medical physicist from that of advisor to the neurosurgeon to the current role as a primary driver of new technology that has already led to an adaptation of cranial SRS to other sites in the body, including, spine, liver, and lung. SRS continues to be at the forefront of the impetus to provide technological precision for radiation therapy and has demonstrated a host of downstream benefits in improving delivery strategies for conventional therapy as well. While this is not intended to be a comprehensive history, and the authors could not delineate every contribution by all of those working in the pursuit of SRS development, including physicians, engineers, radiobiologists, and the rest of the therapy and dosimetry staff in this important and dynamic radiation therapy modality, it is clear that physicists have had a substantial role in the development of SRS and theyincreasingly play a leading role in furthering SRS technology",

It is uncertain whether AF is associated with excess mortality independent of associated cardiac conditions and risk factors. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the mortality of subjects 55 to 94 years of age who developed AF during 40 years of follow-up of the original Framingham Heart Study cohort. Of the original 5209 subjects, 296 men and 325 women (mean ages, 74 and 76 years, respectively) developed AF and met eligibility criteria. By pooled logistic regression, after adjustment for age, hypertension, smoking, diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, valvular heart disease, and stroke or transient ischemic attack, AF was associated with an OR for death of 1.5 (95\% CI, 1.2 to 1.8) in men and 1.9 (95\% CI, 1.5 to 2.2) in women. The risk of mortality conferred by AF did not significantly vary by age. However, there was a significant AF-sex interaction: AF diminished the female advantage in survival. In secondary multivariate analyses, in subjects free of valvular heart disease and preexisting cardiovascular disease, AF remained significantly associated with excess mortality, with about a doubling of mortality in both sexes. CONCLUSIONS: In subjects from the original cohort of the Framingham Heart Study, AF was associated with a 1.5- to 1.9-fold mortality risk after adjustment for the preexisting cardiovascular conditions with which AF was related. The decreased survival seen with AF was present in men and women and across a wide range of ages",

number="2",
pages="243--255",
abstract="The design of an integrated radiotherapy imaging system (IRIS), consisting of gantry mounted diagnostic (kV) x-ray tubes and fast read-out flat-panel amorphous-silicon detectors, has been studied. The system is meant to be capable of three main functions: radiographs for three-dimensional (3D) patient set-up, cone-beam CT and real-time tumour/marker tracking. The goal of the current study is to determine whether one source/panel pair is sufficient for real-time tumour/marker tracking and, if two are needed, the optimal position of each relative to other components and the isocentre. A single gantry-mounted source/imager pair is certainly capable of the first two of the three functions listed above and may also be useful for the third, if combined with prior knowledge of the target?s trajectory. This would be necessary because only motion in two dimensions is visible with a single imager/source system. However, with previously collected information about the trajectory, the third coordinate may be derived from the other two with sufficient accuracy to facilitate tracking. This deduction of the third coordinate can only be made if the 3D tumour/marker trajectory is consistent from fraction to fraction. The feasibility of tumour tracking with one source/imager pair has been theoretically examined here using measured lung marker trajectory data for seven patients from multiple treatment fractions. The patients? selection criteria include minimum mean amplitudes of the tumour motions greater than 1 cm peak-to-peak. The marker trajectory for each patient was modelled using the first fraction data. Then for the rest of the data, marker positions were derived from the imager projections at various gantry angles and compared with the measured tumour positions. Our results show that, due to the three dimensionality and irregular trajectory characteristics of tumour motion, on a fraction-to-fraction basis, a \&lsquo;monoscopic\&rsquo; system (single source/imager) is inadequate for consistent real-time tumour tracking, even with prior knowledge. We found that, among the seven patients studied with peak-to-peak marker motion greater than 1 cm, five cases have mean localization errors greater than 2 mm and two have mean errors greater than 3 mm. Because of this uncertainty associated with a monoscopic system, two source/imager pairs are necessary for robust 3D target localization. Dual orthogonal x-ray source/imager pairs mounted on the linac gantry are chosen for the IRIS. We further studied the placement of the x-ray sources/panel based on the geometric specifications of the Varian 21EX Clinac. The best configuration minimizes the localization error while maintaining a large field of view and avoiding collisions with the floor/ceiling or couch",

abstract="Due to the risk of pneumothorax, many clinicians are reluctant to implant radiopaque markers within patients? lungs for the purpose of radiographic or fluoroscopic tumour localization. We propose a method of gated therapy using fluoroscopic information without the implantation of radiopaque markers. The method presented here does not rely on any external motion signal either. Breathing phase information is found by analysing the fluoroscopic intensity fluctuations in the lung. As the lungs fill/empty, the radiological pathlength through them shortens/lengthens, giving brighter/darker fluoroscopic intensities. The phase information is combined with motion-enhanced template matching to turn the beam on when the tumour is in the desired location. A study based on patient data is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of this procedure. The resulting beam-on pattern is similar to that produced by an external gating system. The only discrepancies occur briefly and at the gate edges",

Implanted radiopaque fiducial markers inside or near the target are required for this technique. The markers are contoured on the planning CT set, enabling us to create digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) for each treatment beam. During the treatment, a sequence of EPID images can be acquired without disrupting the treatment. Implanted markers are visualized in the images and their positions in the beam's eye view are calculated off-line and compared to the reference position by matching the field apertures in corresponding EPID and DRR images. The precision of the patient set-up, the placement of the beam-gating window, as well as the residual tumour motion can be assessed for each treatment fraction. This technique has been demonstrated with a case study patient, who had three markers implanted in his liver. For this patient, the intra-fractional variation of all marker positions in the gating window had a 95\% range of 4.8 mm in the SI direction (the primary axis of motion). This was about the same (5 mm) as the residual motion considered in the planning process. The inter-fractional variation of the daily mean positions of the markers, which indicates the uncertainty in the set-up procedure, was within +8.3 mm/-4.5 mm (95\% range) in the SI direction for this case",

abstract="Stereotactic body radiation therapy is predicated on a high degree of targeting accuracy. However, inaccurate patient setup as well as intra-fractional motion can hinder the delivery of high doses preferentially to the target. To ensure that the coverage delivered to the patient is as planned, an image-guided verification system has been created to estimate the delivered dose retrospectively. This will not only aid the assessment of treatment techniques, but will also allow for more accurate dose response analysis. Patients with limited hepatic metastases from solid tumors were treated with SBRT. Implanted gold markers were used as target surrogates and a body frame and compression plate provided stereotactic localization and target immobilization, respectively. During treatment, an electronic portal imaging device (EPID), operating in cine mode, collected the exit dose. The sequences of images for each field were processed off-line using in-house software for registration and seed localization. The beam's-eye-view seed positions in the treatment images were compared to those in the DRR's to determine the target shifts in the imaging plane. These target shifts were then imported into the treatment planning software. Each original field was multiplied by the number of images taken during treatment. The calculated shift from each image was then applied to each of the new subfields. Summing all of these subfields together gives the dose distribution that was actually delivered to the patient. The dose-volume histograms for the planned and delivered distributions for four patients' complete treatments are shown. For two of the patients, underdosing due to a setup error or intra-fractional drift was not wholly resolved by subsequent fractions. For one of these patients two alternative corrective strategies have been applied, retrospectively, and the prescribed target coverage recovered for both. The delivered dose can be estimated using the information contained in cine EPID images acquired during irradiation. Calculating the dose actually delivered to the target will allow us to assess treatment procedures as well as more accurately report clinical results",

The motion of the marker is tracked using a camera interfaced to a computer. Gated intervals were defined that limited the motion of the diaphragm to less than 1 cm during free breathing. Patients underwent a computed tomography virtual simulation using a breath-hold technique. At the time of treatment, verification of patient position and gating interval were performed using electronic portal imaging.ResultsBetween September 2000 and January 2002, 136 patients were simulated with respiratory gating. Of these, 108 patients were treated to 110 sites for a total of 2301 treatment sessions. Ninety-seven percent of patients completed their entire course of therapy with gated treatment delivery.ConclusionsRespiratory gating is a practical and achievable solution for minimizing respiratory-induced target motion during both simulation and treatment. With proper patient selection and training, it can be successfully implemented in a clinical radiation therapy department",

abstract="External beam irradiation requires precise positioning of the target relative to the treatment planning coordinate system. A three-dimensional (3D) surface imaging system for patient positioning has recently been installed in one of our linear accelerator (linac) rooms. The device utilizes close-range photogrammetry to generate a 3D model of the patient's surface. This geometric model can be made to look like a digital camera image if wrapped with a gray-level image (texture mapping) that shows surface coloration. The system is calibrated to the linac coordinate system and has been designed as a patient setup device. To reproduce patient position in fractionated radiotherapy, the daily patient surface model is registered to a previously recorded reference surface. Using surface registration, the system calculates the rigid-body transformation that minimizes the distance between the treatment and the reference surface models in a region-of-interest (ROI). This transformation is expressed as a set of new couch coordinates at which the patient position best matches with the reference data. If respiratory motion is a concern, the surface can be obtained with a gated acquisition at a specified phase of the respiratory cycle. To analyze the accuracy of the system, we performed several experiments with phantoms to assess stability, alignment accuracy, precision of the gating function, and surface topology. The reproducibility of surface measurements was tested for periods up to 57 h. Each recorded frame was registered to the reference surface to calculate the required couch adjustment. The system stability over this time period was better than 0.5 mm. To measure the accuracy of the system to detect and quantify patient shift relative to a reference image, we compared the shift detected by the surface imaging system with known couch transitions in a phantom study. The maximum standard deviation was 0.75 mm for the three translational degrees of freedom, and less than 0.1 degrees for each rotation. Surface model precision was tested against computed tomography (CT)-derived surface topology. The root-mean-square rms of the distance between the surfaces was 0.65 mm, excluding regions where beam hardening caused artifacts in the CT data. Measurements were made to test the gated acquisition mode. The time-dependent amplitude was measured with the surface imaging system and an established respiratory gating system based on infrared (IR)-marker detection. The measured motion trajectories from both systems were compared to the known trajectory of the stage. The standard deviations of the amplitude differences to the motor trajectory were 0.04 and 0.15 mm for the IR-marker system and the 3D surface imaging system, respectively. A limitation of the surface-imaging device is the frame rate of 6.5 Hz, because rapid changes of the motion trajectory cannot be detected. In conclusion, the system is accurate and sufficiently stable to be used in the clinic. The errors computed when comparing the surface model with CT geometry were submillimeter, and deviations in the alignment and gating-signal tests were of the same magnitude",

abstract="PURPOSE: To assess the utility of surface imaging on patient setup for accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI). METHODS AND MATERIAL: A photogrammetry system was used in parallel to APBI setup by laser and portal imaging. Surface data were acquired after laser and port-film setup for 9 patients. Surfaces were analyzed in comparison to a reference surface from the first treatment session by use of rigid transformations. The surface model after laser setup was used in a simulated photogrammetry setup procedure. In addition, breathing data were acquired by surface acquisition at a frame rate of 7 Hz. RESULTS: Mean 3D displacement was 7.3 mm (SD, 4.4 mm) and 7.6 mm (SD, 4.2 mm) for laser and port film, respectively. Simulated setup with the photogrammetry system yielded mean displacement of 1 mm (SD, 1.2 mm). Distance analysis resulted in mean distances of 3.7 mm (SD, 4.9 mm), 4.3 mm (SD, 5.6 mm), and 1.6 mm (SD, 2.4 mm) for laser, port film, and photogrammetry, respectively. Breathing motion at isocenter was smaller than 3.7 mm, with a mean of 1.9 mm (SD, 1.1 mm). CONCLUSIONS: Surface imaging for PBI setup appears promising. Alignment of the 3D breast surface achieved by stereo-photogrammetry shows greater breast topology congruence than when patients are set up by laser or portal imaging. A correlation of breast surface and CTV must be quantitatively established",

abstract="At Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI) more than 330 patients have been treated with scanned carbon ion beams in a pilot project. To date, only stationary tumors have been treated. In the presence of motion, scanned ion beam therapy is not yet possible because of interplay effects between scanned beam and target motion which can cause severe mis-dosage. We have started a project to treat tumors that are subject to respiratory motion. A prototype beam application system for target tracking with the scanned pencil beam has been developed and commissioned. To facilitate treatment planning for tumors that are subject to organ motion, we have extended our standard treatment planning system TRiP to full 4D functionality. The 4D version of TRiP allows to calculate dose distributions in the presence of motion. Furthermore, for motion mitigation techniques tracking, gating, rescanning, and internal margins optimization of treatment parameters has been implemented. 4D calculations are based on 4D computed tomography data, deformable registration maps, organ motion traces, and beam scanning parameters.We describe the methods of our 4D treatment planning approach and demonstrate functionality of the system for phantom as well as patient data",

abstract="Scanned particle beams and target motion interfere. This interplay leads to deterioration of the dose distribution. Experiments and a treatment planning study were performed to investigate interplay. Experiments were performed with moving radiographic films for different motion parameters. Resulting dose distributions were analyzed for homogeneity and dose coverage. The treatment planning study was based on the time-resolved computed tomography (4DCT) data of five lung tumor patients. Treatment plans with margins to account for respiratory motion were optimized, and resulting dose distributions for 108 different motion parameters for each patient were calculated. Data analysis for a single fraction was based on dose-volume histograms and the volume covered with 95\% of the planned dose. Interplay deteriorated dose conformity and homogeneity (1-standard deviation/mean) in the experiments as well as in the treatment-planning study. The homogeneity on radiographic films was below 80\% for motion amplitudes of 15 mm. For the treatment-planning study based on patient data, the target volume receiving at least 95\% of the prescribed dose was on average (standard deviation) 71.0\% (14.2\%). Interplay of scanned particle beams and moving targets has severe impact on the resulting dose distributions. Fractionated treatment delivery potentially mitigates at least parts of these interplay effects. However, especially for small fraction numbers, e.g. hypo-fractionation, treatment of moving targets with scanned particle beams requires motion mitigation techniques such as rescanning, gating, or tracking.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To demonstrate mitigation of the interplay effects of scanned particle beams and residual target motion within a gating window by increased overlap of pencil beams. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Lateral overlap was increased by increasing the pencil beam widths or by decreasing the distance between the pencil beams (scan grid). Longitudinal overlap was increased by reducing the distance between iso-range slices. For scanned carbon ion beams, simulation studies were performed and validated experimentally to determine the required parameters for different residual motion characteristics. The dose distributions were characterized by the maximal local deviations representing local over- and underdosage. RESULTS: For residual lateral motion, the local deviations were <5\% for 2, 4, and 7 mm residual motion within the gating window for a 2-mm scan grid and pencil beams of 10, 14, and 18 mm full width at half maximum, respectively. Decreasing the iso-range slice distance from 3 mm to 1 mm effectively mitigated <or=10 mm water-equivalent range changes. Experimental data reproduced the simulation results. CONCLUSION: In charged particle therapy with a scanned beam, interplay effects between gated beam delivery and residual target motion can be decreased effectively by increasing the overlap between pencil beams laterally, as well as longitudinally",

GSI proposed beam tracking and performed several experimental studies to analyse the dosimetric precision of the system for scanned carbon beams. METHODS: A beam tracking system has been developed and integrated in the scanned carbon ion beam therapy unit at GSI. The system adapts pencil beam positions and beam energy according to target motion. Motion compensation performance of the beam tracking system was assessed by measurements with radiographic films, a range telescope, a 3D array of 24 ionization chambers, and cell samples for biological dosimetry. Measurements were performed for stationary detectors and moving detectors using the beam tracking system. RESULTS: All detector systems showed comparable data for a moving setup when using beam tracking and the corresponding stationary setup. Within the target volume the relative differences of ionization chamber measurements were 0.3\% (1.5\% standard deviation, 3.7\% maximum). Film responses demonstrated preserved lateral dose gradients. Measurements with the range telescope showed agreement of Bragg peak depth under motion induced range variations. Cell survival experiments showed a mean relative difference of -5\% (-3\%) between measurements and calculations within the target volume for beam tracking (stationary) measurements. CONCLUSIONS: The beam tracking system has been successfully integrated. Full functionality has been validated dosimetrically in experiments with several detector types including biological cell systems",

abstract="Charged particle beam radiotherapy requires dedicated measures to compensate for the dosimetric influence of inter- and intra-fractional target motion. Independent of the delivery technique, these measures have to incorporate the strong influence of the radiological depth on the delivered dose. For scanned beam delivery, interference effects of target motion and scanned beam can further cause under-dosage of the clinical target volume despite using margins. Within the scope of this review, published data with respect to motion management in scattered as well as scanned beam treatment delivery will be summarized. Based on a section covering the dosimetric impact of organ motion, motion management during treatment planning, patient positioning, treatment delivery and treatment validation will be summarized. For scattered beam delivery, the concepts and data are often based on clinical usage since treatment of moving tumors has been performed for several years.

abstract="ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Treatment of moving target volumes with scanned particle beams benefits from treatment planning that includes the time domain (4D). Part of 4D treatment planning is calculation of the expected result. These calculation codes should be verified against suitable measurements. We performed simulations and measurements to validate calculation of the film response in the presence of target motion. METHODS: All calculations were performed with GSI's treatment planning system TRiP. Interplay patterns between scanned particle beams and moving film detectors are very sensitive to slight deviations of the assumed motion parameters and therefore ideally suited to validate 4D calculations. In total, 14 film motion parameter combinations with lateral motion amplitudes of 8, 15, and 20 mm and 4 combinations for lateral motion including range changes were used. Experimental and calculated film responses were compared by relative difference, mean deviation in two regions-of-interest, as well as line profiles. RESULTS: Irradiations of stationary films resulted in a mean relative difference of 1.52\% +/- 2.06\% of measured and calculated responses. In comparison to this reference result, measurements with translational film motion resulted in a mean difference of -0.92\% +/- 1.30\%. In case of irradiations incorporating range changes with a stack of 5 films as detector the deviations increased to -6.4 +/- 2.6\% (10.3 +/- 9.0\% if film in distal fall-off is included) in comparison to 3.6\% +/- 2.5\% (13.5\% +/- 19.9\% including the distal film) for the stationary irradiation. Furthermore, the comparison of line profiles of 4D calculations and experimental data showed only slight deviations at the borders of the irradiated area. The comparisons of pure lateral motion were used to determine the number of motion states that are required for 4D calculations depending on the motion amplitude. 6 motion states per 10 mm motion amplitude are sufficient to calculate the film response in the presence of motion. CONCLUSIONS: By comparison to experimental data, the 4D extension of GSI's treatment planning system TRiP has been successfully validated for film response calculations in the presence of target motion within the accuracy limitation given by film-based dosimetry",

abstract="Radiation therapy using high-energy charged particles is generally acknowledged as a powerful new technique in cancer treatment. However, particle therapy in oncology is still controversial, specifically because it is unclear whether the putative clinical advantages justify the high additional costs. However, particle therapy can find important applications in the management of noncancer diseases, especially in radiosurgery. Extension to other diseases and targets (both cranial and extracranial) may widen the applications of the technique and decrease the cost/benefit ratio of the accelerator facilities. Future challenges in this field include the use of different particles and energies, motion management in particle body radiotherapy and extension to new targets currently treated by catheter ablation (atrial fibrillation and renal denervation) or stereotactic radiation therapy (trigeminal neuralgia, epilepsy, and macular degeneration). Particle body radiosurgery could be a future key application of accelerator-based particle therapy facilities in 10 years from today",

abstract="PURPOSE: To establish the radiobiologic parameters of head-and-neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) in response to ion irradiation with various linear energy transfer (LET) values and to evaluate the relevance of the local effect model (LEM) in HNSCC. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Cell survival curves were established in radiosensitive SCC61 and radioresistant SQ20B cell lines irradiated with [33.6 and 184 keV/n] carbon, [302 keV/n] argon, and X-rays. The results of ion experiments were confronted to LEM predictions. RESULTS: The relative biologic efficiency ranged from 1.5 to 4.2 for SCC61 and 2.1 to 2.8 for SQ20B cells. Fixing an arbitrary D(0) parameter, which characterized survival to X-ray at high doses (>10 Gy), gave unsatisfying LEM predictions for both cell lines. For D(0) = 10 Gy, the error on survival fraction at 2 Gy amounted to a factor of 10 for [184 keV/n] carbon in SCC61 cells. We showed that the slope (s(max)) of the survival curve at high doses was much more reliable than D(0). Fitting s(max) to 2.5 Gy(-1) gave better predictions for both cell lines. Nevertheless, LEM could not predict the responses to fast and slow ions with the same accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: The LEM could predict the main trends of these experimental data with correct orders of magnitude while s(max) was optimized. Thus the efficiency of carbon ions cannot be simply extracted from the clinical response of a patient to X-rays. LEM should help to optimize planning for hadrontherapy if a set of experimental data is available for high-LET radiations in various types of tumors",

abstract="Respiratory organ motion has a significant impact on the planning and delivery of radiotherapy (RT) treatment for lung cancer. Currently widespread techniques, such as 4D-computed tomography (4DCT), cannot be used to measure variability of this motion from one cycle to the next. In this paper, we describe the use of fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to investigate the intra- and inter-cycle reproducibility of respiratory motion and also to estimate the level of errors that may be introduced into treatment delivery by using various breath-hold imaging strategies during lung RT planning. A reference model of respiratory motion is formed to enable comparison of different breathing cycles at any arbitrary position in the respiratory cycle. This is constructed by using free-breathing images from the inhale phase of a single breathing cycle, then co-registering the images, and thereby tracking landmarks. This reference model is then compared to alternative models constructed from images acquired during the exhale phase of the same cycle and the inhale phase of a subsequent cycle, to assess intra- and inter-cycle variability ('hysteresis' and 'reproducibility') of organ motion. The reference model is also compared to a series of models formed from breath-hold data at exhale and inhale. Evaluation of these models is carried out on data from ten healthy volunteers and five lung cancer patients. Free-breathing models show good levels of intra- and inter-cycle reproducibility across the tidal breathing range. Mean intra-cycle errors in the position of organ surface landmarks of 1.5(1.4)-3.5(3.3) mm for volunteers and 2.8(1.8)-5.2(5.2) mm for patients. Equivalent measures of inter-cycle variability across this range are 1.7(1.0)-3.9(3.3) mm for volunteers and 2.8(1.8)-3.3(2.2) mm for patients. As expected, models based on breath-hold sequences do not represent normal tidal motion as well as those based on free-breathing data, with mean errors of 4.4(2.2)-7.7(3.9) mm for volunteers and 10.1(6.1)-12.5(6.3) mm for patients. Errors are generally larger still when using a single breath-hold image at either exhale or inhale to represent the lung. This indicates that account should be taken of intra- and inter-cycle respiratory motion variability and that breath-hold-based methods of obtaining data for RT planning may potentially introduce large errors. This approach to analysis of motion and variability has potential to inform decisions about treatment margins and optimize RT planning",

abstract="The inactivation of cells resulting in lethal or aberrant effects by charged particles is of growing interest. Charged particles at extremely high LET are capable of completely eliminating cell-type and cell-line differences in repair capacity. It is still not clear however whether the repair systems are inactivated, or merely that heavy-ion lesions are less repairable. Studies correlating the particle inactivation dose of radioresistant cells with intact DNA analyzed with pulse field gel electrophoresis and other techniques may be useful, but more experiments are also needed to assess the fidelity of repair. For particle irradiations between 40-100 keV/microns there is however evidence for particle-induced activation of specific genes in mammalian cells, and certain repair processes in bacteria. New data are available on the inactivation of developmental processes in several systems including seeds, and cells of the nematode C. elegans. Future experimental and theoretical modeling research emphasis should focus on exploring particle-induced inactivation of endpoints assessing functionality and not just lethality, and on analyzing molecular damage and genetic effects arising in damaged but non-inactivated survivors. The discrete nature of selective types of particle damage as a function of radiation quality indicates the value of accelerated ions as probes of normal and aberrant biological processes. Information obtained from molecular analyses of damage and repair must however be integrated into the context of cellular and tissue functions of the organism",

abstract="Shortly after the discovery of polonium and radium by Marie Curie and her husband and colleague, Pierre Curie, it was learned that exposure to these alpha-particle emitters produced deleterious biological effects. The mechanisms underlying the increased biological effectiveness of densely ionizing radiations, including alpha particles, neutrons and highly energetic heavy charged particles, remain an active area of investigation. In this paper, we review recent advances in several areas of the radiobiology of these densely ionizing radiations, also known as heavy ions. Advances are described in the areas of DNA damage and repair, chromosome aberrations, mutagenesis, neoplastic transformation in vitro, genomic instability, normal tissue radiobiology and carcinogenesis in vivo. We focus on technical innovations, including novel applications of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), linkage analysis, and studies of gene expression and protein expression. We also highlight the use of new cellular and animal systems, including those with defined DNA repair deficiencies, as well as epithelial cell model systems to assess neoplastic transformation both in vitro and in vivo. The studies reviewed herein have had a substantial impact on our understanding of the genotoxic effects of heavy ions as well as their distinct effects on tissue homeostasis. The use of these radiations in cancer therapy is also discussed. The use of both heavy-ion and proton therapy is on the upswing in several centers around the world, due to their unique energy deposition characteristics that enhance the therapeutic effect and help reduce damage to normal tissue",

abstract="Summary Successful cancer patient survival and local tumor control from hadron radiotherapy warrant a discussion of potential secondary late effects from the radiation. The study of late-appearing clinical effects from particle beams of protons, carbon, or heavier ions is a relatively new field with few data. However, new clinical information is available from pioneer hadron radiotherapy programs in the USA, Japan, Germany and Switzerland. This paper will review available data on late tissue effects from particle radiation exposures, and discuss its importance to the future of hadron therapy. Potential late radiation effects are associated with irradiated normal tissue volumes at risk that in many cases can be reduced with hadron therapy. However, normal tissues present within hadron treatment volumes can demonstrate enhanced responses compared to conventional modes of therapy. Late endpoints of concern include induction of secondary cancers, cataract, fibrosis, neurodegeneration, vascular damage, and immunological, endocrine and hereditary effects. Low-dose tissue effects at tumor margins need further study, and there is need for more acute molecular studies underlying late effects of hadron therapy",

These algorithms have already been validated for several phantom geometries irradiated under clinical conditions. It is the aim of the present study to investigate the applicability of a liquid-filled electronic portal imaging device in combination with these algorithms for two-dimensional midplane dose verification in clinical practice. MEASUREMENTS AND METHODS: Portal dose images were obtained during several patient treatments under routine clinical conditions. Measurements were performed to verify the midplane dose during radiotherapy of larynx cancer with 4 MV beams, breast and lung cancer with 8 MV beams and prostate cancer with both 8 and 18 MV beams. Midplane doses, determined from portal dose measurements and analyzed with our algorithms, were compared with midplane doses calculated with our three-dimensional (3D) treatment planning system (TPS). RESULTS: For the larynx treatment the measured 2D midplane dose agreed within 2.0\% with TPS calculations in most parts of the field. Larger differences were found in a small region below the skin due to the absence of electron equilibrium, which is not taken into account in our portal dose analysis. For breast irradiations the measured midplane dose showed a homogeneous distribution in the AP direction in the axial plane, while high dose regions were observed in the cranial and caudal part of the breast. Portal dose measurements and TPS calculations agreed within 2.5\% for most of the prostate and lung irradiations. For a few of the prostate and lung treatments larger local differences were found due to differences between the actual patient anatomy and the planning CT data, e.g. as a result of variable gas filling in the rectum and anatomical changes in the lung. CONCLUSIONS: Portal dose measurements with a liquid-filled electronic portal imaging device can be used to determine the 2D midplane dose for various treatment sites in clinical practice. Portal in vivo dosimetry has proven to be important in detecting changes in the patient's anatomy and its influence on the dose delivery. It is concluded that portal dosimetry is an excellent tool for accurate and independent verification of the dose in the entire (2D) midplane during patient treatment. However, a limited number of patients were involved in this study and the results are therefore preliminary. More research is needed to fully assess the clinical value of portal dose measurements",

abstract="We present a method to implement probabilistic treatment planning of intensity-modulated radiation therapy using custom software plugins in a commercial treatment planning system. Our method avoids the definition of safety-margins by directly including the effect of geometrical uncertainties during optimization when objective functions are evaluated. Because the shape of the resulting dose distribution implicitly defines the robustness of the plan, the optimizer has much more flexibility than with a margin-based approach. We expect that this added flexibility helps to automatically strike a better balance between target coverage and dose reduction for surrounding healthy tissue, especially for cases where the planning target volume overlaps organs at risk. Prostate cancer treatment planning was chosen to develop our method, including a novel technique to include rotational uncertainties. Based on population statistics, translations and rotations are simulated independently following a marker-based IGRT correction strategy. The effects of random and systematic errors are incorporated by first blurring and then shifting the dose distribution with respect to the clinical target volume. For simplicity and efficiency, dose-shift invariance and a rigid-body approximation are assumed. Three prostate cases were replanned using our probabilistic objective functions. To compare clinical and probabilistic plans, an evaluation tool was used that explicitly incorporates geometric uncertainties using Monte-Carlo methods. The new plans achieved similar or better dose distributions than the original clinical plans in terms of expected target coverage and rectum wall sparing. Plan optimization times were only about a factor of two higher than in the original clinical system. In conclusion, we have developed a practical planning tool that enables margin-less probability-based treatment planning with acceptable planning times, achieving the first system that is feasible for clinical implementation",

abstract="PURPOSE: To describe a remote positioning system for accurate and efficient proton radiotherapy treatments. METHODS AND MATERIALS: To minimize positioning time in the treatment room (and thereby maximize beam utility), we have adopted a method for remote patient positioning, with patients positioned and imaged outside the treatment room. Using a CT scanner, positioning is performed using orthogonal topograms with the measured differences to the reference images being used to define daily corrections to the patient table in the treatment room. Possible patient movements during transport and irradiation were analyzed through periodic acquisition of posttreatment topograms. Systematic and random errors were calculated for this daily positioning protocol and for two off-line protocols. The potential time advantage of remote positioning was assessed by computer simulation. RESULTS: Applying the daily correction protocol, systematic errors calculated over all patients (n = 94) were below 0.6 mm, whereas random errors were below 1.5 mm and 2.5 mm, respectively, for bite-block and for mask immobilization. Differences between pre- and posttreatment images were below 2.8 mm (SD) in abdominal/pelvic region, and below 2.4 mm (SD) in the head. Retrospective data analysis for a subset of patients revealed that off-line protocols would be significantly less accurate. Computer simulations showed that remote positioning can increase patient throughput up to 30\%. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a daily imaging and correction protocol based on a ``remote'' CT could reduce positioning errors to below 2.5 mm and increase beam utility in the treatment room. Patient motion between imaging and treatment were not significant",

abstract="In breast cancer adjuvant therapy, respiratory movements continuously modify the irradiated volumes and the anatomical shape of this body region. Fifteen patients were submitted to 3 Computed Tomography (CT) sequences for treatment planning: the first one without any indications to the patient (the standard sequence) and the second and the third one with spontaneous stopped inspiration and expiration, respectively; the patient was always in the same position. The treatment was planned on standard CT images and then applied to the other sequences, maintaining all parameters unvaried, including isocenter position and treatment time. The lung volumes within the fields (and those included in the 95\%, 100\%, 105\% isodoses referred to the prescribed dose) were evaluated with dose/volume histograms. The average irradiated lung was 69 cm3 (DS 28) in standard sequences, 136 cm3 (DS 67) in inspiration and 41 cm3 (DS 25) in expiration. The pulmonary volume within the above isodoses exhibited similar changes. In other words, the lung volume actually irradiated during the whole treatment is smaller than the one which can be calculated on standard CT sequences and it corresponds to expiration volume. The remaining part falls into a wide ``twilight zone'' relative to dose. Therefore, the true risk of lung toxicity can be similarly lower than the calculable one on standard CT images. Thus, the complication risk (based on dose/volume histograms and normal tissue control probability parameters) could be assessed in new prospective studies, introducing a corrective factor for the irradiated lung volume, because the latter is smaller than that shown by standard CT",

abstract="Conformal radiotherapy allows improvement in the treatment outcome due to increased targeting accuracy through advanced beam shaping techniques to precisely conform radiation dose to the geometry of the tumour. Treatment set-up and organ motion uncertainties are unavoidable factors that are limiting increases in accuracy and have to be accounted for in conformal treatment planning. The magnitudes of set-up errors and organ motion uncertainties for specific sites, and using various set-up techniques, have been quantified in the literature. However, the parameters used with these measurements and the presentation of the data has differed between studies for the same site. The purpose of this paper is to analyse and combine the published material into a uniform format and to display typical reported values of set-up and organ motion uncertainties. Values measured under similar conditions were averaged across studies. The results of this analysis illustrate (1) variability in the parameters used for measurements across studies, (2) typical motion ranges of the prostate, kidneys, liver and diaphragm, (3) typical means and standard deviations for set-up errors associated with the prostate, pelvis, brain, head and neck, thorax, rectum and breast and (4) a brief review of the common methods to lower or account for these uncertainties",

abstract="Purpose: Kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has been developed to provide accurate soft-tissue and bony setup information. We evaluated clinical CBCT setup data and compared CBCT measurements with electronic portal imaging device (EPID) images for lung cancer patients. Methods and Materials: The setup error for CBCT scans at the treatment unit relative to the planning CT was measured for 62 patients (524 scans). For 19 of these patients (172 scans) portal images were also made. The mean, systematic setup error ([Sigma]), and random setup error ([sigma]) were calculated for the CBCT and the EPID. The differences between CBCT and EPID and the rotational setup error derived from the CBCT were also evaluated. An offline shrinking action level correction protocol, based on the CBCT measurements, was used to reduce systematic setup errors and the impact of this protocol was evaluated. Results: The CBCT setup errors were significantly larger than the EPID setup errors for the cranial-caudal and anterior-posterior directions (p < 0.05). The mean overall setup errors after correction measured with the CBCT were 0.2 mm ([Sigma] = 1.6 mm, [sigma] = 2.9 mm) in the left-right, -0.8 mm ([Sigma] = 1.7 mm, [sigma] = 4.0 mm) in cranial-caudal and 0.0 mm ([Sigma] = 1.5 mm, [sigma] = 2.0 mm) in the anterior-posterior direction. Using our correction protocol only 2 patients had mean setup errors larger than 5 mm, without this correction protocol 51\% of the patients would have had a setup error larger than 5 mm. Conclusion: Use of CBCT scans provided more accurate information concerning the setup of lung cancer patients than did portal imaging",

abstract="A new algorithm for the reconstruction of two-dimensional (2D) images from projections is described. The algorithm is based on the decomposition of the projections into Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind, which are the ideal basis functions for this application. The Chebyshev decomposition is done via the fast discrete sine transform. A discrete reconstruction filter is applied that corresponds to the ramp filter used in standard filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstruction. In contrast to FBP, the filter is applied to the Chebyshev coefficients and not to the Fourier coefficients of the projections. Then the reconstructed image is simply obtained by means of backprojection. Consequently, the method can be considered as a Chebyshev-domain filtered backprojection (CD-FBP). The total calculation time is dominated by the backprojection step only and is comparable to FBP. The merits of CD-FBP as compared with standard FBP are that: (a) The result is exact if the 2D function to be reconstructed can be decomposed into polynomials of finite degree, and if the sampling is adequate. Otherwise a polynomial approximation results. (b) The algorithm is inherently discrete. (c) It is particularly well suited for reconstructions from projections with non-equidistant samples that occur for instance in 2D PET (positron emission tomography) imaging and in a special form of fan beam scanning. Examples of applications comprise reconstructions of the Shepp and Logan head phantom in various sampling geometries, and a real PET test object. In the PET example an increased resolution is observed in comparison with standard FBP",

volume="47",

pages="2203--2220",
abstract="There has been some concern that organ motion, especially intra-fraction organ motion due to breathing, can negate the potential merit of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). We wanted to find out whether this concern is justified. Specifically, we wanted to investigate whether IMRT delivery techniques with moving parts, e.g., with a multileaf collimator (MLC), are particularly sensitive to organ motion due to the interplay between organ motion and leaf motion. We also wanted to know if, and by how much, fractionation of the treatment can reduce the effects. We performed a statistical analysis and calculated the expected dose values and dose variances for volume elements of organs that move during the delivery of the IMRT. We looked at the overall influence of organ motion during the course of a fractionated treatment. A linear-quadratic model was used to consider fractionation effects. Furthermore, we developed software to simulate motion effects for IMRT delivery with an MLC, with compensators, and with a scanning beam. For the simulation we assumed a sinusoidal motion in an isocentric plane. We found that the expected dose value is independent of the treatment technique. It is just a weighted average over the path of motion of the dose distribution without motion. If the treatment is delivered in several fractions, the distribution of the dose around the expected value is close to a Gaussian. For a typical treatment with 30 fractions, the standard deviation is generally within 1\&percent; of the expected value for MLC delivery if one assumes a typical motion amplitude of 5 mm (1 cm peak to peak). The standard deviation is generally even smaller for the compensator but bigger for scanning beam delivery. For the latter it can be reduced through multiple deliveries (\&lquot;paintings\&rquot;) of the same field. In conclusion, the main effect of organ motion in IMRT is an averaging of the dose distribution without motion over the path of the motion. This is the same as for treatments with conventional beams. Additional effects that are specific to the IMRT delivery technique appear to be relatively small, except for the scanning beam",

abstract="PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the change in tumor volume, motion, and breathing frequency during a course of radiotherapy, for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 23 patients underwent computed tomography-positron emission tomography (CT-PET) and respiration correlated CT scans before treatment, which was repeated in the first and second weeks after the start of radiotherapy. Patients were treated with an accelerated fractionation schedule, 1.8 Gy twice a day, with a total tumor dose depending on preset dose constraints for the lungs and spinal cord. RESULTS: A striking heterogeneity of tumor volume changes was observed at all time points. In some patients the volume decreased >30\% (3/23), whereas in others the volume increased >30\% (4/24); but for the majority of patients (16/23), the tumor volume changed only slightly (<30\%). No significant changes in average tumor motion or breathing frequencies were observed during treatment. Although a number of changes in individual tumor motion were seen, only in 1 patient would this have led to an increase of the internal margin >1 mm in 1 direction, 1 week after the start of treatment, and in 3 patients for 1 direction, 2 weeks after the start of the treatment. CONCLUSION: In this patients in this study, a large variability in changes in tumor volume was observed. This underscores the need for repeated imaging during the course of radiotherapy. However, the changes in tumor motion are small, which indicates that repeated respiration correlated CT does not appear to be necessary",

abstract="A new technique of patient positioning for radiotherapy/radiosurgery of extracranial tumours using three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound images has been developed. The ultrasound probe position is tracked within the treatment room via infrared light emitting diodes (IRLEDs) attached to the probe. In order to retrieve the corresponding room position of the ultrasound image, we developed an initial ultrasound probe calibration technique for both 2D and 3D ultrasound systems. This technique is based on knowledge of points in both room and image coordinates. We first tested the performance of three algorithms in retrieving geometrical transformations using synthetic data with different noise levels. Closed form solution algorithms (singular value decomposition and Horn?s quaternion algorithms) were shown to outperform the Hooke and Jeeves iterative algorithm in both speed and accuracy. Furthermore, these simulations show that for a random noise level of 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 mm, the number of points required for a transformation accuracy better than 1 mm is 25, 100, 200 and 500 points respectively. Finally, we verified the tracking accuracy of this system using a specially designed ultrasound phantom. Since ultrasound images have a high noise level, we designed an ultrasound phantom that provides a large number of points for the calibration. This tissue equivalent phantom is made of nylon wires, and its room position is optically tracked using IRLEDs. By obtaining multiple images through the nylon wires, the calibration technique uses an average of 300 points for 3D ultrasound volumes and 200 for 2D ultrasound images, and its stability is very good for both rotation (standard deviation: 0.4{\'Y} ) and translation (standard deviation: 0.3 mm) transformations. After this initial calibration procedure, the position of any voxel in the ultrasound image volume can be determined in world space, thereby allowing real-time image guidance of therapeutic procedures. Finally, the overall tracking accuracy of our 3D ultrasound image-guided positioning system was measured to be on average 0.2 mm, 0.9 mm and 0.6 mm for the AP, lateral and axial directions respectively",

abstract="PURPOSE: Target sites affected by organ motion require a time resolved (4D) dose calculation. Typical 4D dose calculations use 4D-CT as a basis. Unfortunately, 4D-CT images have the disadvantage of being a ``snap-shot'' of the motion during acquisition and of assuming regularity of breathing. In addition, 4D-CT acquisitions involve a substantial additional dose burden to the patient making many, repeated 4D-CT acquisitions undesirable. Here the authors test the feasibility of an alternative approach to generate patient specific 4D-CT data sets. METHODS: In this approach motion information is extracted from 4D-MRI. Simulated 4D-CT data sets [which the authors call 4D-CT(MRI)] are created by warping extracted deformation fields to a static 3D-CT data set. The employment of 4D-MRI sequences for this has the advantage that no assumptions on breathing regularity are made, irregularities in breathing can be studied and, if necessary, many repeat imaging studies (and consequently simulated 4D-CT data sets) can be performed on patients and/or volunteers. The accuracy of 4D-CT(MRI)s has been validated by 4D proton dose calculations. Our 4D dose algorithm takes into account displacements as well as deformations on the originating 4D-CT/4D-CT(MRI) by calculating the dose of each pencil beam based on an individual time stamp of when that pencil beam is applied. According to corresponding displacement and density-variation-maps the position and the water equivalent range of the dose grid points is adjusted at each time instance. RESULTS: 4D dose distributions, using 4D-CT(MRI) data sets as input were compared to results based on a reference conventional 4D-CT data set capturing similar motion characteristics. Almost identical 4D dose distributions could be achieved, even though scanned proton beams are very sensitive to small differences in the patient geometry. In addition, 4D dose calculations have been performed on the same patient, but using 4D-CT(MRI) data sets based on variable breathing patterns to show the effect of possible irregular breathing on active scanned proton therapy. Using a 4D-CT(MRI), including motion irregularities, resulted in significantly different proton dose distributions. CONCLUSIONS: The authors have demonstrated that motion information from 4D-MRI can be used to generate realistic 4D-CT data sets on the basis of a single static 3D-CT data set. 4D-CT(MRI) presents a novel approach to test the robustness of treatment plans in the circumstance of patient motion",

abstract="The paper introduces a way to improve treatment planning of single-dose radiation therapy of liver tumors. Therefore, a new algorithm for the registration of diagnostic magnetic resonance images (MRI) and the computed tomography (CT) data used for treatment planning was developed. The described algorithm is divided into two stages. First, the two data sets are aligned by optimization of mutual information using rigid transformations. After this initial registration step, a nonrigid transformation based on thin-plate splines is performed, modeling the deformations of the soft tissue. An algorithm for automatic control point computation was developed, which is supposed to simplify the time-consuming task of defining the control points necessary for a thin-plate spline interpolation. The obtained results show that the implemented algorithm can successfully solve the registration problem",

abstract="A new approach is suggested for the optimization of stationary and more general moving beam type of irradiations. The method reverses the order of conventional treatment planning as it derives the optimum incident beam dose distributions from the desired dose distribution in the target volume. It is therefore deterministic and largely avoids the trial and error approach often applied in treatment planning of today. Based on the approximate spatial invariance of the convergent beam point irradiation dose distribution, the desired dose distribution in the target volume is analyzed in terms of the optimum density of such point irradiations. Since each point irradiation distribution is optimal for the irradiation of a given point and due to the linearity of individual energy depositions or absorbed dose contributions, the resultant point irradiation density will also generate the best possible irradiation of an extended target volume when the maximum absorbed dose at a certain distance from the target should be minimized. The optimum shape of the incident beam for each position of the gantry is obtained simply by inverse back projection of the point irradiation density on the position of the radiation source for that orientation of the incident beam",

abstract="Background The fast development of energy- and intensity-modulated radiation therapy during the last two decades using photon and electron beams has when implemented resulted in a considerable improvement of radiation therapy, particularly if combined with radiobiologically based treatment optimization techniques. This has made intensity-modulated electron and photon beams as powerful as today's uniform dose proton therapy. To be able to cure also the most advanced hypoxic and radiation-resistant tumors of complex local spread, intensity-modulated light ion beams are really the ultimate tool and in clinical practice 2 to 3 times less expensive per patient treated than proton therapy. This development and the recent development of advanced tumor diagnostics based on PET-CT imaging of the tumor cell density open the field for new powerful radiobiologically based treatment optimization methods. The ultimate step is to use the unique radiobiologic and dose distributional advantages of light ion beams for truly optimized bioeffect planning where the integral three-dimensional dose delivery and tumor cell survival can be monitored by PET-CT imaging and corrected by biologically based adaptive therapy optimization methods.Purpose The main purpose of the present paper is to discuss the principal areas of development of therapy optimization, by considering the therapy chain from tumor diagnostics and the use of three-dimensional predictive assay to biologically based treatment optimization with special focus on the rapid clinical development of advanced light ion therapy.Methods Besides the ``classical'' approaches using low ionization density hydrogen ions (protons, but also possibly deuterons and tritium nuclei) and high ionization density carbon ions, two new approaches will be discussed. In the first one, lithium or beryllium or boron ions, which induce the least detrimental biologic effect to normal tissues for a given biologic effect in a small volume of the tumor, will be key particles. In the second approach, referred patients will be given a high-dose, high-precision ``boost'' treatment with carbon or oxygen ions during 1 week preceding the final treatment with conventional radiation in the referring hospital. The rationale behind these approaches is to minimize the high ionization density dose to the normal-tissue stroma outside but sometimes also inside the tumor bed and to ensure a more uniform and optimal biologic effectiveness in the tumor, also on the microscopic scale. The present discussion indicates that BIologically Optimized predictive Assay based light ion Radiation Therapy (Bio-Art) is really the ultimate way to perform high-precision radiation therapy using checkpoints of the integral dose delivery and the tumor response and, based on this information, perform compensating corrections of the dose delivery. By using biologically optimized scanned high-energy photon or ion beams, it is possible to measure in vivo the three-dimensional dose delivery using the same PET-CT camera that was used for diagnosing the tumor spread. This method thus opens up the door for truly three-dimensional biologically optimized adaptive radiation therapy, where the measured dose delivery to the true target tissues can be used to fine-adjust the incoming beams, so that possible errors in the integral therapy process are eliminated toward the end of the treatment. Interestingly enough, practically all major error sources--such as organ motion, treatment planning errors, patient setup errors, and dose delivery problems due to gantry, multileaf, or scanning beam errors--can be corrected for in this way.Results and conclusions Radiobiologically optimized dose delivery using intensity and radiation quality modulation based on high-resolution PET-CT or Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI)-based tumor and normal-tissue imaging is probably the ultimate development of radiation therapy, taking the unique physical and biologic advantages of light ions fully into account in truly patient-individualized curative treatment schedules. Using recently available biologically based treatment optimization algorithms, it is possible to improve the treatment outcome for advanced tumors by as much as 10-40\%. The adaptive radiotherapy process based both on three-dimensional tumor cell survival and dose delivery monitoring has the potential of percent accuracy in tumor response and dose delivery monitoring, using two-dimensional, narrow high-energy photon beam scanning and three-dimensional 11C Bragg peak scanning for radiation quality and intensity-modulated dose delivery. There is no doubt that the future of radiation therapy is very promising, and gradually more and more patients may not even need advanced surgery. Instead, they could be cured by biologically optimized electron, photon, or light ion therapy, where the densely ionizing Bragg peak is placed solely in the gross tumor, and a lower ionization density is used in microscopically invasive tumor volumes",

abstract="BACKGROUND: In the treatment of prostate carcinoma, radiotherapy and surgery are common choices of comparable efficacy; thus a realistic comparison of the potential long term sequelae, such as the risk of second malignancy, may be of relevance to treatment choice. METHODS: Data regarding the rate of incidence from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program cancer registry (1973-1993) were used to compare directly second malignancy risks in 51,584 men with prostate carcinoma who received radiotherapy (3549 of whom developed second malignancies) with 70,539 men who underwent surgery without radiotherapy (5055 of whom developed second malignancies). Data were stratified by latency period, age at diagnosis, and site of the second malignancy. Directly comparing the risks in the radiotherapy group with those in the surgery group largely avoids problems associated with underreporting second malignancies. RESULTS: Radiotherapy for prostate carcinoma was associated with a small, statistically significant increase in the risk of solid tumors (6\%; P = 0.02) relative to treatment with surgery. Among patients who survived for >/= 5 years, the increased relative risk reached 15\%, and was 34\% for patients surviving >/= 10 years. The most significant contributors to the increased risk in the irradiated group were carcinomas of the bladder, rectum, and lung, and sarcomas within the treatment field. No significant increase in rates of leukemia was noted. CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy for prostate carcinoma was associated with a statistically significant, although fairly small, enhancement in the risk of second solid tumors, particularly for long term survivors. The pattern of excess second malignancies among men treated with radiotherapy was consistent with radiobiologic principles in terms of site, dose, and latency. In absolute terms, the estimated risk of developing a radiation-associated second malignancy was 1 in 290 for all prostate carcinoma patients treated with radiotherapy, increasing to 1 in 70 for long term survivors (>/= 10 years). Improvements in radiotherapeutic techniques, along with diagnosis at younger ages and earlier stages, are resulting in longer survival times for patients with prostate carcinoma. Because of the long latency period for radiation-induced tumors, this may result in radiation-related second malignancy risk becoming a more significant issue",

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate the magnitudes of the changes in mobility and volume of locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors during radiotherapy, using four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Five to ten 4DCT data sets were acquired weekly for each of 8 patients throughout treatment. Gross tumor volumes (GTVs) were outlined on each data set. Volumes and coordinates of the GTV centroids were calculated at the 0 (end-inspiration) and 50\% (end-expiration) respiration phases. Trends in magnitudes of intrafraction and interfraction positional variations were assessed for the GTV and internal target volume (ITV) during treatment. RESULTS: Tumor volume reduction ranged from 20\% to 71\% (end-inspiration) and from 15\% to 70\% (end-expiration). Increased tumor mobility was observed in the superior-inferior and anterior-posterior directions. However, no trends in tumor motion were observed. Motion along the superior-inferior direction was significantly greater (p < 0.001), with mean +/- SD values of 0.86 +/- 0.19 cm, as compared with 0.39 +/- 0.08 cm and 0.19 +/- 0.05 cm in the anterior-posterior and right-left directions, respectively. A marginally significant (p = 0.049) increase in total GTV positional variation was observed with increasing treatment weeks, and similar results were seen for the interfractional ITV mobility. CONCLUSIONS: Because of changes in tumor size and mobility, an explicit initial determination of the ITV may not be sufficient, especially where small setup margins are used. Repeat 4DCT scans might be warranted for highly mobile tumors to reduce the potential for missing the tumor",

abstract="PURPOSE: To assess the accuracy, reproducibility, and computational performance of deformable image registration algorithms under development at multiple institutions on common datasets. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Datasets from a lung patient (four-dimensional computed tomography [4D-CT]), a liver patient (4D-CT and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] at exhale), and a prostate patient (repeat MRI) were obtained. Radiation oncologists localized anatomic structures for accuracy assessment. Algorithm accuracy was determined by comparing the computer-predicted displacement at each bifurcation point with the displacement computed from the oncologists' annotations. Thirty-seven academic institutions and medical device manufacturers with published evidence of active deformable image registration capabilities were invited to participate. RESULTS: Twenty-seven groups agreed to participate; 6 did not return results. Sixteen completed the liver 4D-CT, 12 the lung 4D-CT, 3 the prostate MRI, and 3 the liver MRI-CT. The range of average absolute error for the lung 4D-CT was 0.6-1.2 mm (left-right [LR]), 0.5-1.8 mm (anterior-posterior [AP]), and 0.7-2.0 mm (superior-inferior [SI]); the liver 4D-CT was 0.8-1.5 mm (LR), 1.0-5.2 mm (AP), and 1.0-5.9 mm (SI); the liver MRI-CT was 1.1-2.6 mm (LR), 2.0-5.0 mm (AP), and 2.2-2.6 mm (SI); and the repeat prostate MRI prostate datasets was 0.5-6.2 mm (LR), 3.1-3.7 mm (AP), and 0.4-2.0 mm (SI). CONCLUSIONS: An infrastructure was developed to assess multi-institution deformable registration accuracy. The results indicate large discrepancies in reported shifts, although the majority of deformable registration algorithms performed at an accuracy equivalent to the voxel size, promising to improve treatment planning, delivery, and assessment",

Using adaptive techniques to tailor treatment margins to reflect patient-specific breathing motions and image-guidance techniques can reduce the high dose delivered to surrounding normal tissues while ensuring that the prescription dose is delivered to the tumor. Several treatment planning and delivery techniques have been developed for use in the liver, including a margin to encompass the full breathing motion, mean position techniques, which evaluate the probability of tumor location during breathing, breath hold, gating, and tracking.

abstract="PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to determine if image-guided robotic stereotactic radiosurgery by CyberKnife Radiosurgery System using ablative radiation doses achieves acceptable local control in medically inoperable patients with early non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to evaluate disease-free survival, toxicity, and failure. CyberKnife can deliver the prescribed dose by using many different angles converging on the target, with real-time target tracking through a combined orthogonal radiograph imaging and optic motion tracking system (Synchrony). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of treatment details and outcomes for 59 patients, ranging in age from 51 years to 96 years, with 61 tumors with histologically proven cancers treated by image-guided robotic stereotactic radiosurgery at the CyberKnife Center of Miami between March 2004 and March 2007 is presented. Target localization and respiratory movement compensation were accomplished using a single fiducial marker placed within the tumor, and the X-Sight and Synchrony systems. Total doses ranged from 15 Gy to 67.5 Gy delivered in 1-5 fractions with an equivalent dose range of 24-110 Gy normalized treatment dose in 2 Gy fractions (alpha/beta = 20 Gy). RESULTS: Four patients with stage 1A NSCLC and 2 patients with stage 1B NSCLC had persistent or recurrent disease. All patients tolerated the radiosurgery well, fatigue being the main side effect. Of the 59 patients treated, 51 (86\%) were still alive at 1-33-month follow-up. Eight patients have died, 2 of diseases other than cancer progression. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the delivery of precisely targeted ablative radiation doses with surgical precision to limited treatment volumes of lung tumors in a hypofractionated fashion is feasible and safe. Image-guided robotic stereotactic radiosurgery of lung tumors with CyberKnife(R) achieves excellent rates of local disease control with limited toxicity to surrounding tissues and, in many cases, might be curative for patients for whom surgery is not an option",

abstract="OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of using image-guided robotic stereotactic radioablation as an alternative treatment modality for patients with surgically resectable, but medically inoperable, T1 N0 M0, stage IA non-small cell lung cancer. METHODS: Between January 2004 and May 2006, 19 patients, 11 women and 8 men ranging in age from 52 to 88 years, with stage IA non-small cell lung cancer were treated. Tumor volume ranged from 1.7 to 13 mL. Total doses ranged from 24 to 60 Gy delivered in 3 fractions. Eleven patients received 60 Gy. Real-time target localization was accomplished by radiographic detection of fiducial marker(s) implanted within the tumor combined with respiratory motion tracking. RESULTS: All patients tolerated radioablation well with fatigue as the main side effect. Fourteen patients are alive from 1 to 25 months posttreatment. Four patients died: 2 of comorbid disease and 2 of cancer progression (status post 60 and 55.5 Gy). Three patients developed grade I radiation pneumonitis. Two patients have stable disease. In 3 patients, cancer recurred in the planning treatment volume: in 2 patients after treatment with 60 Gy and in 1 patient after treatment with 55.5 Gy. One patient had local control in the target volume but developed metastasis to the ipsilateral hilum. Nine patients had a complete response and show no evidence of disease. CONCLUSIONS: In our early experience, stereotactic radioablation using the CyberKnife system appears to be a safe, minimally invasive, and effective modality for treating early stage lung cancer in patients with medically inoperable disease. Dose escalation and/or increasing the treatment volumes, with the aid of the high conformality of this technique, may help to achieve further improvements in these promising results",

abstract="PURPOSE: Maximal therapeutic gain in xenograft sarcoma and toxicity for jejunal mucosa is time dependent for concurrent gemcitabine and radiotherapy (RT). We used a time-dependent schedule to determine the maximal-tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs; Grade 4 hematologic or Grade 3 other toxicity). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with pancreatic cancer (n = 33), periampullary carcinoma (n = 1), or bile duct cancer (n = 2) were treated with 3-day conformal RT with 50.4 Gy (tumor, lymphatics) plus a 5.4-Gy boost. Concurrent cisplatin (20 mg/m(2)/d on Days 1-5 and 29-33) and gemcitabine (initially 600 mg/m(2), weekly on Fridays 68 h before RT) were administered. Because of DLT, the doses were reduced to 500 mg/m(2) weekly and then 500, 400, or 300 mg/m(2) on Days 2, 5, 26, 33. RESULTS: DLT occurred at all dose levels of gemcitabine >300 mg/m(2). Fourteen patients were treated at the recommended Phase II dose of gemcitabine (300 mg/m(2)) without DLT. The response to chemoradiation allowed 10 of 30 initially unresectable patients with primary pancreatic carcinoma to undergo radical surgery, including a complete response in 2 cases. CONCLUSIONS: At the recommended Phase II dose, chemoradiation with gemcitabine and cisplatin can be administered safely in pancreatic carcinoma. However, at higher dose levels, toxicity is severe and frequent. Patients with a chance for conversion to resection could benefit from this schedule",

abstract="PURPOSE: Determination of the impact of the filling status of the organs at risk (bladder and rectum) on the uterus mobility and on their integral dose distribution in radiotherapy of gynaecological cancer. METHODS: In 29 women suffering from cervical or endometrial cancer two CT scans were carried out for treatment planning, one with an empty bladder and rectum, the second one with bladder and rectum filled. The volumes of the organs at risk were calculated and in 14 patients, receiving a definitive radiotherapy, the position of the uterus within the pelvis was shown using multiplanar reconstructions. After generation of a 3D treatment plan the dose volume histograms were compared for empty and filled organs at risk. RESULTS: The mobility for the corpus uteri with/without bladder and rectum filling was in median 7 mm (95\%-confidence interval: 3-15 mm) in cranial/caudal direction and 4 mm (0-9 mm) in posterior/anterior direction. Likewise, cervical mobility was observed to be 4 mm (-1-6 mm) mm in cranial/caudal direction. A full bladder led to a mean reduction in organ dose in median from 94-87\% calculated for 50\% of the bladder volume (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon's matched-pairs signed-ranks test). For 66\% of the bladder volume the dose could be reduced in median from 78 to 61\% (P < 0.005) and for the whole bladder from 42 to 39\% (P < 0.005), respectively. No significant contribution of the filling status of the rectum to its integral dose burden was noticed. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the mobility of the uterus increased margins between CTV and PTV superiorly, inferiorly, anteriorly and posteriorly of 15, 6 and 9 mm each, respectively, should be used. A full bladder is the prerequisite for an integral dose reduction",

abstract="As nonpharmacologic therapies for atrial fibrillation expand, the complexity of the anatomical and electrical substrates of atrial fibrillation requires integration of multiple imaging modalities for successful treatment. Combining chamber-specific imaging and electrophysiologic data points during ablation therapy has improved pulmonary vein isolation accuracy while diminishing risk. Merging 3-dimensional computed tomography left atrial renditions, intracardiac echocardiography, and electroanatomical mapping during pulmonary vein isolation is a reality that relates the complex anatomy of the left atrium to its often variable electrical targets. Direct visualization of radiofrequency lesion formation as well as electrode-tissue contact during current delivery has been accomplished in animal models using ultrasound and infrared imaging tools. The combination of these early integrative stepping stones may lead to imaging with real-time feedback relating tissue desiccation to electrical effect and lesion transmurality. Atrial fibrillation ablation outcome will improve as the electrophysiology laboratory continues to integrate real-time 3-dimensional cardiac chamber and tissue images before, during, and after radiofrequency or cryoablation of specific electrophysiologic targets",

abstract="PURPOSE: To assess the potential reduction of small bowel volume receiving high-dose radiation by using kilovoltage X-ray cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and quantized margin selection for adaptive bladder cancer treatment. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty bladder patients were planned conformally using a four-field, 15-mm uniform margin technique. Two additional planning target volumes (PTVs) were created using margins quantized to 5 and 10 mm in the superior direction only. CBCTs (approximately 8 scans/patient) were acquired during treatment. CBCT volumes were registered with CT planning scans to determine setup errors and to select the appropriate PTV of the day. Margin reduction in other directions was considered. Outlining of small bowel in every fraction is required to properly quantify the volume of small bowel spared from high doses. In the case of CBCT this is not always possible owing to artifacts created by small bowel movement and the presence of gas. A simpler method was adopted by considering the volume difference between PTVs created using uniform and adapted margins, which corresponds to the potential volume of small bowel sparing. RESULTS: The average small bowel volume that can be spared by this form of adaptive radiotherapy is 31 +/- 23 cm3 (+/-1 SD). The bladder for 1 patient was systematically smaller than the planning scan and hence demonstrated the largest average reduction of 76 cm3. The clinical target volume to PTV margins in other directions can be safely reduced to 10 mm except in the anterior direction where, like the superior direction, the bladder showed significant variation. CONCLUSIONS: Online CBCT-assisted plan selection based on quantized margins can significantly reduce the volume of small bowel receiving high doses for some bladder patients. CBCT allows the 15-mm margins used in some directions to be safely reduced to 10 mm",

Cirrhotic patients were eligible if they had a Child-Pugh score of 10 or less. Eligible patients included those with T 1 -T 3 hepatocellular carcinoma; selected T 4 patients also were eligible. Patients with lymph node or distant metastases were ineligible. Daily proton beam radiotherapy was directed to the liver tumor with an additional 1-2 cm margin. The total dose was 63 cobalt Gray equivalents, administered in 15 divided fractions over 3 weeks. Thirty-four patients have completed treatment and have been followed up for a minimum of 6 months, with a median follow-up period of 20 months. The mean age was 65 years, and average tumor size was 5.7 cm. Posttreatment toxicity included a small but significant decline in albumin levels and increased total bilirubin; 3 experienced duodenal or colonic bleeding when bowel was immediately adjacent to the treated tumor. Two-year actuarial data showed a 75\% local tumor control rate and an overall survival rate of 55\%. Of patients with an elevated pretreatment alpha-fetoprotein, 85\% were found to have declining alpha-fetoprotein levels from a pretreatment mean of 1405 to 35 at 6 months after treatment. Six patients underwent liver transplantation between 6 and 16 months after completion of radiotherapy with 2 showing no evidence of residual carcinoma within the explanted liver. Overall the majority of patients responded to treatment, and the therapy was well tolerated",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Proton beam therapy (PBT) may provide useful local-regional treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PBT for HCC. METHODS: Patients with cirrhosis who had radiological features or biopsy-proven HCC were included in the study. Patients without cirrhosis and patients with extrahepatic metastasis were excluded. The mean age was 62.7 years. The mean tumor size was 5.5 cm. Eleven patients had multiple tumors, and 46\% were within the Milan criteria. Patients received 63 Gy delivered over a 3-week period with PBT. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients were treated and followed prospectively for treatment outcomes at Loma Linda University Medical Center. Acute toxicity was minimal; all patients completed the full course of treatment. Radiation-induced liver disease was evaluated using liver enzyme, bilirubin, and albumin levels; no significant change supervened 6 months posttreatment. Median progression-free survival for the entire group was 36 months, with a 60\% 3-year progression-free survival rate for patients within the Milan criteria. Eighteen patients subsequently underwent liver transplantation; 6 (33\%) explants showed pathological complete response and 7 (39\%) showed only microscopic residual. CONCLUSIONS: PBT was found to be a safe and effective local-regional therapy for inoperable HCC. A randomized controlled trial to compare its efficacy to a standard therapy has been initiated.

Design: A prospective phase 2 clinical trial. Setting: Loma Linda University Medical Center. Patients: Subjects with clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer who were medically inoperable or refused surgery. Interventions: All patients were treated with proton beam radiotherapy. The target included the gross tumor volume as seen on CT scan, with additional margin to allow for respiratory motion. A multibeam treatment plan was generated. Delivered treatment was 51 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) in 10 fractions over 2 weeks to the initial 22 patients; the subsequent 46 patients received 60 CGE in 10 fractions over 2 weeks. Results: Sixty-eight patients were analyzed for this report, with a median follow-up time of 30 months. No cases of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis or late esophageal or cardiac toxicity were seen. The 3-year local control and disease-specific survival rates were 74\%, and 72\%, respectively. There was significant improvement in local tumor control in T1 vs T2 tumors (87\% vs 49\%), with a trend toward improved survival. Cox regression analysis revealed that patients with higher performance status, female gender, and smaller tumor sizes had significantly improved survival. Conclusion: High-dose hypofractionated proton beam radiotherapy can be administered safely, with minimal toxicity, to patients with stage I lung cancer. Local tumor control appears to be improved when compared to historical results utilizing conventional radiotherapy, with a good expectation of disease-specific survival 3 years following treatment",

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate the dosimetric impact of rotational setup errors in stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) treatment of liver tumors and to investigate whether translational shifts can compensate for rotation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The positioning accuracy in 20 patients with liver malignancies treated with SBRT was reevaluated offline by matching the patients' cone-beam computed tomography (CT) scans (n=75) to the planning CT scans and adjusting the 3 rotational angles (pitch, roll, and yaw). Systematic and random setup errors were calculated. The dosimetric changes caused by rotational setup errors were quantified for both simulated and observed patient rotations. Dose distributions recalculated on the rotated CT scans were compared with the original planned doses. Translational corrections were simulated based on manual translational registration of the rotated images to the original CT scans. The correction efficacy was evaluated by comparing the recalculated plans with the original plans. RESULTS: The systematic rotational setup errors were -0.06 degrees +/- 0.68 degrees , -0.29 degrees +/- 0.62 degrees , and -0.24 degrees +/- 0.61 degrees ; the random setup errors were 0.80 degrees , 1.05 degrees , and 0.61 degrees for pitch, roll, and yaw, respectively. Analysis of CBCT images showed that 56.0\%, 14.7\%, and 1.3\% of treated fractions had rotational errors of >1 degrees , >2 degrees , and >3 degrees , respectively, in any one of the rotational axes. Rotational simulations demonstrated that the reduction of gross tumor volume (GTV) coverage was <2\% when rotation was <3 degrees . Recalculated plans using actual patient roll motions showed similar reduction (<2\%) in GTV coverage. Translational corrections improved the GTV coverage to within 3\% of the original values. For organs at risk (OAR), the dosimetric impact varied case by case. CONCLUSION: Actual rotational setup errors in SBRT for liver tumors are relatively small in magnitude and are unlikely to affect GTV coverage significantly. Translational corrections can be optimized to compensate for rotational setup errors. However, caution regarding possible dose increases to OAR needs to be exercised",

abstract="PURPOSE: Beam angle optimization (BAO) by far remains an important and challenging problem in external beam radiation therapy treatment planning. Conventional BAO algorithms discussed in previous studies all focused on photon-based therapies. Impact of BAO on proton therapy is important while proton therapy increasingly receives great interests. This study focuses on potential benefits of BAO on intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) that recently began available to clinical cancer treatment. METHODS: The authors have developed a novel uncertainty incorporated BAO algorithm for IMPT treatment planning in that IMPT plan quality is highly sensitive to uncertainties such as proton range and setup errors. A linear programming was used to optimize robust intensity maps to scenario-based uncertainties for an incident beam angle configuration. Unlike conventional intensity-modulated radiation therapy with photons (IMXT), the search space for IMPT treatment beam angles may be relatively small but optimizing an IMPT plan may require higher computational costs due to larger data size. Therefore, a deterministic local neighborhood search algorithm that only needs a very limited number of plan objective evaluations was used to optimize beam angles in IMPT treatment planning. RESULTS: Three prostate cancer cases and two skull base chordoma cases were studied to demonstrate the dosimetric advantages and robustness of optimized beam angles from the proposed BAO algorithm. Two- to four-beam plans were optimized for prostate cases, and two- and three-beam plans were optimized for skull base cases. By comparing plans with conventional two parallel-opposed angles, all plans with optimized angles consistently improved sparing at organs at risks, i.e., rectum and femoral heads for prostate, brainstem for skull base, in either nominal dose distribution or uncertainty-based dose distributions. The efficiency of the BAO algorithm was demonstrated by comparing it with alternative methods including simulated annealing and genetic algorithm. The numbers of IMPT plan objective evaluations required were reduced by up to a factor of 5 while the same optimal angle plans were converged in selected comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Uncertainty incorporated BAO may introduce pronounced improvement of IMPT plan quality including dosimetric benefits and robustness over uncertainties, based on the five clinical studies in this paper. In addition, local search algorithms may be more efficient in finding optimal beam angles than global optimization approaches for IMPT BAO",

abstract="BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to conduct a worldwide survey investigating the methods, efficacy, and safety of catheter ablation (CA) of atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS AND RESULTS: A detailed questionnaire was sent to 777 centers worldwide. Data relevant to the study purpose were collected from 181 centers, of which 100 had ongoing programs on CA of AF between 1995 and 2002. The number of patients undergoing this procedure increased from 18 in 1995 to 5050 in 2002. The median number of procedures per center was 37.5 (range, 1 to 600). Paroxysmal AF, persistent AF, and permanent AF were the indicated arrhythmias in 100.0\%, 53.0\%, and 20.0\% of responding centers, respectively. The most commonly used techniques were right atrial compartmentalization between 1995 and 1997, ablation of the triggering focus in 1998 and 1999, and electrical disconnection of multiple pulmonary veins between 2000 and 2002. Of 8745 patients completing the CA protocol in 90 centers, of whom 2389 (27.3\%) required >1 procedure, 4550 (52.0\%; range among centers, 14.5\% to 76.5\%) became asymptomatic without drugs and another 2094 (23.9\%; range among centers, 8.8\% to 50.3\%) became asymptomatic in the presence of formerly ineffective antiarrhythmic drugs over an 11.6+/-7.7-month follow-up period. At least 1 major complication was reported in 524 patients (6.0\%). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this survey provide a picture of the variable and evolving methods, efficacy, and safety of CA for AF as practiced in a large number of centers worldwide and may serve as a guide to clinicians considering therapeutic options in patients suffering from this arrhythmia",

abstract="Purpose: The formulation of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for high linear energy transfer (high-LET) radiation treatments is revisited. The effects of changed production of sub-lethal damage with varying LET is now considered via the RBEmin concept, where RBEmin represents the lower limit to which RBE tends at high doses per fraction. Materials and methods: An existing linear-quadratic formulation for calculating RBE variations with fractional dose for high-LET radiations is modified to incorporate the twin concepts of RBEmax (which represents the value of RBE at an effective dose-per-fraction of 0 Gy) and RBEmin. Results: Fits of the model to data showed RBEmin values in the range of 0.1 - 2.27. In all cases the raw data was a better statistical fit to the model which included RBEmin, although this was only very highly significant in one case. In the case of the mouse oesophagus it is shown that, if change in the ?-radiosensitivity coefficient with LET is considered as trivial, an underestimation >5\% in RBE can be expected at X-ray doses of 2 Gy/fraction if RBEmin is not considered. To ensure that the results were not biased by the statistical method used to obtain the parameter values relevant to this analysis (i.e., using fraction-size effect or Fe-plots), an alternative method was used which provided very similar correlation with the data. Conclusions: If the production of sublethal damage is considered independent of LET, there will be a risk that non-corrected evaluation of RBE will lead to an over- or under-estimate of RBE at low doses per fractions (the clinically relevant region).",

abstract="PURPOSE: The inter- and intrafraction variability of liver position was assessed in patients with liver cancer treated with kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 314 CBCT scans obtained in the treatment position immediately before and after each fraction were evaluated from 29 patients undergoing six-fraction, non-breath-hold stereotactic body radiotherapy for unresectable liver cancer. Off-line, the CBCT scans were sorted into 10 bins, according to the phase of respiration. The liver position (relative to the vertebral bodies) was measured using rigid alignment of the exhale CBCT liver with the exhale planning CT liver, following the alignment of the vertebrae. The interfraction liver position change was measured by comparing the pretreatment CBCT scans, and the intrafraction change was measured from the CBCT scans obtained immediately before and after each fraction. RESULTS: The mean amplitude of liver motion for all patients was 1.8 mm (range, 0.1-5.7), 8.0 mm (range, 0.1-18.8), and 4.3 mm (range 0.1-12.1) in the medial-lateral (ML), craniocaudal (CC), and anteroposterior (AP) directions, respectively. The mean absolute ML, CC, and AP interfraction changes in liver position were 2.0 mm (90th percentile, 4.2), 3.5 mm (90th percentile, 7.3), and 2.3 mm (90th percentile, 4.7). The mean absolute intrafraction ML, CC, and AP changes were 1.3 mm (90th percentile, 2.9), 1.6 mm (90th percentile, 3.6), and 1.5 mm (90th percentile, 3.1), respectively. The interfraction changes were significantly larger than the intrafraction changes, with a CC systematic error of 2.9 and 1.1 mm, respectively. The intraobserver reproducibility (sigma, n = 29 fractions) was 1.3 mm in the ML, 1.4 mm in the CC, and 1.6 mm in the AP direction. CONCLUSION: Interfraction liver position changes relative to the vertebral bodies are an important source of geometric uncertainty, providing a rationale for prefraction soft-tissue image guidance. The intrafraction change in liver position from the beginning to the end of each fraction was small for most patients",

abstract="PURPOSE: Interfraction and intrafraction changes in amplitude of liver motion were assessed in patients with liver cancer treated with kV cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 314 CBCTs obtained with the patient in the treatment position immediately before and after each fraction, and 29 planning 4DCTs were evaluated in 29 patients undergoing six-fraction SBRT for unresectable liver cancer, with (n = 15) and without (n = 14) abdominal compression. Offline, the CBCTs were sorted into 10 bins, based on phase of respiration. Liver motion amplitude was measured using liver-to-liver alignment from the end-exhale and end-inhale CBCT and four-dimensional CT reconstructions. Inter- and intrafraction amplitude changes were measured from the difference between the pre-SBRT CBCTs relative to the planning four-dimensional CT, and from the pre-SBRT and post-SBRT CBCTs, respectively. RESULTS: Mean liver motion amplitude for all patients (range) was 1.8 (0.1-7.0), 8.0 (0.1-18.8), and 4.3 (0.1-12.1) mm in the mediolateral (ML), craniocaudal (CC), and anteroposterior (AP) directions, respectively. Mean absolute inter- and intrafraction liver motion amplitude changes were 1.0 (ML), 1.7 (CC), and 1.6 (AP) mm and 1.3 (ML), 1.6 (CC), and 1.9 (AP) mm, respectively. No significant correlations were found between intrafraction amplitude change and intrafraction time (range, 4:56-25:37 min:sec), and between inter- and intrafraction amplitude changes and liver motion amplitude. Intraobserver reproducibility (sigma, n = 29 fractions) was 1.3 (ML), 1.4 (CC), and 1.4 (AP) mm. CONCLUSIONS: For the majority of liver SBRT patients, the change in liver motion amplitude was minimal over the treatment course and showed no apparent relationships with the magnitude of liver motion and intrafraction time",

abstract="Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in head and neck (H\&N) cancer has the capability to generate steep dose gradients, leading to an improved therapeutic index. IMRT plans are typically based on a pretreatment computed tomography scan that provides a snapshot of the patient's anatomy. Nevertheless, interfractional patient variations may occur because of setup error and anatomical modifications. Therefore, the accuracy of IMRT delivery for H\&N cancer may be compromised during the treatment course, potentially affecting the therapeutic index. In this framework, adaptive radiotherapy is a potential solution, which consists of ``the explicit inclusion of the temporal changes in anatomy during the imaging, planning, and delivery of radiotherapy.'' Adaptive radiotherapy has brought an additional dimension to the management of patients with H\&N cancer and has the potential to counteract the effects of positioning errors and anatomical changes. This article reviews the causes and discusses potential solutions to circumvent the discrepancies between the planned dose and the actual dose received by patients treated for H\&N malignancies",

The particles utilized have included helium, primarily of interest because of improved dose distributions with reduction of dose to adjacent normal tissues, and heavier particles such as carbon, neon and argon ions which have the additional potential of increased biologic effectiveness against the tumor, especially hypoxic tumor cells. Initial results with helium particles have been sufficiently good to warrant a Phase III randomized trial in carcinoma of the pancreas; in other tumor sites, and with other particles, Phase I -- Phase II studies are in progress. Although follow-up is short, control within the irradiated area in this heterogeneous group of patients appears at least as good as with current megavoltage irradiation and complications to date are acceptably low, warranting further studies with heavy charged particles"

Biologically, carbon, neon, and other heavy ion beams (up to about silicon) are clinically useful in overcoming the radioresistance of hypoxic tumors, thus increasing the biological effectiveness relative to low linear energy transfer x-ray or electron beams. Cells irradiated by heavy ions show less variation in cell-cycle-related radiosensitivity and decreased repair of radiation injury.

abstract="PURPOSE: Tumor motion due to patient breathing is a factor that limits the accuracy of dose distribution in radiotherapy. One of the methods to improve the accuracy is by applying respiratory gating or tumor tracking. Both techniques require a precise determination of the spatial location of the tumor. We present an experimental evaluation of the performance of PeTrack, a technique that can track internal fiducial markers in real-time for tumor tracking. METHODS: PeTrack uses position sensitive detectors to record annihilation coincidence gamma rays from fiducial positron emission markers implanted in or around the tumor. It uses an expectation-maximization clustering algorithm to track the position of the markers. A normalized least mean square adaptive filter was used to predict the position of the markers 100 and 200 ms in the future. We evaluated the performance of the tracking and of the prediction by using a dynamic anthropomorphic thorax phantom to generate three-dimensional (3D) motion of three fiducial markers. The algorithm was run with four different data sets. In the first run, the motion of the markers was based on a sinusoidal model of respiratory motion. Three additional runs were done with motion based on patient breathing data. RESULTS: In the case of the sinusoidal model, the average 3D root mean square error for all markers was 0.44 mm. For the three runs based on patient breathing data, the precision of the 3D localization was 0.49 mm. At a latency of 100 ms, the average 3D prediction error was 1.3 +/- 0.6 mm for the sinusoidal model and for the three patient breathing runs. At a latency of 200 ms, the average 3D prediction errors were 1.7 +/- 0.8 mm for the sinusoidal model and 1.4 +/- 0.7 mm for the breathing runs. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that PeTrack can track multiple fiducial markers in real-time with an accuracy and precision smaller than 2 mm. PeTrack can have a direct application in tumor tracking for radiation therapy",

abstract="PURPOSE: The NOMOS (Sewickley, PA) B-mode Acquisition and Targeting System (BAT) ultrasound system provides a rapid means of correcting for interfraction prostate positional variation. In this investigation, we report our experience on the clinical issues relevant to the daily use of the BAT system and the analysis of combined setup error and organ motion for 3509 BAT alignment procedures in 147 consecutive patients treated with IMRT for prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: After setup to external skin marks, therapists performed the BAT ultrasound alignment procedure before each IMRT treatment. In this study, a single physician (A.C.) reviewed all BAT images and classified image quality and accuracy of image alignment by the therapist. On a scale of 1-3, near-perfect image quality or alignment was given a 1, fair image quality or misalignment > or = 5 mm (likely within the PTV) was given a 2, and unacceptable image quality or misalignment >5 mm (potential to violate the PTV) was given a value of 3. The distribution of shifts made was analyzed in each dimension and for all patients. The time required to perform the BAT alignment was also assessed in 17 patients. RESULTS: Among the 3509 attempted BAT procedures, the image quality was judged to be poor or unacceptable in 5.1\% (181). Of the remaining 3328 BAT images, with quality scores of 1-2, alignments were unacceptable (>5 mm misalignment as judged by the reviewing physician) in 3\% (100). The mean shift in each direction, averaged over all patients, was 0.5-0.7 mm. Interfraction standard deviation (1 SD) of prostate position based on combined setup error and internal organ motion is 4.9 mm, 4.4 mm, and 2.8 mm in the anteroposterior (AP), superior-inferior (SI), and lateral (RL) dimensions, respectively. The distribution of the shifts was a near-random Gaussian-type in all three major axes, with greater variations in AP and SI directions. The percent of BAT procedures in which the shift was >5 mm was 28.6\% in AP, 23\% in SI, and 9\% in RL directions. The average BAT procedure took extra 5 min out of a 20-min time slot in a typical eight-field IMRT treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of the daily ultrasound images was deemed acceptable in 95\%. Major alignment errors by therapists were only 3\%. The BAT system is clinically effective and feasible in a matter of 5 min. Although the accuracy of the BAT was not addressed in this investigation, we found a significant percentage of large shifts being made from the initial alignment position",

abstract="Local failure of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) radiotherapy may cause continuous tumor seeding and death. Radiotherapy dose escalation has been shown to improve local control and survival. However, the toxicities associated with dose escalation are significant and limit the potential of dose escalation. Intensity modulated radio-therapy (IMRT) may have the potential to improve the therapeutic ratio for photon treatment of lung cancer by sparing surrounding normal tissues. However, low-dose exposure to normal lung and organ motion is a major concern. We have conducted several studies to address these issues and started clinical studies to evaluate the potential benefit of IMRT in patients with NSCLC. Proton radiotherapy may have greater potential to spare normal tissue and allow for further dose escalation and acceleration. We are conducting preclinical and clinical studies for imaging-guided proton radiotherapy in NSCLC. In this paper, we discuss the preliminary data, IMRT treatment guidelines, and ongoing studies for proton therapy in NSCLC",

abstract="We have previously described a low-dose megavoltage cone beam computed tomography (MV CBCT) system capable of producing projection image using one beam pulse. In this study, we report on its integration with respiratory gating for gated radiotherapy. The respiratory gating system tracks a reflective marker on the patient's abdomen midway between the xiphoid and umbilicus, and disables radiation delivery when the marker position is outside predefined thresholds. We investigate two strategies for acquiring gated scans. In the continuous rotation-gated acquisition, the linear accelerator (LINAC) is set to the fixed x-ray mode and the gantry makes a 5 min, 360 degree continuous rotation, during which the gating system turns the radiation beam on and off, resulting in projection images with an uneven distribution of projection angles (e.g., in 70 arcs each covering 2 degrees). In the gated rotation-continuous acquisition, the LINAC is set to the dynamic arc mode, which suspends the gantry rotation when the gating system inhibits the beam, leading to a slightly longer (6-7 min) scan time, but yielding projection images with more evenly distributed projection angles (e.g., approximately 0.8 degrees between two consecutive projection angles). We have tested both data acquisition schemes on stationary (a contrast detail and a thoracic) phantoms and protocol lung patients. For stationary phantoms, a separate motion phantom not visible in the images is used to trigger the RPM system. Frame rate is adjusted so that approximately 450 images (13 MU) are acquired for each scan and three-dimensional tomographic images reconstructed using a Feldkamp filtered backprojection algorithm. The gated rotation-continuous acquisition yield reconstructions free of breathing artifacts. The tumor in parenchymal lung and normal tissues are easily discernible and the boundary between the diaphragm and the lung sharply defined. Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) is not degraded relative to nongated scans of stationary phantoms. The continuous rotation-gated acquisition scan also yields tomographic images with discernible anatomic features; however, streak artifacts are observed and CNR is reduced by approximately a factor of 4. In conclusion, we have successfully developed a gated MV CBCT system to verify the patient positioning for gated radiotherapy",

abstract="One of the many challenges of lung cancer radiotherapy is conforming the radiation dose to the target due to tumor/organ motion and the need to spare surrounding critical structures. Evolving radiotherapy technologies, such as four-dimensional (4-D) image-based motion management, daily on-board imaging and adaptive radiotherapy, have enabled us to improve the therapeutic index of radiation therapy for lung cancer by permitting the design of personalized treatments that deliver adequate doses conforming to the target while sparing the surrounding critical normal tissues. Four-dimensional computed tomography (CT) image-based motion management provides an opportunity to individualize target motion margins and reduce the risk of a geographical target miss. Daily on-board imaging and adaptive radiotherapy reduce set-up and motion/anatomy uncertainties over the course of radiotherapy. These achievements in image guidance have permitted the implementation in lung cancer patients of highly conformal treatment delivery techniques that are exquisitely sensitive to organ motion and anatomic change such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy, stereotactic body radiation therapy, and proton therapy. More clinical studies are needed to further optimize conformal radiotherapy using individualized treatment adaptations based on changes in anatomy and tumor motion during the course of radiotherapy and using functional and biological imaging to selectively escalate doses to radioresistant subregions within the tumor",

abstract="PURPOSE: We performed a complete pathologic analysis examining extracapsular extension (ECE) and microscopic spread of malignant cells beyond the prostate capsule to determine whether and when clinical target volume (CTV) expansion should be performed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A detailed pathologic analysis was performed for 371 prostatectomy specimens. All slides from each case were reviewed by a single pathologist (N.S.G.). The ECE status and ECE distance, defined as the maximal linear radial distance of malignant cells beyond the capsule, were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 121 patients (33\%) were found to have ECE (68 unilateral, 53 bilateral). Median ECE distance=2.4 mm [range: 0.05-7.0 mm]. The 90th-percentile distance = 5.0 mm. Of the 121 cases with ECE, 55\% had ECE distance>or=2 mm, 19\%>or=4 mm, and 6\%>or=6 mm. ECE occurred primarily posterolaterally along the neurovascular bundle in all cases. Pretreatment prostrate-specific antigen (PSA), biopsy Gleason, pathologic Gleason, clinical stage, bilateral involvement, positive margins, percentage of gland involved, and maximal tumor dimension were associated with presence of ECE. Both PSA and Gleason score were associated with ECE distance. In all 371 patients, for those with either pretreatment PSA>or=10 or biopsy Gleason score>or=7, 21\% had ECE>or=2 mm and 5\%>or=4 mm beyond the capsule. For patients with both of these risk factors, 49\% had ECE>or=2 mm and 21\%>or=4 mm. CONCLUSIONS: For prostate cancer with ECE, the median linear distance of ECE was 2.4 mm and occurred primarily posterolaterally. Although only 5\% of patients demonstrate ECE>4 to 5 mm beyond the capsule, this risk may exceed 20\% in patients with PSA>or=10 ng/ml and biopsy Gleason score>or=7. As imaging techniques improve for prostate capsule delineation and as radiotherapy delivery techniques increase in accuracy, a posterolateral CTV expansion should be considered for patients at high risk",

abstract="Fast radiological range adaptation of the ion beam is essential when target motion is mitigated by beam tracking using scanned ion beams for dose delivery. Electromagnetically controlled deflection of a well-focused ion beam on a small static wedge degrader positioned between two dipole magnets, inside the beam delivery system, has been considered as a fast range adaptation method. The principle of the range adaptation method was tested in experiments and Monte Carlo simulations for the therapy beam line at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ions Research. Based on the simulations, ion optical settings of beam deflection and realignment of the adapted beam were experimentally applied to the beam line, and additional tuning was manually performed. Different degrader shapes were employed for the energy adaptation. Measured and simulated beam profiles, i.e. lateral distribution and range in water at isocentre, were analysed and compared with the therapy beam values for beam scanning. Deflected beam positions of up to +/-28 mm on degrader were performed which resulted in a range adaptation of up to +/-15 mm water equivalence (WE). The maximum deviation between the measured adapted range from the nominal range adaptation was below 0.4 mm WE. In experiments, the width of the adapted beam at the isocentre was adjustable between 5 and 11 mm full width at half maximum. The results demonstrate the feasibility/proof of the proposed range adaptation method for beam tracking from the beam quality point of view",

abstract="Purpose: Medical physics aspects of gated irradiation to moving tumors using scanned ion beams. Methods: At our institute, more than 700 patients have been treated with proton and carbon ion beams since its start. The first patient has now been treated with the application of gating. For this purpose, the Anzai respiratory motion detection and gating system was interfaced with the treatment control system such as to control spill pausing. The patient presented with a liver tumor moving with peak-to-peak amplitude of {\textasciitilde}1cm due to breathing. Treatment planning was performed using the Siemens Syngo RT-Planning system on a 3DCT dataset. The gating window was determined from 4DCT. Plan verification was performed in a motion phantom, consisting of a PMMA block equipped with a 3D set of 24 pinpoint chambers mounted on the Quasar moving platform. The breathing motion perpendicular to the beam was simulated based on the trajectory obtained from the Anzai system during 4DCT acquisition. Dose was measured at three conditions: static phantom, moving phantom with continuous beam delivery, and moving phantom with gated irradiation. The statically delivered dose distribution was used as a reference. Further, a 4D dose calculation was performed on the 4DCT dataset using a research treatment planning system. Results: The relative rms deviations in the homogenous dose region were {\textasciitilde}18\% without gating, and {\textasciitilde}6\% with gating. The 4D dose calculation showed a decrease in target coverage by {\textasciitilde}20\% and {\textasciitilde}6\%, respectively, for the 95\% isodose line. Conclusions: Gating of a scanned carbon ion beam was applied for treatment of a moving liver tumor and a workflow was developed to verify the dose to be actually delivered. With respect to continuous dose delivery, the target dose improvement achieved due to gating is considered to be significant for this patient.",

PET imaging with FDG allows the assessment of tumor glucose metabolism in vivo; however, a number of other PET tracers are being used in oncologic research to assess changes in other cellular processes associated with malignant transformation of the cell. [11C]-Labeled methionine and choline are being used to assess changes in cell membrane synthesis; however, small studies have not shown the added information from these tracers to be clinically useful. DNA synthesis can be assessed by measuring the uptake of the thymidine analog 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine, which may be more specific for evaluating malignancy without the problem of false-positive results from inflammatory lesions, as seen with FDG. Tumor hypoxia imaging with copper-labeled diacetyl-bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone) or [18F]fluoromisonidazole may provide a better method of predicting which tumors will respond best to conventional therapy. The role of PET will continue to evolve with further clinical studies using these and other new tracers",

In this article, we analyze the distortions introduced in helical scanning of moving objects. Objects of known geometry are placed on a moving sled and scanned in a multirow helical CT scanner. The motion of the sled approximates the magnitude and velocity of organ movement in patients during light respiration (amplitude 1 cm, period 4 seconds). Scans of the phantom are obtained in high speed mode at incremental phases of respiration, and the resulting images are compared with scans obtained when the phantom is static. Computer simulations of the scan process are also performed to interpret the results and extend the analysis to a greater range of parameters in scanning, motion, and object size. Resulting scans show that spherical test objects can be shortened by as much as 2 cm or twice the periodic motion amplitude. Object shape was significantly distorted, and the geometric center of the object was displaced by as much as +/-0.8 cm. Computer simulation results qualitatively agree with the experimentally observed phantom images. These simulations predict that the effect is clearly observable even if the amplitude is decreased to 0.5 cm. Implications of scanning moving objects on treatment planning are discussed",

Segmentation, image registration, visualization are new challenges associated with four-dimensional data sets because of the overwhelming increase in the number of images. Four-dimensional dose calculations, while currently laborious, provide insights into dose perturbations due to organ motion. Imaging before treatment (image guidance) improves accuracy of radiation delivery, and recording transmission images can provide a means of verifying gated delivery",

abstract="We present a method to include robustness in a multi-criteria optimization (MCO) framework for intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT). The approach allows one to simultaneously explore the trade-off between different objectives as well as the trade-off between robustness and nominal plan quality. In MCO, a database of plans each emphasizing different treatment planning objectives, is pre-computed to approximate the Pareto surface. An IMPT treatment plan that strikes the best balance between the different objectives can be selected by navigating on the Pareto surface. In our approach, robustness is integrated into MCO by adding robustified objectives and constraints to the MCO problem. Uncertainties (or errors) of the robust problem are modeled by pre-calculated dose-influence matrices for a nominal scenario and a number of pre-defined error scenarios (shifted patient positions, proton beam undershoot and overshoot). Objectives and constraints can be defined for the nominal scenario, thus characterizing nominal plan quality. A robustified objective represents the worst objective function value that can be realized for any of the error scenarios and thus provides a measure of plan robustness. The optimization method is based on a linear projection solver and is capable of handling large problem sizes resulting from a fine dose grid resolution, many scenarios, and a large number of proton pencil beams. A base-of-skull case is used to demonstrate the robust optimization method. It is demonstrated that the robust optimization method reduces the sensitivity of the treatment plan to setup and range errors to a degree that is not achieved by a safety margin approach. A chordoma case is analyzed in more detail to demonstrate the involved trade-offs between target underdose and brainstem sparing as well as robustness and nominal plan quality. The latter illustrates the advantage of MCO in the context of robust planning. For all cases examined, the robust optimization for each Pareto optimal plan takes less than 5 min on a standard computer, making a computationally friendly interface possible to the planner. In conclusion, the uncertainty pertinent to the IMPT procedure can be reduced during treatment planning by optimizing plans that emphasize different treatment objectives, including robustness, and then interactively seeking for a most-preferred one from the solution Pareto surface",

abstract="We propose a patient-specific planning target volume (PTV) to deal with interfractional variations, and test its feasibility in a retrospective treatment-planning study. Instead of using one planning image only, multiple scans are taken on different days. The target and organs at risk (OARs) are delineated on each images. The proposed PTV is generated from a union of those target contours on the planning images, excluding voxels of the OARs, and is denoted the PTV 'GP-OAR' (global prostate-organs at risk). The study is performed using 'plan of the day' adaptive workflow, which selects a daily plan from a library of plans based on a similarity comparison between the daily scan and planning images. The daily plans optimized for GP-OAR volumes are compared with those optimized for PTVs generated from a single prostate contour (PTV SP). Four CT serials of prostate cancer patient datasets are included in the test, and in total 28 fractions are simulated. The results show that the daily chosen GP-OAR plans provide excellent target coverage, with V95 values of the prostate mostly > 95\%. In addition, dose delivered to the OARs as calculated from applying daily chosen GP-OAR plans is slightly increased but comparable to that calculated from applying daily SP plans. In general, the PTV GP-OARs are able to cover possible target variations while keeping dose delivered to the OARs at a similar level to that of the PTV SPs",

abstract="PURPOSE: A new 4D in vivo dosimetry tool, RADPOS, has been used on lung cancer patients to evaluate the feasibility of using the detectors to characterize variations in patient breathing patterns as well as to monitor daily variations in dose. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The RADPOS system combines a MOSFET dosimeter with an electromagnetic positioning sensor for simultaneous measurement of real-time dose and spatial coordinates. Three RADPOS sensors were placed on patients' chest and abdomen during a 4DCT and daily treatments. A fourth detector was also placed on the couch as reference. Position data were collected in real-time and total dose was read at the end of each fraction. RESULTS: Significant deviations in surface motion have been found between the day of 4DCT and treatment fractions in 9 of 10 patients. Variations in daily dose ranged from 2.5 to 13.7 cGy (2.8-14.0\%) and results agreed with treatment plan values for all but three points. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in breathing motion have been found that emphasize a need for continued position monitoring. RADPOS measurements can be used to monitor such variations as well as to measure surface dose without any disruption to the treatment schedule or discomfort to patients",

abstract="Purpose: The active breathing control (ABC) device allows for temporary immobilization of respiratory motion by implementing a breath hold at a predefined relative lung volume and air flow direction. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the ability of the ABC device to immobilize peripheral lung tumors at a reproducible position, increase total lung volume, and thereby reduce lung mass within the planning target volume (PTV).Methods and materialsTen patients with peripheral non-small-cell lung cancer tumors undergoing radiotherapy had CT scans of their thorax with and without ABC inspiration breath hold during the first 5 days of treatment. Total lung volumes were determined from the CT data sets. Each peripheral lung tumor was contoured by one physician on all CT scans to generate gross tumor volumes (GTVs). The lung density and mass contained within a 1.5-cm PTV margin around each peripheral tumor was calculated using CT numbers. Using the center of the GTV from the Day 1 ABC scan as the reference, the displacement of subsequent GTV centers on Days 2 to 5 for each patient with ABC applied was calculated in three dimensions.ResultsWith the use of ABC inspiration breath hold, total lung volumes increased by an average of 42\%. This resulted in an average decrease in lung mass of 18\% within a standard 1.5-cm PTV margin around the GTV. The average ({\backslash}pm standard deviation) displacement of GTV centers with ABC breath hold applied was 0.3 mm ({\backslash}pm 1.8 mm), 1.2 mm ({\backslash}pm 2.3 mm), and 1.1 mm ({\backslash}pm 3.5 mm) in the lateral direction, anterior-posterior direction, and superior-inferior direction, respectively.ConclusionsResults from this study indicate that there remains some inter-breath hold variability in peripheral lung tumor position with the use of ABC inspiration breath hold, which prevents significant PTV margin reduction. However, lung volumes can significantly increase, thereby decreasing the mass of lung within a standard PTV",

abstract="Radiation dose in the setting of chemo-radiation for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been historically limited by the risk of normal tissue toxicity and this has been hypothesized to correlate with the poor results in regard to local tumor recurrences. Dose escalation, as a means to improve local control, with concurrent chemotherapy has been shown to be feasible with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy in early phase studies with good clinical outcome. However, the potential superiority of moderate dose escalation to 74 Gy has not been shown in phase III randomized studies. In this review, the limitations in target volume definition in previous studies; and the factors that may be critical to safe dose escalation in the treatment of locally advanced NSCLC, such as respiratory motion management, image guidance, intensity modulation, FDG-positron emission tomography incorporation in the treatment planning process, and adaptive radiotherapy, are discussed. These factors, along with novel treatment approaches that have emerged in recent years, are proposed to warrant further investigation in future trials in a more comprehensive and integrated fashion",

abstract="The accuracy of delivering gated-radiation therapy to lung tumors using an external respiratory surrogate relies on not only interfractional and intrafractional reproducibility, but also a strong correlation between external motion and internal tumor motion. The purpose of this work was to use the cine images acquired by four-dimensional computed tomography acquisition protocol to study the relation between external surface motion and internal tumor motion. The respiratory phase information of tumor motion and chest wall motion was measured on the cine images using a proposed region-of-interest (ROI) method and compared to measurement of an external respiratory monitoring device. On eight lung patient data sets, the phase shifts were measured between (1) the signal of a real-time positioning-management (RPM) respiratory monitoring device placed in the abdominal region and four surface locations on the chest wall, (2) the RPM signal in the abdominal region and tumor motions, and (3) chest wall surface motions and tumor motions. Respiratory waveforms measured at different surface locations during the same respiratory cycle often varied and had significant phase shifts. Seven of the 8 patients showed the abdominal motion leading chest wall motion. The best correlation (smallest phase shift) was found between the abdominal motion and the superior-inferior (S-I) tumor motion. A wide range of phase shifts was observed between external surface motion and tumor anterior-posterior (A-P)/lateral motion. The result supported the placement of the RPM block in the abdominal region and suggested that during a gated therapy utilizing the RPM system, it is necessary to place the RPM block at the same location as it is during treatment simulation in order to reduce potential errors introduced by the position of the RPM block. Correlations between external motions and lateral/A-P tumor motions were inconclusive due to a combination of patient selection and the limitation of the ROI method",

abstract="PURPOSE: Phase-based and amplitude-based sorting techniques are commonly used in four-dimensional CT (4DCT) reconstruction. However, effect of these sorting techniques on 4D dose calculation has not been explored. In this study, the authors investigated a candidate 4DCT sorting technique by comparing its 4D dose calculation accuracy with that for phase-based and amplitude-based sorting techniques. METHOD: An optimization model was formed using organ motion probability density function (PDF) in the 4D dose convolution. The objective function for optimization was defined as the maximum difference between the expected 4D dose in organ of interest and the 4D dose calculated using a 4DCT sorted by a candidate sampling method. Sorting samples, as optimization variables, were selected on the respiratory motion PDF assessed during the CT scanning. Breathing curves obtained from patients' 4DCT scanning, as well as 3D dose distribution from treatment planning, were used in the study. Given the objective function, a residual error analysis was performed, and k-means clustering was found to be an effective sampling scheme to improve the 4D dose calculation accuracy and independent with the patient-specific dose distribution. RESULTS: Patient data analysis demonstrated that the k-means sampling was superior to the conventional phase-based and amplitude-based sorting and comparable to the optimal sampling results. For phase-based sorting, the residual error in 4D dose calculations may not be further reduced to an acceptable accuracy after a certain number of phases, while for amplitude-based sorting, k-means sampling, and the optimal sampling, the residual error in 4D dose calculations decreased rapidly as the number of 4DCT phases increased to 6. CONCLUSION: An innovative phase sorting method (k-means method) is presented in this study. The method is dependent only on tumor motion PDF. It could provide a way to refine the phase sorting in 4DCT reconstruction and is effective for 4D dose accumulation. Optimized sorting techniques could achieve acceptable residuals (less than 0.5\% of the prescription dose) using 6 sorting samples, which is much better than amplitude-based or phase-based sorting. Further increase in sorting phase number exceeding 6 or more may not be necessary when using the k-means sampling or optimal sampling points",

abstract="PURPOSE: We present results of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with proton beam therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We reviewed 162 patients having 192 HCCs treated from November 1985 to July 1998 by proton beam therapy with or without transarterial embolization and percutaneous ethanol injection. The patients in the present series were considered unsuitable for surgery for various reasons, including hepatic dysfunction, multiple tumors, recurrence after surgical resection, and concomitant illnesses. The median total dose of proton irradiation was 72 Gy in 16 fractions over 29 days. RESULTS: The overall survival rate for all of the 162 patients was 23.5\% at 5 years. The local control rate at 5 years was 86.9\% for all 192 tumors among the 162 patients. The degree of impairment of hepatic functions attributable to coexisting liver cirrhosis and the number of tumors in the liver significantly affected patient survival. For 50 patients having least impaired hepatic functions and a solitary tumor, the survival rate at 5 years was 53.5\%. The patients had very few acute reactions to treatments and a few late sequelae during and after the treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy for patients with HCC is effective, safe, well tolerable, and repeatable. It is the useful treatment mode for either cure or palliation for patients with HCC irrespective of tumor size, tumor location in the liver, insufficient feeding of the tumor with arteries, presence of vascular invasion, impaired hepatic functions, and coexisting intercurrent diseases",

abstract="Four-dimensional volumetric modulated arc therapy (4D VMAT) is a treatment strategy for lung cancers that aims to exploit relative target and tissue motion to improve organ at risk (OAR) sparing. The algorithm incorporates the entire patient respiratory cycle using 4D CT data into the optimization process. Resulting treatment plans synchronize the delivery of each beam aperture to a specific phase of target motion. Stereotactic body radiation therapy treatment plans for 4D VMAT, gated VMAT, and 3D VMAT were generated on three patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Tumour motion ranged from 1.4-3.4 cm. The dose and fractionation scheme was 48 Gy in four fractions. A B-spline transformation model registered the 4D CT images. 4D dose volume histograms (4D DVH) were calculated from total dose accumulated at the maximum exhalation. For the majority of OARs, gated VMAT achieved the most radiation sparing but treatment times were 77-148\% longer than 3D VMAT. 4D VMAT plan qualities were comparable to gated VMAT, but treatment times were only 11-25\% longer than 3D VMAT. 4D VMAT's improvement of healthy tissue sparing can allow for further dose escalation. Future study could potentially adapt 4D VMAT to irregular patient breathing patterns",

abstract="PURPOSE: Evaluation of the effect of co-registered 4D-(18)FDG-PET/CT for SBRT target delineation in patients with central versus peripheral lung tumors. METHODS: Analysis of internal target volume (ITV) delineation of central and peripheral lung lesions in 21 SBRT-patients. Manual delineation was performed by 4 observers in 2 contouring phases: on respiratory gated 4DCT with diagnostic 3DPET available aside (CT-ITV) and on co-registered 4DPET/CT (PET/CT-ITV). Comparative analysis of volumes and inter-reader agreement. RESULTS: 11 cases of peripheral and 10 central lesions were evaluated. In peripheral lesions, average CT-ITV was 6.2 cm(3) and PET/CT-ITV 8.6 cm(3), resembling a mean change in hypothetical radius of 2 mm. For both CT-ITVs and PET/CT-ITVs inter reader agreement was good and unchanged (0.733 and 0.716; p=0.58). All PET/CT-ITVs stayed within the PTVs derived from CT-ITVs. In central lesions, average CT-ITVs were 42.1 cm(3), PET/CT-ITVs 44.2 cm(3), without significant overall volume changes. Inter-reader agreement improved significantly (0.665 and 0.750; p<0.05). 2/10 PET/CT-ITVs exceeded the PTVs derived from CT-ITVs by >1 ml in average for all observers. CONCLUSION: The addition of co-registered 4DPET data to 4DCT based target volume delineation for SBRT of centrally located lung tumors increases the inter-observer agreement and may help to avoid geographic misses",

Image guidance can reduce uncertainty by increasing precision and accuracy through improved patient selection, target delineation, and improved knowledge of nodal involvement. Conformal imaging-based radiotherapy (RT) can allow dose escalation. In the future, imaging may allow adaptive RT to be exploited in selected patients, especially those with large geometric changes occurring during RT. Furthermore, functional imaging, although in its infancy, has the potential to significantly improve RT, from RT planning and delivery to outcome assessment",

abstract="INTRODUCTION: Rectal volume and movement are major factors that influence prostate location. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a rectal enema on intrafraction prostate motion. METHODS: The data from 12 patients with localised prostate cancer were analysed. Each patient underwent image-guided radiotherapy (RT), receiving a total dose of 70 Gy in 28 fractions. Rectal enemas were administered to all of the patients before each RT fraction. The location of the prostate was determined by implanting three fiducial markers under the guidance of transrectal ultrasound. Each patient underwent preparation for IGRT twice before an RT fraction and in the middle of the fraction. The intrafraction displacement of the prostate was calculated by comparing fiducial marker locations before and in the middle of an RT fraction. RESULTS: The rectal enemas were well tolerated by patients. The mean intrafraction prostate movement in 336 RT fractions was 1.11 +/- 0.77 mm (range 0.08-7.20 mm). Intrafraction motions of 1, 2 and 3 mm were observed in 56.0\%, 89.0\% and 97.6\% of all RT fractions, respectively. The intrafraction movements on supero-inferior and anteroposterior axes were larger than on the right-to-left axes (P < 0.05). The CTV-to-PTV margin necessary to allow for movement, calculated using the van Herk formula (2.5Sigma + 0.7sigma), was 1.50 mm. CONCLUSIONS: A daily rectal enema before each RT fraction was tolerable and yielded little intrafraction prostate displacement. We think the use of rectal enemas is a feasible method to reduce prostate movement during RT",

abstract="PURPOSE: An on-line system to ensure accuracy of daily setup and therapy of the prostate has been implemented with no equipment modification required. We report results and accuracy of patient setup using this system. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Radiopaque fiducial markers were implanted into the prostate before radiation therapy. Lateral digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) were obtained from planning CT data. Before each treatment fraction, a lateral amorphous silicon (aSi) portal image was acquired and the position of the fiducial markers was compared to the DRRs using chamfer matching. Couch translation only was used to account for marker position displacements, followed by a second lateral portal image to verify isocenter position. Residual displacement data for the aSi and previous portal film systems were compared. RESULTS: This analysis includes a total of 239 portal images during treatment in 17 patients. Initial prostate center of mass (COM) displacements in the superior, inferior, anterior, and posterior directions were a maximum of 7 mm, 9 mm, 10 mm and 11 mm respectively. After identification and correction, prostate COM displacements were <3 mm in all directions. The therapists found it simple to match markers 88\% of the time using this system. Treatment delivery times were in the order of 9 min for patients requiring isocenter adjustment and 6 min for those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: This system is technically possible to implement and use as part of an on-line correction protocol and does not require a longer than standard daily appointment time at our center with the current action limit of 3 mm. The system is commercially available and is more efficient and user-friendly than portal film analysis. It provides the opportunity to identify and accommodate interfraction organ motion and may also permit the use of smaller margins during conformal prostate radiotherapy. Further integration of the system such as remote table control would improve efficiency",

abstract="New generation of radiation therapy accelerators requires highly accurate dose measurements with high spatial resolution patterns. IMRT is especially demanding since the positioning accuracy of all the multi-leafs should be verified for each applied field and at any incidence. A new 2-D tissue equivalent dosemeter is presented with high spatial resolution that can fulfil these tasks. A plastic scintillator sheet is sandwiched between two polystyrene cubes, and the emitted light is observed by a high-resolution camera. A patented procedure allows efficient discrimination of the scintillation proportional to the dose from the parasitic Cerenkov radiation. This extraction made on the cumulated images taken during an irradiation field at a rate of 10 images s(-1) provides high-resolution mapping of the dose rate and cumulated dose in quasi real time. The dosemeter is tissue equivalent (ICRU-44) and works both for electrons and photons without complex parameter adjustment, since phantom and detector materials are identical. The calibration is simple and independent of the irradiation conditions (energy, fluence, quality and so on). The principle of the dosemeter and its calibration procedure are discussed in this paper. The results and, in particular, the dose depth profiles are compared with standard ionisation chamber measurements in polystyrene for both photons and electrons. Finally, the detector specifications are summarised and one example of complex IMRT field is discussed",

abstract="PURPOSE: To assess and compare the dosimetric impact of dynamic multileaf collimator (DMLC) tracking and gating as motion correction strategies to account for intrafraction motion during conventionally fractionated prostate radiotherapy. METHODS: A dose reconstruction method was used to retrospectively assess the dose distributions delivered without motion correction during volumetric modulated arc therapy fractions for 20 fractions of five prostate cancer patients who received conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. These delivered dose distributions were compared with the dose distributions which would have been delivered had DMLC tracking or gating motion correction strategies been implemented. The delivered dose distributions were constructed by incorporating the observed prostate motion with the patient's original treatment plan to simulate the treatment delivery. The DMLC tracking dose distributions were constructed using the same dose reconstruction method with the addition of MLC positions from Linac log files obtained during DMLC tracking simulations with the observed prostate motions input to the DMLC tracking software. The gating dose distributions were constructed by altering the prostate motion to simulate the application of a gating threshold of 3 mm for 5 s. RESULTS: The delivered dose distributions showed that dosimetric effects of intrafraction prostate motion could be substantial for some fractions, with an estimated dose decrease of more than 19\% and 34\% from the planned CTVD99\% and PTV D95\% values, respectively, for one fraction. Evaluation of dose distributions for DMLC tracking and gating deliveries showed that both interventions were effective in improving the CTV D99\% for all of the selected fractions to within 4\% of planned value for all fractions. For the delivered dose distributions the difference in rectum V65\% for the individual fractions from planned ranged from -44\% to 101\% and for the bladder V65\% the range was -61\% to 26\% from planned. The application of tracking decreased the maximum rectum and bladder V65\% difference to 6\% and 4\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, the dosimetric impact of DMLC tracking and gating to account for intrafraction motion during prostate radiotherapy has been assessed and compared with no motion correction. Without motion correction intrafraction prostate motion can result in a significant decrease in target dose coverage for a small number of individual fractions. This is unlikely to effect the overall treatment for most patients undergoing conventionally fractionated treatments. Both DMLC tracking and gating demonstrate dose distributions for all assessed fractions that are robust to intrafraction motion",

abstract="CONTEXT: The risks associated with new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) among middle-aged women and populations with a low comorbidity burden are poorly defined. OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between incident AF and mortality in initially healthy women and to evaluate the influence of associated cardiovascular comorbidities on risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between 1993 and March 16, 2010, 34,722 women participating in the Women's Health Study underwent prospective follow-up. Participants were 95\% white, older than 45 years (median, 53 [interquartile range \{IQR\}, 49-59] years), and free of AF and cardiovascular disease at baseline. Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying covariates were used to determine the risk of events among women with incident AF. Secondary analyses were performed among women with paroxysmal AF. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes included all-cause, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes included stroke, congestive heart failure, and myocardial infarction. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 15.4 (IQR, 14.7-15.8) years, 1011 women developed AF. Incidence rates per 1000 person-years among women with and without AF were 10.8 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 8.1-13.5) and 3.1 (95\% CI, 2.9-3.2) for all-cause mortality, 4.3 (95\% CI, 2.6-6.0) and 0.57 (95\% CI, 0.5-0.6) for cardiovascular mortality, and 6.5 (95\% CI, 4.4-8.6) and 2.5 (95\% CI, 2.4-2.6) for noncardiovascular mortality, respectively. In multivariable models, hazard ratios (HRs) of new-onset AF for all-cause, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular mortality were 2.14 (95\% CI, 1.64-2.77), 4.18 (95\% CI, 2.69-6.51), and 1.66 (95\% CI, 1.19-2.30), respectively. Adjustment for nonfatal cardiovascular events potentially on the causal pathway to death attenuated these risks, but incident AF remained associated with all mortality components (all-cause: HR, 1.70 [95\% CI, 1.30-2.22]; cardiovascular: HR, 2.57 [95\% CI, 1.63-4.07]; and noncardiovascular: HR, 1.42 [95\% CI, 1.02-1.98]). Among women with paroxysmal AF (n = 656), the increase in mortality risk was limited to cardiovascular causes (HR, 2.94; 95\% CI, 1.55-5.59). CONCLUSION: Among a group of healthy women, new-onset AF was independently associated with all-cause, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular mortality, with some of the risk potentially explained by nonfatal cardiovascular events",

abstract="PURPOSE: To propose and evaluate online adaptive radiation therapy (ART) using in-room computed tomography (CT) imaging that detects changes in the target position and shape of the prostate and seminal vesicles (SVs) and then automatically modifies the multileaf collimator (MLC) leaf pairs in a slice-by-slice fashion. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) using a coplanar beam arrangement, each MLC leaf pair projects onto a specific anatomic slice. The proposed strategy assumes that shape deformation is a function of only the superior-inferior (SI) position. That is, there is no shape change within a CT slice, but each slice can be displaced in the anteroposterior (AP) or right-left (RL) direction relative to adjacent slices. First, global shifts (in SI, AP, and RL directions) were calculated by three-dimensional (3D) registration of the bulk of the prostate in the treatment planning CT images with the daily CT images taken immediately before treatment. Local shifts in the AP direction were then found using slice-by-slice registration, in which the CT slices were individually registered. The translational shift within a slice could then be projected to a translational shift in the position of the corresponding MLC leaf pair for each treatment segment for each gantry angle. Global shifts in the SI direction were accounted for by moving the open portal superiorly or inferiorly by an integral number of leaf pairs. The proposed slice-by-slice registration technique was tested by using daily CT images from 46 CT image sets (23 each from 2 patients) taken before the standard delivery of IMRT for prostate cancer. A dosimetric evaluation was carried out by using an 8-field IMRT plan. RESULTS: The shifts and shape change of the prostate and SVs could be separated into 3D global shifts in the RL, AP, and SI directions, plus local shifts in the AP direction, which were different for each CT slice. The MLC leaf positions were successfully modified to compensate for these global shifts and local shape variations. The ART method improved geometric coverage of the prostate and SVs compared with the couch-shift method, particularly for the superior part of the prostate and all the SVs, for which the interfraction shape change was the largest. The dosimetric comparison showed that the ART method covered the target better and reduced the rectal dose more than a simple couch-translation method. CONCLUSIONS: ART corrected for interfraction changes in the position and shape of the prostate and SVs and gave dose distributions that were considerably closer to the planned dose distributions than could be achieved with simple alignment strategies that neglect shape change. The ART proposed in this investigation requires neither contouring of the daily CT images nor extensive calculations; therefore, it may prove to be an effective and clinically practical solution to the problem of interfraction shape changes",

abstract="All particle beam scanning systems are subject to dose delivery errors due to errors in position, energy and intensity of the delivered beam. In addition, finite scan speeds, beam spill non-uniformities, and delays in detector, detector electronics and magnet responses will all contribute errors in delivery. In this paper, we present dose errors for an 8 x 10 x 8 cm(3) target of uniform water equivalent density with 8 cm spread out Bragg peak and a prescribed dose of 2 Gy. Lower doses are also analyzed and presented later in the paper. Beam energy errors and errors due to limitations of scanning system hardware have been included in the analysis. By using Gaussian shaped pencil beams derived from measurements in the research room of the James M Slater Proton Treatment and Research Center at Loma Linda, CA and executing treatment simulations multiple times, statistical dose errors have been calculated in each 2.5 mm cubic voxel in the target. These errors were calculated by delivering multiple treatments to the same volume and calculating the rms variation in delivered dose at each voxel in the target. The variations in dose were the result of random beam delivery errors such as proton energy, spot position and intensity fluctuations. The results show that with reasonable assumptions of random beam delivery errors, the spot scanning technique yielded an rms dose error in each voxel less than 2\% or 3\% of the 2 Gy prescribed dose. These calculated errors are within acceptable clinical limits for radiation therapy",

abstract="A phase Ilate/II trial of hyperfractionated (HFX) radiation therapy for non-small-cell carcinoma of the lung (NSCCL) was conducted by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) between 1983 and 1987. Fractions of 1.2 Gy were administered twice daily with greater than or equal to 4 hours between fractions. Patients were randomized to receive minimum total doses of 60.0, 64.8, and 69.6 Gy. After acceptable risks of acute and late effects were found, 74.4 Gy and 79.2 Gy arms were added, and the lowest total dose arms were closed. No significant differences in the risks of acute or late effects in normal tissues were found among the 848 patients analyzed in the five arms; risks of severe or life-threatening pneumonitis were 2.6\% for 60.0 to 64.8 Gy, 5.7\% for 69.6 to 74.4 Gy, and 8.1\% for 79.2 Gy. Among 350 patients who had the same criteria as Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) protocol 84-33 (American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging [AJCCS], 1984, stage III; Karnofsky performance status [KPS] 70 to 100; less than 6\% weight loss), there was a dose response for survival: survival with 69.6 Gy (median, 13.0 months; 2 years, 29\%) was significantly (P = .02) better than the lower total doses. There were no differences in survival among the three highest total-dose arms. Comparisons with results in similar patients treated with 60 Gy in 30 fractions of 2.0 Gy 5 days per week for 6 weeks suggest benefit from HFX radiation therapy with 69.6 Gy. Improvement in survival with HFX radiation therapy at 69.6 Gy total dose without increase in normal tissue effects, justifies phase III comparison with standard fractionation alone and combined with systemic chemotherapy in this common presentation of NSCCL",

Six patients had undergone a previous cardiac operation and 28\% underwent concomitant cardiac procedures in addition to the maze procedure. One patient (1.3\%) died 10 days after undergoing a combined maze procedure and Morrow procedure for the management of chronic atrial fibrillation and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Postoperative atrial pacemakers were required in 40\%: 26\% for preoperative sick sinus syndrome and 6\% for iatrogenic injury of the sinus node, and 8\% had pacemakers in place preoperatively. As of December 31, 1992, 65 patients had been followed up for at least 3 months after operation (range, 3 to 63 months). The maze procedure cured atrial fibrillation, restored atrioventricular synchrony, and preserved atrial transport function in 64 of 65 patients (98\%). The procedure has been curative without the need for medications in 58 of 65 patients (89\%) and with the need for medications in 6 of 65 (9\%), with medications failing in only 1 of the 65 patients (2\%). The results support the maze procedure as the treatment of choice in patients with medically refractory symptomatic atrial fibrillation",

abstract="PURPOSE: Three-dimensional (3D) radiation treatment planning is facilitated through the use of computerized radiation treatment planning systems (RTPSs) and CT simulators (CT-sims). Quality assurance (QA) of these systems is necessary for ensuring that they fulfill their potential. However, comprehensive tools for the systematic QA of these systems have not been developed. We present a phantom that facilitates the evaluation of a large number of nondosimetric functions. These include CT image acquisition and transfer, graphical displays of 3D radiation beams, multiplanar CT image reconstructions, digitally reconstructed radiographs, the representation and manipulation of contoured patient anatomy, dose volume histograms, and the conversion of CT numbers to relative electron densities. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A phantom was constructed which contains materials and geometries that are appropriate for the routine QA of the features described above. The anatomy of the phantom is used as a standard against which the performance of the 3D-RTPS or CT-sim is evaluated. The phantom was used to evaluate three different 3D-RTPSs and a CT-sim at four institutions. RESULTS: Using this phantom, clinically significant errors and limitations in commercially available 3D treatment planning software were discovered. No errors were discovered in the beam display or image reconstructions in the systems examined. Problems were found in the anatomy display, automatic tools, and the CT number to relative electron density conversion data used in some of the systems. CONCLUSION: This phantom is a unique tool designed explicitly for the QA of 3D treatment planning software. Errors and limitations discovered through its use indicate that the QA of commercial treatment planning software is necessary, and that this phantom is an effective device for this task",

abstract="In-beam positron emission tomography (in-beam PET) is currently the only method for an in situ monitoring of highly tumour-conformed charged hadron therapy. At the experimental carbon ion tumour therapy facility, running at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung, Darmstadt, Germany, all treatments have been monitored by means of a specially adapted dual-head PET scanner. The positive clinical impact of this project triggered the construction of a hospital-based hadron therapy facility, with in-beam PET expected to monitor more delicate radiotherapeutic situations. Therefore, we have studied possible in-beam PET improvements by optimizing the arrangement of the gamma-ray detectors. For this, a fully 3D, rebinning-free, maximum likelihood expectation maximization algorithm applicable to several closed-ring or dual-head tomographs has been developed. The analysis of beta(+)-activity distributions simulated from real-treatment situations and detected with several detector arrangements allows us to conclude that a dual-head tomograph with narrow gaps yields in-beam PET images with sufficient quality for monitoring head and neck treatments. For monitoring larger irradiation fields, e.g. treatments in the pelvis region, a closed-ring tomograph was seen to be highly desirable. Finally, a study of the space availability for patient and bed, tomograph and beam portal proves the implementation of a closed-ring detector arrangement for in-beam PET to be feasible",

For tau < or = 200 ps full width at half maximum, the information given by the time-of-flight (TOF) difference between the two opposing gamma-rays enables shift-variant, artefact-free in-beam tomographic imaging by means of limited-angle, dual-head detectors. We present the corresponding fast, TOF-based and backprojection-free, 3D reconstruction algorithm that, coupled with a real-time data acquisition and a fast detector encoding scheme, allows the sampled beta+-activity to be visualized in the object during the course of the irradiation. Despite the very low statistics scenario typical of in-beam PET, real-treatment simulations show that in-beam TOF-PET enables high-precision images to be obtained in real-time, either with closed-ring or with fixed, dual-head in-beam TOF-PET systems. The latter greatly alleviates the installation of in-beam PET at radiotherapeutic sites",

abstract="The integration of electroanatomic maps with highly resolved computed tomography cardiac images plays an important role in the successful planning of the ablation procedure of arrhythmias. In this paper, we present and validate a fully-automated strategy for the registration and fusion of sparse, atrial endocardial electroanatomic maps (CARTO maps) with detailed left atrial (LA) anatomical reconstructions segmented from a pre-procedural MDCT scan. Registration is accomplished by a parameterized geometric transformation of the CARTO points and by a stochastic search of the best parameter set which minimizes the misalignment between transformed CARTO points and the LA surface. The subsequent fusion of electrophysiological information on the registered CT atrium is obtained through radial basis function interpolation. The algorithm is validated by simulation and by real data from 14 patients referred to CT imaging prior to the ablation procedure. Results are presented, which show the validity of the algorithmic scheme as well as the accuracy and reproducibility of the integration process. The obtained results encourage the application of the integration method in post-intervention ablation assessment and basic AF research and suggest the development for real-time applications in catheter guiding during ablation intervention",

abstract="Precise lung tumor localization in real time is particularly important for some motion management techniques, such as respiratory gating or beam tracking with a dynamic multi-leaf collimator, due to the reduced clinical tumor volume (CTV) to planning target volume (PTV) margin and/or the escalated dose. There might be large uncertainties in deriving tumor position from external respiratory surrogates. While tracking implanted fiducial markers has sufficient accuracy, this procedure may not be widely accepted due to the risk of pneumothorax. Previously, we have developed a technique to generate gating signals from fluoroscopic images without implanted fiducial markers using a template matching method (Berbeco et al 2005 Phys. Med. Biol. 50 4481-90, Cui et al 2007 Phys. Med. Biol. 52 741-55). In this paper, we present an extension of this method to multiple-template matching for directly tracking the lung tumor mass in fluoroscopy video. The basic idea is as follows: (i) during the patient setup session, a pair of orthogonal fluoroscopic image sequences are taken and processed off-line to generate a set of reference templates that correspond to different breathing phases and tumor positions; (ii) during treatment delivery, fluoroscopic images are continuously acquired and processed; (iii) the similarity between each reference template and the processed incoming image is calculated; (iv) the tumor position in the incoming image is then estimated by combining the tumor centroid coordinates in reference templates with proper weights based on the measured similarities. With different handling of image processing and similarity calculation, two such multiple-template tracking techniques have been developed: one based on motion-enhanced templates and Pearson's correlation score while the other based on eigen templates and mean-squared error. The developed techniques have been tested on six sequences of fluoroscopic images from six lung cancer patients against the reference tumor positions manually determined by a radiation oncologist. The tumor centroid coordinates automatically detected using both methods agree well with the manually marked reference locations. The eigenspace tracking method performs slightly better than the motion-enhanced method, with average localization errors less than 2 pixels (1 mm) and the error at a 95\% confidence level of about 2-4 pixels (1-2 mm). This work demonstrates the feasibility of direct tracking of a lung tumor mass in fluoroscopic images without implanted fiducial markers using multiple reference templates",

abstract="For gated lung cancer radiotherapy, it is difficult to generate accurate gating signals due to the large uncertainties when using external surrogates and the risk of pneumothorax when using implanted fiducial markers. We have previously investigated and demonstrated the feasibility of generating gating signals using the correlation scores between the reference template image and the fluoroscopic images acquired during the treatment. In this paper, we present an in-depth study, aiming at the improvement of robustness of the algorithm and its validation using multiple sets of patient data. Three different template generating and matching methods have been developed and evaluated: (1) single template method, (2) multiple template method, and (3) template clustering method. Using the fluoroscopic data acquired during patient setup before each fraction of treatment, reference templates are built that represent the tumour position and shape in the gating window, which is assumed to be at the end-of-exhale phase. For the single template method, all the setup images within the gating window are averaged to generate a composite template. For the multiple template method, each setup image in the gating window is considered as a reference template and used to generate an ensemble of correlation scores. All the scores are then combined to generate the gating signal. For the template clustering method, clustering (grouping of similar objects together) is performed to reduce the large number of reference templates into a few representative ones. Each of these methods has been evaluated against the reference gating signal as manually determined by a radiation oncologist. Five patient datasets were used for evaluation. In each case, gated treatments were simulated at both 35\% and 50\% duty cycles. False positive, negative and total error rates were computed. Experiments show that the single template method is sensitive to noise; the multiple template and clustering methods are more robust to noise due to the smoothing effect of aggregation of correlation scores; and the clustering method results in the best performance in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy",

abstract="Significant differences between planned and delivered treatments may occur due to respiration-induced tumour motion, leading to underdosing of parts of the tumour and overdosing of parts of the surrounding critical structures. Existing methods proposed to counter tumour motion include breath-holds, gating and MLC-based tracking. Breath-holds and gating techniques increase treatment time considerably, whereas MLC-based tracking is limited to two dimensions. We present an alternative solution in which a robotic couch moves in real time in response to organ motion. To demonstrate proof-of-principle, we constructed a miniature adaptive couch model consisting of two movable platforms that simulate tumour motion and couch motion, respectively. These platforms were connected via an electronic feedback loop so that the bottom platform responded to the motion of the top platform. We tested our model with a seven-field step-and-shoot delivery case in which we performed three film-based experiments: (1) static geometry, (2) phantom-only motion and (3) phantom motion with simulated couch motion. Our measurements demonstrate that the miniature couch was able to compensate for phantom motion to the extent that the dose distributions were practically indistinguishable from those in static geometry. Motivated by this initial success, we investigated a real-time couch compensation system consisting of a stereoscopic infra-red camera system interfaced to a robotic couch known as the Hexapod\&trade;, which responds in real time to any change in position detected by the cameras. Optical reflectors placed on a solid water phantom were used as surrogates for motion. We tested the effectiveness of couch-based motion compensation for fixed fields and a dynamic arc delivery cases. Due to hardware limitations, we performed film-based experiments (1), (2) and (3), with the robotic couch at a phantom motion period and dose rate of 16 s and 100 MU min\$^\&minus;1\$, respectively. Analysis of film measurements showed near-equivalent dose distributions (\&les;2 mm agreement of corresponding isodose lines) for static geometry and motion-synchronized real-time robotic couch tracking-based radiation delivery",

To design such a couch, the required couch and control system dynamics need to be investigated. We used an existing treatment couch known as the Hexapod to gain insight into couch dynamics and an internal model controller to simulate feedback control of respiration-induced motion. The couch dynamics, described using time constants and dead times, were investigated using step inputs. The resulting data were modeled as first and second order systems with dead time. The couch was determined to have a linear response for step inputs < or = 1 cm. Motion data from 12 patients were obtained using a skin marker placed on the abdomen of the patient and the marker data were assumed to be an exact surrogate of tumor motion. The feedback system was modeled with the couch as a second-ordersystem and the controller as a first order system. The time constants of the couch and controller and the dead times were varied starting with parameters obtained from the Hexapod couch and the performance of the feedback system was evaluated. The resulting residual motion under feedback control was generally <0.3 cm when a fast enough couch was simulated",

We present an approach avoiding these difficulties by respiratory-gating the PET data and correcting it for motion with optical flow algorithms. The resulting dataset contains all the PET information and minimal motion and, thus, allows more accurate attenuation correction and quantification",

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of the No Action Level (NAL) off-line correction protocol in the reduction of systematic prostate displacements as determined from electronic portal images (EPI) using implanted markers. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four platinum markers, two near the apex and two near the base of the prostate, were implanted for localization purposes in patients who received fractionated high dose rate brachytherapy. During the following course of 25 fractions of external beam radiotherapy, the position of each marker relative to the corresponding position in digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) was measured in EPI in 15 patients for on average 17 fractions per patient. These marker positions yield the composite displacements due to both setup error and internal prostate motion, relative to the planning computed tomography scan. As the NAL protocol is highly effective in reducing systematic errors (recurring each fraction) due to setup inaccuracy alone, we investigated its efficacy in reducing systematic composite displacements. The analysis was performed for the center of mass (COM) of the four markers, as well as for the cranial and caudal markers separately. Furthermore, the impact of prostate rotation on the achieved positioning accuracy was determined. RESULTS: In case of no setup corrections, the standard deviations of the systematic composite displacements of the COM were 3-4 mm in the craniocaudal and anterior-posterior directions, and 2 mm in the left-right direction. The corresponding SDs of the random displacements (interfraction fluctuations) were 2-3 mm in each direction. When applying a NAL protocol based on three initial treatment fractions, the SDs of the systematic COM displacements were reduced to 1-2 mm. Displacements at the cranial end of the prostate were slightly larger than at the caudal end, and quantitative analysis showed this originates from left-right axis rotations about the prostate apex. Further analysis revealed that significant time trends are present in these prostate rotations. No significant trends were observed for the prostate translations. CONCLUSIONS: The NAL protocol based on marker positions in EPI halved the composite systematic displacements using only three imaged fractions per patient, and thus allowed for a significant reduction of planning margins. Although large rotations of the prostate, and time trends therein, were observed, the net impact on the measured displacements and on the accuracy obtained with NAL was small",

abstract="PURPOSE: To retrospectively test the hypothesis that rectal distension on the planning computed tomography (CT) scan is associated with an increased risk of biochemical and local failure among patients irradiated for prostate carcinoma when a daily repositioning technique based on direct prostate-organ localization is not used. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study included 127 patients who received definitive three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer to a total dose of 78 Gy at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Rectal distension was assessed by calculation of the average cross-sectional rectal area (CSA; defined as the rectal volume divided by length) and measuring three rectal diameters on the planning CT. The impact of rectal distension on biochemical control, 2-year prostate biopsy results, and incidence of Grade 2 or greater late rectal bleeding was assessed. RESULTS: The incidence of biochemical failure was significantly higher among patients with distended rectums (CSA >11.2 cm(2)) on the planning CT scan (p = 0.0009, log-rank test). Multivariate analysis indicates that rectal distension and high-risk disease are independent risk factors for biochemical failure, with hazard ratios of 3.89 (95\% C.I. 1.58 to 9.56, p = 0.003) and 2.45 (95\% C.I. 1.18 to 5.08, p = 0.016), respectively. The probability of residual tumor without evidence of radiation treatment (as scored by the pathologist) increased significantly with rectal distension (p = 0.010, logistic analysis), and a lower incidence of Grade 2 or greater late rectal bleeding within 2 years was simultaneously observed with higher CSA values (p = 0.031, logistic analysis). CONCLUSIONS: We found strong evidence that rectal distension on the treatment-planning CT scan decreased the probability of biochemical control, local control, and rectal toxicity in patients who were treated without daily image-guided prostate localization, presumably because of geographic misses. Therefore, an empty rectum is warranted at the time of simulation. These results also emphasize the need for image-guided radiotherapy to improve local control in irradiating prostate cancer",

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate whether computer-optimized fully noncoplanar beam setups may improve treatment plans for the stereotactic treatment of liver tumors. METHODS: An algorithm for automated beam orientation and weight selection (Cycle) was extended for noncoplanar stereotactic treatments. For 8 liver patients previously treated in our clinic using a prescription isodose of 65\%, Cycle was used to generate noncoplanar and coplanar plans with the highest achievable minimum planning target volume (PTV) dose for the clinically delivered isocenter and mean liver doses, while not violating the clinically applied hard planning constraints. The clinical and the optimized coplanar and noncoplanar plans were compared, with respect to D(PTV,99\%), the dose received by 99\% of the PTV, the PTV generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD), and the compliance with the clinical constraints. RESULTS: For each patient, the ratio between D(PTV,99\%) and D(isoc), and the gEUD(-5) and gEUD(-20) values of the optimized noncoplanar plan were higher than for the clinical plan with an average increase of respectively 18.8\% (range, 7.8-24.0\%), 6.4 Gy (range, 3.4-11.8 Gy), and 10.3 Gy (range, 6.7-12.5). D(PTV,99\%)/D(isoc), gEUD(-5), and gEUD(-20) of the optimized noncoplanar plan was always higher than for the optimized coplanar plan with an average increase of, respectively, 4.5\% (range, 0.2-9.7\%), 2.7 Gy (range, 0.6-9.7 Gy), and 3.4 Gy (range, 0.6-9.9 Gy). All plans were within the imposed hard constraints. On average, the organs at risk were better spared with the optimized noncoplanar plan than with the optimized coplanar plan and the clinical plan. CONCLUSIONS: The use of automatically generated, fully noncoplanar beam setups results in plans that are favorable compared with coplanar techniques. Because of the automation, we found that the planning workload can be decreased from 1 to 2 days to 1 to 2 h",

abstract="Limited disease small cell lung cancer (LD-SCLC) is a heterogeneous disease, not only for its clinical behavior, but also for is anatomical extension. In very rare, early cases, LD-SCLC might be treated with surgery and chemotherapy, but as the overwhelming majority of patients present with locally advanced disease, the standard of care is concurrent chest radiotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy followed by prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Newer chemotherapeutic drugs as well as targeted agents have not improved the outcome thus far. Given concurrently with chest irradiation, cisplatin combined with etoposide, administered every 21 days for 4-5 cycles have frequently been used. Thoracic radiotherapy should begin as early as possible during the first chemotherapy cycle. A total radiation dose of 45 Gy is recommended, delivered in a short overall treatment time (less than 4 weeks). Accelerated therapy increased absolute 5-year survival rates by 10\% compared to longer treatment times, at the expense of an incidence of severe esophagitis of approximately 30\%, which is reversible within a few weeks. Hematological complications and late pulmonary damage may occur, but is not more frequent than with less intensive schedules that impair long-term survival. Obviously, patient selection is crucial. Because after combined chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy, the remission status of the tumor is difficult to assess because of radiation-induced radiographic changes, patients that show no tumor progression are suitable for PCI. With this treatment, 5-year survival rates of 25\% can be achieved in patients with LD-SCLC",

abstract="PURPOSE: To derive recommendations for routine practice and clinical trials for techniques used in high-dose, high-precision thoracic radiotherapy for lung cancer. METHODS: A literature search was performed to identify published articles considered both clinically relevant and practical to use. Recommendations were categorized under the following headings: patient selection, patient positioning and immobilization, tumor motion, computed tomography and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission technology scanning, generating target volumes, radiotherapy treatment planning, treatment delivery, and scoring of response and toxicity. The American College of Chest Physicians grading of recommendations was used. RESULTS: Recommendations were identified for each of the recommendation categories. Although most of the recommended techniques have not been evaluated in multicenter clinical trials, their use in high-precision thoracic radiotherapy and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) appears to be justified on the basis of available evidence. CONCLUSION: Recommendations to facilitate the clinical implementation of high-precision conformal radiotherapy and SBRT for lung tumors were identified from the literature. Some techniques that are considered investigational at present were also highlighted",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Radiobiological and physical examinations suggest clinical advantages of heavy ion irradiation. We report the results of 23 women and 22 men (median age 48 years) with skull base tumors irradiated with carbon ion beams at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI), Darmstadt, from December 1997 until September 1999. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included patients with chordomas (17), chondrosarcomas (10) and other skull base tumors (Table 1). It is the first time that the intensity-controlled rasterscan-technique and the application of positron-emission tomography (PET) for quality assurance was used. All patients had computed tomography for three-dimensional-treatment planning (Figure 1). Patients with chordomas and chondrosarcomas underwent fractionated carbon ion irradiation in 20 consecutive days (median total dose 60 GyE). Other histologies were treated with a carbon ion boost of 15 to 18 GyE delivered to the macroscopic tumor after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (median total dose 63 GyE). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 9 months. Irradiation was well tolerated by all patients. Partial tumor remission was seen in 7 patients (15.5\%) (Figure 2). One-year local control rate was 94\%. One patient (2.2\%) deceased. No severe toxicity and no local recurrence within the treated volume were observed. CONCLUSION: Clinical effectiveness and technical feasibility of this therapy modality could clearly be demonstrated in our study. To evaluate the clinical relevance of the different beam modalities studies with larger patient numbers are necessary. To continue our project a new heavy ion accelerator exclusively for clinical use is planned to be constructed in Heidelberg",

abstract="The sensitivity of the rat spinal cord to single and split doses of radiation and the resulting relative biological effectiveness (RBE) were determined for carbon-ion irradiations (12C) in the plateau and Bragg-peak regions. The cranial part of the cervical and thoracic spinal cords of 180 rats were irradiated with one or two fractions of 12C ions or photons, respectively. Dose-response curves for the end point symptomatic myelopathy were established, and the resulting values for the ED50 (dose for 50\% complication probability) were used to determine the RBEs. A median latency for myelopathy of 167 days (range, 121-288 days) was found. The ED50 values were 17.1 +/- 0.8 Gy, 24.9 +/- 0.7 Gy (one and two fractions, 12C plateau) and 13.9 +/- 0.8, 15.8 +/- 0.7 Gy (one and two fractions, 12C Bragg peak), respectively. For photons we obtained ED50 values of 24.5 +/- 0.8 Gy for single doses and 34.2 +/- 0.7 Gy when two fractions were applied. The corresponding RBEs were 1.43 +/- 0.08, 1.37 +/- 0.12 (one and two fractions, 12C plateau) and 1.76 +/- 0.05, 2.16 +/- 0.11 (one and two fractions, 12C Bragg peak), respectively. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed necrosis of the white matter in the spinal cord in all symptomatic animals. In summary, from one- and two-fraction photon, 12C plateau and Bragg-peak irradiation of the rat spinal cord, we have established RBEs as well as the individual ED50's. From the latter there is a clear indication of repair processes for fractionated photons and 12C plateau ions which are significantly reduced by using Bragg-peak ions. Additional studies are being carried with 6 and 18 fractions to further refine and define the RBE and ED50 values and estimate the alpha/beta ratios",

abstract="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of using gold seed implants in the prostate for position verification, using an a-Si flat panel imager as a detector during megavoltage irradiation of prostate carcinoma. This is a study to guarantee positioning accuracy in intensity-modulated radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients with localized prostate carcinoma (T2-3) received between one and three fiducial gold markers in the prostate. All patients were treated with 3-D conformal radiotherapy with an anterior-posterior (AP) and two lateral wedge fields. The acute gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicities were scored using common toxicity criteria scales (CTC). Using three consecutive CT scans and portal images obtained during the treatment we have studied the occurrence of any change in prostate shape (deformation), seed migration and the magnitude of translations and rotations of the prostate. RESULTS: We observed no acute major complications for prostate irradiation regarding the seed implantation. The maximum acute GU toxicity grade 2 (dysuria and frequency) was observed in seven patients during the treatment. The maximum grade 2 (diarrhoea) was scored in two patients regarding the acute GI toxicities. No significant prostate deformation could be detected in the consecutive CT scans. It appeared that the distances between the markers only slightly changed during treatment (S.D. 0.5 mm). Random prostate translations were (1 S.D.) 2.1, 3.2 and 2.2 mm in the lateral (LR), AP and cranial-caudal (CC) directions, respectively, whereas systematic translations were 3.3, 4.8 and 3.5 mm in the LR, AP and CC directions, respectively. Random prostate rotations were (1 S.D.) 3.6, 1.7 and 1.9 degrees around the LR, AP and CC axis, respectively, whereas systematic rotations were 4.7, 2.0 and 2.7 degrees around the LR, AP and CC axis, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the fiducial gold seeds are a safe and appropriate device to verify and correct the position of prostate during megavoltage irradiation. The amount of seed migration and prostate deformation is far below our present tumour delineation accuracy",

abstract="Carbon ion therapy is a type of radiotherapies that can deliver high-dose radiation to a tumor while minimizing the dose delivered to the organs at risk; this profile differs from that of photon radiotherapy. Moreover, carbon ions are classified as high-linear energy transfer radiation and are expected to be effective for even photon-resistant tumors. Recently, high-precision radiotherapy modalities such as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), proton therapy, and carbon ion therapy have been used for patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer, and the results are promising, as, for carbon ion therapy, local control and overall survival rates at 5 years are 80-90\% and 40-50\%, respectively. Carbon ion therapy may be theoretically superior to SBRT and proton therapy, but the literature that is currently available does not show a statistically significant difference among these treatments. Carbon ion therapy demonstrates a better dose distribution than both SBRT and proton therapy in most cases of early-stage lung cancer. Therefore, carbon ion therapy may be safer for treating patients with adverse conditions such as large tumors, central tumors, and poor pulmonary function. Furthermore, carbon ion therapy may also be suitable for dose escalation and hypofractionation.",

abstract="PURPOSE: The prostate is known to translate and rotate under influence of rectal filling changes and many studies have addressed the magnitude of these motions. However, prostate shape variations also have been reported. For image-guided radiotherapy, it is essential to know the relative magnitude of translations, rotations, and shape variation so that the most appropriate correction strategy can be chosen. However, no quantitative analysis of shape variation has been performed. It is, therefore, the purpose of this article to develop a method to determine shape variation of complex organs and apply it to determine shape variation during external beam radiotherapy of a GTV (gross tumor volume) consisting of prostate and seminal vesicles. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For this study, the data of 19 patients with prostate cancer were used. Each patient received a planning computed tomography (CT) scan and 8-12 (11 on average) repeat CT scans that were made during the course of conformal radiotherapy. One observer delineated the GTV in all scans, and volume variations were measured. After matching the GTVs for each patient for translation and rotation, a coverage probability matrix was constructed and the 50\% isosurface was taken to determine the average GTV surface. Perpendicular distances between the average GTV and the individual GTVs were calculated for each point of the average GTV, and their variation was expressed in terms of local standard deviation (SD). The local SDs of the shape variation of all 19 patients were mapped onto a reference case by matching and morphing of the individual average GTVs. Repeated delineation of the GTV was done for 6 patients to determine intraobserver variation. Finally, the measured shape variation was corrected for intraobserver variation to estimate the ``real'' shape variation. RESULTS: No significant variations in GTV volume were observed. The measured shape variation (including delineation variation) was largest at the tip of the vesicles (SD = 2.0 mm), smallest at the left and right side of the prostate (SD = 1.0 mm), and average elsewhere (SD = 1.5 mm). At the left, right, and cranial sides of the prostate, the intraobserver variation was of the same order of magnitude as the measured shape variation; elsewhere it was smaller. However, the accuracy of the estimated SD for intraobserver variation was about half of the accuracy of the estimated SD for the measured shape variation, giving an overall uncertainty of maximum 0.6 mm SD in the estimate of the ``real'' shape variation. The ``real'' shape variation was small at the left, right, and cranial side of the prostate (SD <0.5 mm) and between 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a method to quantify shape variation of organs with a complex shape and applied it to a GTV consisting of prostate and seminal vesicles. Deformation of prostate and seminal vesicles during the course of radiotherapy is small (relative to organ motion). Therefore, it is a valid approximation in image-guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer, in first order, to correct only for setup errors and organ motion. Prostate and seminal vesicles deformation can be considered as a second-order effect",

abstract="PURPOSE: We developed and evaluated a correction strategy for prostate rotations using direct adaptation of segments in intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). METHOD AND MATERIALS: Implanted fiducials (four gold markers) were used to determine interfractional translations, rotations, and dilations of the prostate. We used hybrid imaging: The markers were automatically detected in two pretreatment planar X-ray projections; their actual position in three-dimensional space was reconstructed from these images at first. The structure set comprising prostate, seminal vesicles, and adjacent rectum wall was transformed accordingly in 6 degrees of freedom. Shapes of IMRT segments were geometrically adapted in a class solution forward-planning approach, derived within seconds on-site and treated immediately. Intrafractional movements were followed in MV electronic portal images captured on the fly. RESULTS: In 31 of 39 patients, for 833 of 1013 fractions (supine, flat couch, knee support, comfortably full bladder, empty rectum, no intraprostatic marker migrations >2 mm of more than one marker), the online aperture adaptation allowed safe reduction of margins clinical target volume-planning target volume (prostate) down to 5 mm when only interfractional corrections were applied: Dominant L-R rotations were found to be 5.3 degrees (mean of means), standard deviation of means +/-4.9 degrees , maximum at 30.7 degrees . Three-dimensional vector translations relative to skin markings were 9.3 +/- 4.4 mm (maximum, 23.6 mm). Intrafractional movements in 7.7 +/- 1.5 min (maximum, 15.1 min) between kV imaging and last beam's electronic portal images showed further L-R rotations of 2.5 degrees +/- 2.3 degrees (maximum, 26.9 degrees ), and three-dimensional vector translations of 3.0 +/-3.7 mm (maximum, 10.2 mm). Addressing intrafractional errors could further reduce margins to 3 mm. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the clinical feasibility of an online adaptive image-guided, intensity-modulated prostate protocol on a standard linear accelerator to correct 6 degrees of freedom of internal organ motion, allowing safe and straightforward implementation of margin reduction and dose escalation",

abstract="Cardiac MRI has evolved one of the major imaging technologies in cardiology. Increasingly MRI has also been used for electrophysiological applications. Anatomically based procedures such as the circumferential pulmonary vein ablation emphasized the importance of including the individual's cardiac anatomy in a tailored ablation approach. Today, many centers routinely perform pre-ablation imaging to identify left atrial anatomy. Three-dimensional reconstructions based on MRI are frequently integrated in clinical mapping systems to provide cardiac anatomy during the ablation procedure. Similarly, MRI is a clinically very valuable tool in assessing potential ablation complications such as pulmonary vein stenosis. New innovative use of MRI is likely to occur in three areas over the next several years. During ventricular tachycardia ablations volume rendering/fusion imaging will enable a detailed three-dimensional substrate evaluation and provide supplementary scar characterization using a combination of different imaging approaches. With the ongoing technical improvements real-time MRI will likely emerge as a stand-alone clinical modality to directly guide catheter ablation procedures. The advent of stronger field strength MRI, faster imaging protocols, and improved gating techniques will allow accurate peri- and post-procedural visualization of ablation lesions. These developments should result in shorter procedure times and decreased complications rates. Ultimately, they will enable the development of novel ablation strategies and expand the current indications for electrophysiological ablations",

abstract="The CyberKnife is a complex, emerging technology that is a significant departure from current stereotactic radiosurgery and external beam radiotherapy technologies. In its clinical application and quality assurance (QA) approach, the CyberKnife is currently situated somewhere in between stereotactic radiosurgery and radiotherapy. The clinical QA for this image-guided treatment delivery system typically follows the vendor's guidance, mainly because of the current lack of vendor-independent QA recommendations. The problem has been exacerbated because very little published data are available for QA for the CyberKnife system, especially for QA of the interaction between individual system components. The tools and techniques for QA of the CyberKnife are under development and will continue to improve with longer clinical experience of the users. The technology itself continues to evolve, forcing continuous changes and adaptation of QA. To aid in the process of developing comprehensive guidance on CyberKnife QA, a database of errors based on users reporting incidents and corrective actions would be desirable. The goal of this work was to discuss the status of QA guidelines in the clinical implementation of the CyberKnife system. This investigation was done from the perspective of an active clinical and research site using the CyberKnife",

abstract="The current climate of rapid technological evolution is reflected in newer and better methods to modulate and direct radiation beams for cancer therapy. This Vision 20/20 paper focuses on part of this evolution, locating and targeting moving tumors. The two processes are somewhat independent and in principle different implementations of the locating and targeting processes can be interchanged. Advanced localization and targeting methods have an impact on treatment planning and also present new challenges for quality assurance (QA), that of verifying real-time delivery. Some methods to locate and target moving tumors with radiation beams are currently FDA approved for clinical use-and this availability and implementation will increase with time. Extensions of current capabilities will be the integration of higher order dimensionality, such as rotation and deformation in addition to translation, into the estimate of the patient pose and real-time reoptimization and adaption of delivery to the dynamically changing anatomy of cancer patients",

abstract="A new online imaging approach, linac-integrated cone beam CT (CBCT), has been developed over the past few years. It has the advantage that a patient can be examined in their treatment position directly before or during a radiotherapy treatment. Unfortunately, respiratory organ motion, one of the largest intrafractional organ motions, often leads to artefacts in the reconstructed 3D images. One way to take this into account is to register the breathing phase during image acquisition for a phase-correlated image reconstruction. Therefore, the main focus of this work is to present a system which has the potential to investigate the correlation between internal (movement of the diaphragm) and external (data of a respiratory gating system) information about breathing phase and amplitude using an inline CBCT scanner. This also includes a feasibility study about using the acquired information for a respiratory-correlated 4D CBCT reconstruction. First, a moving lung phantom was used to develop and to specify the required methods which are based on an image reconstruction using only projections belonging to a certain moving phase. For that purpose, the corresponding phase has to be detected for each projection. In the case of the phantom, an electrical signal allows one to track the movement in real time. The number of projections available for the image reconstruction depends on the breathing phase and the size of the position range from which projections should be used for the reconstruction. The narrower this range is, the better the inner structures can be located, but also the noise of the images increases due to the limited number of projections. This correlation has also been analysed. In a second step, the methods were clinically applied using data sets of patients with lung tumours. In this case, the breathing phase was detected by an external gating system (AZ-733V, Anzai Medical Co.) based on a pressure sensor attached to the patient's abdominal region with a fixation belt. The comparison of the reconstructed 4D CBCT images and the corresponding 4D CT images used for the treatment planning provides the required information for the calculation of possible setup errors. So, a repositioning of the patient is feasible even though the patient moves due to respiration. In addition to the external signal, the position of the diaphragm in the cranial-caudal direction could be extracted from each projection. Both independent sources of information show a very good agreement of the phase and even the amplitude of the movement and the external signal respectively. This suggests the usability of such a system for a gated dose delivery approach. However, more studies involving patients with different incidences have to be carried out to confirm these first results",

abstract="Respiratory organ motion is known to be one of the largest intrafractional organ motions. Therefore, it is important to investigate the potential benefit of gated dose delivery approaches which aim to account for the respective dose uncertainties. In this study respiration is simulated by a moving lung phantom; the movement is not restricted to a normal sinusoidal progression and simulates the one of the embedded lung tumour in the cranial\&ndash;caudal direction. An IMRT plan with a total of 29 beam segments was designed for the treatment of this tumour. It was irradiated in its resting position\&mdash;which is the position at exhalation\&mdash;and during movement. Furthermore the irradiation was triggered using different amplitude thresholds, which means that the irradiation only proceeded if the deviation of the tumour?s position from its resting position is smaller than the given threshold. We determined the gating-related increase of the treatment time for various gating procedures. We also measured the resulting dose distribution in specific slices of the phantom perpendicular to the direction of the movement using film dosimetry and compared it to the dose distribution of the static case. Since these film measurements cannot be done inside the whole tumour, additionally the movement and gating was simulated using the planning software to calculate the 3D dose distribution inside the tumour and to generate dose volume histograms for different treatment modalities. The total treatment time was observed to increase by 20\%\&ndash;100\% depending on the individual gating threshold and can be calculated easily. The analysis of the films showed that irradiation without gating leads to significant underdosages up to 33\%, especially at the edge of the tumour. With gating it is possible to considerably reduce this underdosage down to 9\% depending on the trigger threshold. The calculation of the dose volume histograms makes it possible to find a reasonable compromise between the improvement of the dose distribution and the increase of the treatment time",

abstract="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate prostate movement during deep breathing and contraction of abdominal musculature by means of dynamic MRI and analyze implications for image-guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 43 patients and 8 healthy volunteers were examined with MRI. Images during deep respiration and during contraction of abdominal musculature (via a coughing maneuver) were obtained with dynamic two-dimensional (2D) balanced SSFP; 3 frames/s were obtained over an acquisition time of 15 s. Images were acquired in sagittal orientation to evaluate motion along both the craniocaudal (cc)-axis and anteroposterior (ap)-axis. Prostate motion was quantified semi-automatically using dedicated software tools. RESULTS: Respiratory induced mean cc-axis displacement of the prostate was 2.7 +/- 1.9 (SD) mm (range, 0.5-10.6 mm) and mean ap-axis displacement 1.8 +/- 1.0 (SD) mm (range, 0.3-10 mm). In 69\% of the subjects, breathing-related prostate movements were found to be negligible (< 3 mm). The prostate displacement for abdominal contraction was significantly higher: mean cc-axis displacement was max. 8.4 +/- 6.7 (SD) mm (range, 0.6-27 mm); mean anteroposterior movement was 8.3 +/- 7.7 (SD) mm (range, 0.7-26 mm). CONCLUSION: Dynamic MRI is an excellent tool for noninvasive real-time imaging of prostate movement. Further investigations regarding possible applications in image-guided radiotherapy, e.g., for individualized planning and in integrated linac/MRI systems, are warranted",

abstract="Relative motion between a tumor and a scanning proton beam results in a degradation of the dose distribution (interplay effect). This study investigates the relationship between beam scanning parameters and the interplay effect, with the goal of finding parameters that minimize interplay. 4D Monte Carlo simulations of pencil beam scanning proton therapy treatments were performed using the 4DCT geometry of five lung cancer patients of varying tumor size (50.4-167.1 cc) and motion amplitude (2.9-30.1 mm). Treatments were planned assuming delivery in 35 x 2.5 Gy(RBE) fractions. The spot size, time to change the beam energy (taues), time required for magnet settling (tauss), initial breathing phase, spot spacing, scanning direction, scanning speed, beam current and patient breathing period were varied for each of the five patients. Simulations were performed for a single fraction and an approximation of conventional fractionation. For the patients considered, the interplay effect could not be predicted using the superior-inferior motion amplitude alone. Larger spot sizes (sigma {\textasciitilde} 9-16 mm) were less susceptible to interplay, giving an equivalent uniform dose (EUD) of 99.0 +/- 4.4\% (1 standard deviation) in a single fraction compared to 86.1 +/- 13.1\% for smaller spots (sigma {\textasciitilde} 2-4 mm). The smaller spot sizes gave EUD values as low as 65.3\% of the prescription dose in a single fraction. Reducing the spot spacing improved the target dose homogeneity. The initial breathing phase can have a significant effect on the interplay, particularly for shorter delivery times. No clear benefit was evident when scanning either parallel or perpendicular to the predominant axis of motion. Longer breathing periods decreased the EUD. In general, longer delivery times led to lower interplay effects. Conventional fractionation showed significant improvement in terms of interplay, giving a EUD of at least 84.7\% and 100.0\% of the prescription dose for the small and larger spot sizes respectively. The interplay effect is highly patient specific, depending on the motion amplitude, tumor location and the delivery parameters. Large degradations of the dose distribution in a single fraction were observed, but improved significantly using conventional fractionation",

DVHs show promise as tools for comparing rival treatment plans for a specific patient by clearly presenting the uniformity of dose in the target volume and any hot spots in adjacent normal organs or tissues. However, because of the loss of positional information in the volume(s) under consideration, it should not be the sole criterion for plan evaluation. DVHs can also be used as input data to estimate tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). The sensitivity of TCP and NTCP calculations to small changes in the DVH shape points to the need for an accurate method for computing DVHs. We present a discussion of the methodology for generating and plotting the DVHs, some caveats, limitations on their use and the general experience of four hospitals using DVHs",

Particle therapy is an emerging technique in radiotherapy. Protons and carbon ions have been used for treating many different solid cancers, and several new centers with large accelerators are under construction.

The purpose of the present study was to measure the changes in three-dimensional liver tumor motion with and without compression using cine-magnetic resonance imaging. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 60 patients treated as a part of an institutional research ethics board-approved liver stereotactic body radiotherapy protocol underwent cine T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging through the tumor centroid in the coronal and sagittal planes. A total of 240 cine-magnetic resonance imaging sequences acquired at one to three images each second for 30-60 s were evaluated using an in-house-developed template matching tool (based on the coefficient correlation) to measure the magnitude of the tumor motion. The average tumor edge displacements were used to determine the magnitude of changes in the caudal-cranial (CC) and anteroposterior (AP) directions, with and without AC. RESULTS: The mean tumor motion without AC of 11.7 mm (range, 4.8-23.3) in the CC direction was reduced to 9.4 mm (range, 1.6-23.4) with AC. The tumor motion was reduced in both directions (CC and AP) in 52\% of the patients and in a single direction (CC or AP) in 90\% of the patients. The mean decrease in tumor motion with AC was 2.3 and 0.6 mm in the CC and AP direction, respectively. Increased motion occurred in one or more directions in 28\% of patients. Clinically significant (>3 mm) decreases were observed in 40\% and increases in <2\% of patients in the CC direction. CONCLUSION: AC can significantly reduce three-dimensional liver tumor motion in most patients, although the magnitude of the reduction was smaller than previously reported",

abstract="Background: The planning target volume in radiotherapy treatment planning takes into account both movements of the clinical target volume (CTV) and set-up deviations.Materials and methods: A group of patients who received radiotherapy for lung cancer were studied. In order to measure the CTV movements due to respiration and other internal organ motions, fluoroscopy was performed for 20 patients. To study the accuracy and reproducibility of patient and beam set-up, 553 electronic portal images from 20 patients were evaluated. Discrepancies between planned and actual field positions were measured and the systematic and random errors were identified. The combined effect of these geometrical variations was evaluated.Results: The average CTV movement with quiet respiration was about 2.4 mm in the medio-lateral and dorso-ventral directions. Movement in the cranio-caudal direction was on average 3.9 mm with a range of 0-12 mm. The systematic set-up errors were on average 2.0 mm in the transversal plane and 3.0 mm in the cranio-caudal direction. The random errors can be described by their standard deviations of 3.2 and 2.6 mm. In this study, the combined effect of the two parameters (CTV movement and set-up deviations) varied between 7.5 and 10.3 mm in different anatomical directions.Conclusions: In our daily clinical routine, we use a margin of 11 mm in the transversal plane and 15 mm cranially and caudally, also taking into account other unquantified variations and uncertainties",

abstract="Motion mitigation strategies are needed to fully realize the theoretical advantages of scanned ion beam therapy for patients with moving tumors. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a new four-dimensional (4D) optimization approach for scanned-ion-beam tracking could reduce dose to avoidance volumes near a moving target while maintaining target dose coverage, compared to an existing 3D-optimized beam tracking approach. We tested these approaches computationally using a simple 4D geometrical phantom and a complex anatomic phantom, that is, a 4D computed tomogram of the thorax of a lung cancer patient. We also validated our findings using measurements of carbon-ion beams with a motorized film phantom. Relative to 3D-optimized beam tracking, 4D-optimized beam tracking reduced the maximum predicted dose to avoidance volumes by 53\% in the simple phantom and by 13\% in the thorax phantom. 4D-optimized beam tracking provided similar target dose homogeneity in the simple phantom (standard deviation of target dose was 0.4\% versus 0.3\%) and dramatically superior homogeneity in the thorax phantom (D5-D95 was 1.9\% versus 38.7\%). Measurements demonstrated that delivery of 4D-optimized beam tracking was technically feasible and confirmed a 42\% decrease in maximum film exposure in the avoidance region compared with 3D-optimized beam tracking. In conclusion, we found that 4D-optimized beam tracking can reduce the maximum dose to avoidance volumes near a moving target while maintaining target dose coverage, compared with 3D-optimized beam tracking",

Single strand breaks (SSBs) and double strand breaks (DSBs) are distributed stochastically onto the DNA molecule and additional DSBs are recorded. Consideration of this additional damage leads to a modification of the underlying photon survival curve at high doses. As a consequence of the new approach, the ratio of maximum relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values to minimum RBEs is increased. This can be understood in terms of a higher radiation effect resulting from the cluster damage at high local doses. We find that the extended LEM including cluster effects reproduces experimental data for V79 cells significantly better than the original LEM",

Here we present an extension of the model that takes cluster effects of single-strand breaks (SSBs) at the nanometer scale into account. In line with the main idea of the local effect model, we take the yields of SSBs and double-strand breaks (DSBs) from experimental photon data and use a Monte Carlo method to distribute them onto the DNA. We score clusters of SSBs where individual SSBs are separated by less than 25 bp as additional DSBs. Assuming that the number of DSBs is a measure of cell lethality, we derive a modified cell survival curve for photons that takes these cluster effects into account. In combination with an improved radial dose distribution, we find that the extended local effect model including cluster effects reproduces most experimental data better than the original local effect model and thus enhances the accuracy of the local effect model",

abstract="PURPOSE: To analyze the accuracy of relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) values for treatment planning in carbon ion radiotherapy based on the local effect model (LEM) and to discuss the implications on the clinically relevant depth dose profiles. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Predictions of the LEM are compared with a broad panel of experimental data in vitro and to the tolerance of the rat spinal cord in vivo. To improve the accuracy of the LEM, the description of track structure is modified by taking into account a velocity-dependent extension of the inner part of the track. RESULTS: The original version of the LEM (LEM I) underestimates the therapeutic ratio of carbon ions (i.e., the ratio of RBE in the Bragg peak region as compared with the RBE in the entrance channel). Although significantly reduced, the cluster extension of the LEM (LEM II) still shows the same tendency. Implementation of the modified track structure (LEM III) almost completely compensates these systematic deviations, and predictions of RBE by LEM III for high and low energetic carbon ions show good agreement for a wide panel of different cell lines, as well as for the tolerance of the rat spinal cord. As a consequence, the expected RBE in the normal tissue surrounding the tumor becomes significantly lower than estimated with the LEM in its original version (LEM I). CONCLUSIONS: The modified track structure description represents an empiric approach to improve the accuracy of the LEM for treatment planning. This will be particularly useful for further optimization of carbon ion therapy in general and with respect to comparison with other treatment modalities, such as protons or intensity-modulated radiotherapy",

We present an approach that determines the fragment length distributions of plasmid DNA after heavy-ion irradiation by using the Local Effect Model. We find a good agreement of our simulations with experimental fragment distributions derived from atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies by including experimental constraints typical for AFM. Our calculations reveal that by comparing the fragmentation in terms of fluence, we can uniquely distinguish the effect of different radiation qualities. For very high-LET irradiation using nickel or uranium ions, no difference between their fragment distributions can be expected for the same dose level. However, for carbon ions with an intermediate LET, the fragmentation pattern differs from the distribution for very high-LET particles. The results of the model calculations can be used to determine the optimal experimental parameters for a demonstration of the influence of track structure on primary radiation damage. Additionally, we compare the results of our model for two different plasmid geometries",

abstract="Heavy-ion radiotherapy exploits the high biological effectiveness of localized energy deposition delivered by so-called Bragg-peak particles. Recent publications have challenged the established procedures to calculate biological effective dose distributions in treatment planning. They emphasize the importance of very low energy (<500 keV amu(-1)) ions, either as primary particles or originating from molecular and nuclear fragmentations. We show, however, that slow heavy ions with energies below 500 keV amu(-1) only play a negligible role in cancer treatments for several reasons. Their residual range is very small compared to the relevant length scale of treatment planning. Moreover, their relative frequency and also their relative dose distribution are insignificant, since energy loss and range straggling in ion slowing down processes as well as the necessary superposition of Bragg peaks wash out small-scale special effects.  Additionally, we show that even a 1000 times larger biological damage of such slow ions would not result in a clinically relevant increase of the photon-equivalent dose. Therefore, neither a more precise physical description of ions in the very distal part of the Bragg peak nor the consideration of radiation damage induced by hyperthermal ions would result in a meaningful improvement of current models for heavy-ion treatment planning.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To present the first direct experimental in vitro comparison of the biological effectiveness of range-equivalent protons and carbon ion beams for Chinese hamster ovary cells exposed in a three-dimensional phantom using a pencil beam scanning technique and to compare the experimental data with a novel biophysical model. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Cell survival was measured in the phantom after irradiation with two opposing fields, thus mimicking the typical patient treatment scenario. The novel biophysical model represents a substantial extension of the local effect model, previously used for treatment planning in carbon ion therapy for more than 400 patients, and potentially can be used to predict effectiveness of all ion species relevant for radiotherapy. A key feature of the new approach is the more sophisticated consideration of spatially correlated damage induced by ion irradiation. RESULTS: The experimental data obtained for Chinese hamster ovary cells clearly demonstrate that higher cell killing is achieved in the target region with carbon ions as compared with protons when the effects in the entrance channel are comparable. The model predictions demonstrate agreement with these experimental data and with data obtained with helium ions under similar conditions. Good agreement is also achieved with relative biological effectiveness values reported in the literature for other cell lines for monoenergetic proton, helium, and carbon ions. CONCLUSION: Both the experimental data and the new modeling approach are supportive of the advantages of carbon ions as compared with protons for treatment-like field configurations. Because the model predicts the effectiveness for several ion species with similar accuracy, it represents a powerful tool for further optimization and utilization of the potential of ion beams in tumor therapy",

pages="95--105",
abstract="Background and purpose: To assess the impact of both set-up errors and respiration-induced tumor motion on the cumulative dose delivered to a clinical target volume (CTV) in lung, for an irradiation based on current clinically applied field sizes.Materials and methods: A cork phantom, having a 50 mm spherically shaped polystyrene insertion to simulate a gross tumor volume (GTV) located centrally in a lung was irradiated with two parallel opposed beams. The planned 95\% isodose surface was conformed to the planning target volume (PTV) using a multi leaf collimator. The resulting margin between the CTV and the field edge was 16 mm in beam?s eye view. A dose of 70 Gy was prescribed. Dose area histograms (DAHs) of the central plane of the CTV (GTV+5 mm) were determined using radiographic film for different combinations of set-up errors and respiration-induced tumor motion. The DAHs were evaluated using the population averaged tumor control probability (TCPpop) and the equivalent uniform dose (EUD) model.Results: Compared with dose volume histograms of the entire CTV, DAHs overestimate the impact of tumor motion on tumor control. Due to the choice of field sizes a large part of the PTV will receive a too low dose resulting in an EUD of the central plane of the CTV of 68.9 Gy for the static case. The EUD drops to 68.2, 66.1 and 51.1 Gy for systematic set-up errors of 5, 10 and 15 mm, respectively. For random set-up errors of 5, 10 and 15 mm (1 SD), the EUD decreases to 68.7, 67.4 and 64.9 Gy, respectively. For similar amplitudes of respiration-induced motion, the EUD decreases to 68.8, 68.5 and 67.7 Gy, respectively. For a clinically relevant scenario of 7.5 mm systematic set-up error, 3 mm random set-up error and 5 mm amplitude of breathing motion, the EUD is 66.7 Gy. This corresponds with a tumor control probability TCPpop of 41.7\%, compared with 50.0\% for homogeneous irradiation of the CTV to 70 Gy.Conclusion: Systematic set-up errors have a dominant effect on the cumulative dose to the CTV. The effect of breathing motion and random set-up errors is smaller. Therefore the gain of controlling breathing motion during irradiation is expected to be small and efforts should rather focus on minimizing systematic errors. For the current clinically applied field sizes and a clinically relevant combination of set-up errors and breathing motion, the EUD of the central plane of the CTV is reduced by 3.3 Gy, at maximum, relative to homogeneous irradiation of the CTV to 70 Gy, for our worst case scenario",

pages="477--490",
abstract="We determined the relationship between intra-fractional breathing motion and safety margins, using daily real-time tumour tracking data of 40 patients (43 tumour locations), treated with radiosurgery at Hokkaido University. We limited our study to the dose-blurring effect of intra-fractional breathing motion, and did not consider differences in positioning accuracy or systematic errors. The additional shift in the prescribed isodose level (e.g. 95\%) was determined by convolving a one-dimensional dose profile, having a dose gradient representing an 8 MV beam through either lung or water, with the probability density function (PDF) of breathing. This additional shift is a measure for the additional margin that should be applied in order to maintain the same probability of tumour control as without intra-fractional breathing. We show that the required safety margin is a nonlinear function of the peak-to-peak breathing motion. Only a small reduction in the shift of isodose curves was observed for breathing motion up to 10 mm. For larger motion, 20 or 30 mm, control of patient breathing during irradiation, using either gating or breath hold, can allow a substantial reduction in safety margins of about 7 or 12 mm depending on the dose gradient prior to blurring. Clinically relevant random setup uncertainties, which also have a blurring effect on the dose distribution, have only a small effect on the margin needed for intra-fractional breathing motion. Because of the one-dimensional nature of our analysis, the resulting margins are mainly applicable in the superior\&ndash;inferior direction. Most measured breathing PDFs were not consistent with the PDF of a simple parametric curve such as cos\$^4\$, either because of irregular breathing or base-line shifts. Instead, our analysis shows that breathing motion can be modelled as Gaussian with a standard deviation of about 0.4 times the peak-to-peak breathing motion",

abstract="We performed a treatment planning study in order to gather basic insight in the effect of setup errors and breathing motion on the cumulative proton dose to a lung tumor. We used a simplified geometry that simulates a 50 mm diameter gross tumor volume (GTV) located centrally inside lung tissue. The GTV was expanded with a uniform 5 mm margin into a clinical target volume (CTV) and into a variety of planning target volume (PTV's). Proton beam apertures were designed to conform the prescribed dose laterally to the PTV while the range compensator was designed to provide distal coverage of the CTV. Different smearing distances were applied to the range compensators, and the cumulative dose in the CTV was evaluated for different combinations of breathing motion and systematic setup errors. Evaluation parameters were the dose to 99\% of the CTV (D99) and the equivalent uniform dose (EUD), with a surviving fraction at 2 Gy of SF2 = 0.5. For a single proton field designed to a 15 mm expansion of the CTV and without smearing applied to the range compensator, D99 of the CTV reduced from 96\% for no tumor displacement to 41\% and 13\% for systematic setup errors of 5 and 10 mm, respectively. For a representative clinical combination, of 5 mm systematic error and 10 mm breathing amplitude, the EUD of the CTV was about 40 Gy (prescribed dose 70 Gy) regardless the CTV to PTV margin, and without smearing. Smearing the range compensator increases the dose to the CTV substantially with a lateral margin and smearing distance of 7.5 mm providing ample tumor coverage. In this latter case, D99 of the target volume increased to 87\% for a single field treatment plan. Smearing does, however, lead to an increase in dose to normal tissues distal to the clinical target volume. Next to countering geometric mismatches due to patient setup, smearing can also be used to counter the detrimental effects of breathing motion on the dose to the clinical target volume. We show that the lateral margin and smearing distance can be substantially smaller than the maximum tumor displacement due to setup errors and patient breathing, as measured by the D99 and the EUD",

abstract="PURPOSE: In proton radiotherapy, respiration-induced variations in density lead to changes in radiologic path lengths and will possibly result in geometric misses. We compared different treatment planning strategies for lung tumors that compensate for respiratory motion. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Particle-specific treatment planning margins were applied to standard helical computed tomography (CT) scans as well as to ``representative'' CT scans. Margins were incorporated beam specific laterally by aperture widening and longitudinally by compensator smearing. Furthermore, treatment plans using full time-resolved 4D-computed tomography data were generated. RESULTS: Four-dimensional treatment planning guaranteed target coverage throughout a respiratory cycle. Use of a standard helical CT data set resulted in underdosing the target volume to 36\% of the prescribed dose. For CT data representing average target positions, coverage can be expected but not guaranteed. In comparison to this strategy, 4D planning decreased the mean lung dose by up to 16\% and the lung volume receiving 20 Gy (prescribed target dose 72 Gy) by up to 15\%. CONCLUSION: When the three planning strategies are compared, only 4D proton treatment planning guarantees delivery of the prescribed dose throughout a respiratory cycle. Furthermore, the 4D planning approach results in equal or reduced dose to critical structures; even the ipsilateral lung is spared",

abstract="PURPOSE: Common practice in proton radiotherapy is to deliver a subset of all fields in the treatment plan on any given treatment day. We investigate using biological modeling if the resulting variation in daily dose to normal tissues has a relevant detrimental biological effect. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For four patient groups, the cumulative normalized total dose (NTD) was determined for normal tissues (OARs) of each patient using the clinically delivered fractionation schedule (FS(clin)), and for hypothetical fractionation schedules delivering all fields every day (FS(all)) or only a single field each day (FS(single)). Cumulative three-dimensional NTD distributions were summarized using the generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) model. RESULTS: For the skull base/cervical spine chordoma group, the largest effect is a 4-Gy increase in gEUD of the chiasm when treating only a subset of fields on any day. For lung cancer and pancreatic cancer patients, the variation in the gEUD of normal tissues is <0.2 Gy. For the prostate group, FS(clin) increases the gEUD of the femoral heads by 9 Gy compared with FS(all). Use of FS(single) resulted in the highest NTD to normal tissues for any patient. FS(all) resulted in an integral NTD to the patient that is on average 5\% lower than FS(clin) and 10\% lower than FS(single). CONCLUSION: The effects of field set of the day treatment delivery depend on the tumor site and number of fields treated each day. Modeling these effects may be important for accurate risk assessment",

abstract="The goal of radiation therapy is to achieve maximal therapeutic benefit expressed in terms of a high probability of local control of disease with minimal side effects. Physically this often equates to the delivery of a high dose of radiation to the tumour or target region whilst maintaining an acceptably low dose to other tissues, particularly those adjacent to the target. Techniques such as intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), stereotactic radiosurgery and computer planned brachytherapy provide the means to calculate the radiation dose delivery to achieve the desired dose distribution. Imaging is an essential tool in all state of the art planning and delivery techniques: (i) to enable planning of the desired treatment, (ii) to verify the treatment is delivered as planned and (iii) to follow-up treatment outcome to monitor that the treatment has had the desired effect. Clinical imaging techniques can be loosely classified into anatomic methods which measure the basic physical characteristics of tissue such as their density and biological imaging techniques which measure functional characteristics such as metabolism. In this review we consider anatomical imaging techniques. Biological imaging is considered in another article. Anatomical imaging is generally used for goals (i) and (ii) above. Computed tomography (CT) has been the mainstay of anatomical treatment planning for many years, enabling some delineation of soft tissue as well as radiation attenuation estimation for dose prediction. Magnetic resonance imaging is fast becoming widespread alongside CT, enabling superior soft-tissue visualization. Traditionally scanning for treatment planning has relied on the use of a single snapshot scan. Recent years have seen the development of techniques such as 4D CT and adaptive radiotherapy (ART). In 4D CT raw data are encoded with phase information and reconstructed to yield a set of scans detailing motion through the breathing, or cardiac, cycle. In ART a set of scans is taken on different days. Both allow planning to account for variability intrinsic to the patient. Treatment verification has been carried out using a variety of technologies including: MV portal imaging, kV portal/fluoroscopy, MVCT, conebeam kVCT, ultrasound and optical surface imaging. The various methods have their pros and cons. The four x-ray methods involve an extra radiation dose to normal tissue. The portal methods may not generally be used to visualize soft tissue, consequently they are often used in conjunction with implanted fiducial markers. The two CT-based methods allow measurement of inter-fraction variation only. Ultrasound allows soft-tissue measurement with zero dose but requires skilled interpretation, and there is evidence of systematic differences between ultrasound and other data sources, perhaps due to the effects of the probe pressure. Optical imaging also involves zero dose but requires good correlation between the target and the external measurement and thus is often used in conjunction with an x-ray method. The use of anatomical imaging in radiotherapy allows treatment uncertainties to be determined. These include errors between the mean position at treatment and that at planning (the systematic error) and the day-to-day variation in treatment set-up (the random error). Positional variations may also be categorized in terms of inter- and intra-fraction errors. Various empirical treatment margin formulae and intervention approaches exist to determine the optimum strategies for treatment in the presence of these known errors. Other methods exist to try to minimize error margins drastically including the currently available breath-hold techniques and the tracking methods which are largely in development. This paper will review anatomical imaging techniques in radiotherapy and how they are used to boost the therapeutic benefit of the treatment",

abstract="PURPOSE: To compare three different methods of propagating the gross tumor volume (GTV) through the respiratory phases that constitute a four-dimensional computed tomography image data set. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four-dimensional computed tomography data sets of 20 patients who had undergone definitive hypofractionated radiotherapy to the lung were acquired. The GTV regions of interest (ROIs) were manually delineated on each phase of the four-dimensional computed tomography data set. The ROI from the end-expiration phase was propagated to the remaining nine phases of respiration using the following three techniques: (1) rigid-image registration using in-house software, (2) rigid image registration using research software from a commercial radiotherapy planning system vendor, and (3) rigid-image registration followed by deformable adaptation originally intended for organ-at-risk delineation using the same software. The internal GTVs generated from the various propagation methods were compared with the manual internal GTV using the normalized Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) index. RESULTS: The normalized DSC index of 1.01 +/- 0.06 (SD) for rigid propagation using the in-house software program was identical to the normalized DSC index of 1.01 +/- 0.06 for rigid propagation achieved with the vendor's research software. Adaptive propagation yielded poorer results, with a normalized DSC index of 0.89 +/- 0.10 (paired t test, p <0.001). CONCLUSION: Propagation of the GTV ROIs through the respiratory phases using rigid- body registration is an acceptable method within a 1-mm margin of uncertainty. The adaptive organ-at-risk propagation method was not applicable to propagating GTV ROIs, resulting in an unacceptable reduction of the volume and distortion of the ROIs",

abstract="We developed an efficient technique to auto-propagate parotid gland contours from planning kVCT to daily MVCT images of head-and-neck cancer patients treated with helical tomotherapy. The method deformed a 3D surface mesh constructed from manual kVCT contours by B-spline free-form deformation to generate optimal and smooth contours. Deformation was calculated by elastic image registration between kVCT and MVCT images. Data from ten head-and-neck cancer patients were considered and manual contours by three observers were included in both kVCT and MVCT images. A preliminary inter-observer variability analysis demonstrated the importance of contour propagation in tomotherapy application: a high variability was reported in MVCT parotid volume estimation (p = 0.0176, ANOVA test) and a larger uncertainty of MVCT contouring compared with kVCT was demonstrated by DICE and volume variability indices (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 10(-4) for both indices). The performance analysis of our method showed no significant differences between automatic and manual contours in terms of volumes (p > 0.05, in a multiple comparison Tukey test), center-of-mass distances (p = 0.3043, ANOVA test), DICE values (p = 0.1672, Wilcoxon signed rank test) and average and maximum symmetric distances (p = 0.2043, p = 0.8228 Wilcoxon signed rank tests). Results suggested that our contour propagation method could successfully substitute human contouring on MVCT images",

The SBRT treatment dose of 60-66 Gy was prescribed to the 80\% isodose volume in three fractions. RESULTS:Median follow-up was 50.2 months (range, 1.4-64.8 months). Kaplan-Meier local control at 3 years was 88.1\%. Regional (nodal) and distant recurrence occurred in 6 (8.6\%) and 9 (12.9\%) patients, respectively. Median survival (MS) was 32.4 months and 3-year overall survival (OS) was 42.7\% (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 31.1-54.3\%). Cancer-specific survival at 3 years was 81.7\% (95\% CI, 70.0-93.4\%).

abstract="PURPOSE: This retrospective analysis was performed to assess the outcomes of three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy and two-dimensional (2D) planning. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1978 and 2003, 200 patients with Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were treated with radiotherapy alone at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Eighty-five patients were treated with 3D conformal radiotherapy. For the 3D group, median age, radiation dose, and follow-up was 73 (range, 50-92), 66 Gy (range, 45-90.3 Gy), and 19 months (range, 3-77 months), respectively; and for the 2D group, 69 (range, 44-88), 64 Gy (range, 20-74 Gy), 20 months (range, 1-173 months), respectively. Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), disease-free survival (DFS), locoregional control (LRC), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) rates were analyzed. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in patient and tumor characteristics between 2D and 3D groups, except the 3D patients were older (p = 0.006). The OS, DSS, and LRC rates were significantly higher in patients who were treated by 3D conformal radiotherapy. Two- and 5-year OS for the 3D group were 68\% and 36\%, respectively, and 47\% and 10\% in the 2D group (p = 0.001). DSS at 2 and 5 years for the 3D group were 83\% and 68\%, respectively, vs. 62\% and 29\% in the 2D group (p < 0.001). LRC rates at 2 and 5 years for patients in the 3D group were 77\% and 70\% and 53\% and 34\% in the 2D group (p < 0.001). On univariate analysis elective, nodal irradiation was associated with decreased OS, DSS, and LRC. On multivariate analysis, 3D conformal radiotherapy was associated with increased OS and DSS. Male sex, age > or =70, weight loss > or =5\%, and tumor size > or =4 cm were associated with decreased OS and DSS. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that 3D conformal radiotherapy improves outcomes in patients with medically inoperable Stage I NSCLC compared with 2D treatment and is an acceptable treatment for this group of patients",

abstract="A proton beam delivery system on a gantry with continuous uniform scanning and dose layer stacking at the Midwest Proton Radiotherapy Institute has been commissioned and accepted for clinical use. This paper was motivated by a lack of guidance on the testing and characterization for clinical uniform scanning systems. As such, it describes how these tasks were performed with a uniform scanning beam delivery system. This paper reports the methods used and important dosimetric characteristics of radiation fields produced by the system. The commissioning data include the transverse and longitudinal dose distributions, penumbra, and absolute dose values. Using a 208 MeV cyclotron's proton beam, the system provides field sizes up to 20 and 30 cm in diameter for proton ranges in water up to 27 and 20 cm, respectively. The dose layer stacking method allows for the flexible construction of spread-out Bragg peaks with uniform modulation of up to 15 cm in water, at typical dose rates of 1-3 Gy/min. For measuring relative dose distributions, multielement ion chamber arrays, small-volume ion chambers, and radiographic films were employed. Measurements during the clinical commissioning of the system have shown that the lateral and longitudinal dose uniformity of 2.5\% or better can be achieved for all clinically important field sizes and ranges. The measured transverse penumbra widths offer a slight improvement in comparison to those achieved with a double scattering beam spreading technique at the facility. Absolute dose measurements were done using calibrated ion chambers, thermoluminescent and alanine detectors. Dose intercomparisons conducted using various types of detectors traceable to a national standards laboratory indicate that the measured dosimetry data agree with each other within 5\%",

abstract="The aim of this study is the development and experimental testing of a tumor tracking method for particle radiation therapy, providing the daily respiratory dynamics of the patient's thoraco-abdominal anatomy as a function of an external surface surrogate combined with an a priori motion model. The proposed tracking approach is based on a patient-specific breathing motion model, estimated from the four-dimensional (4D) planning computed tomography (CT) through deformable image registration. The model is adapted to the interfraction baseline variations in the patient's anatomical configuration. The driving amplitude and phase parameters are obtained intrafractionally from a respiratory surrogate signal derived from the external surface displacement. The developed technique was assessed on a dataset of seven lung cancer patients, who underwent two repeated 4D CT scans. The first 4D CT was used to build the respiratory motion model, which was tested on the second scan. The geometric accuracy in localizing lung lesions, mediated over all breathing phases, ranged between 0.6 and 1.7 mm across all patients. Errors in tracking the surrounding organs at risk, such as lungs, trachea and esophagus, were lower than 1.3 mm on average. The median absolute variation in water equivalent path length (WEL) within the target volume did not exceed 1.9 mm-WEL for simulated particle beams. A significant improvement was achieved compared with error compensation based on standard rigid alignment. The present work can be regarded as a feasibility study for the potential extension of tumor tracking techniques in particle treatments. Differently from current tracking methods applied in conventional radiotherapy, the proposed approach allows for the dynamic localization of all anatomical structures scanned in the planning CT, thus providing complete information on density and WEL variations required for particle beam range adaptation",

abstract="The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is related to age. Anticoagulation is highly effective in preventing stroke in patients with AF, but the risk of hemorrhage may be increased in older patients. We reviewed the available epidemiologic data to define the age and sex distribution of people with AF. From four large recent population-based surveys, we estimated the overall age- and gender-specific prevalence of AF. These estimates were applied to the recent US census data to calculate the number of men and women with AF in each age group. There are an estimated 2.2 million people in the United States with AF, with a median age of about 75 years. The prevalence of AF is 2.3\% in people older than 40 years and 5.9\% in those older than 65 years. Approximately 70\% of individuals with AF are between 65 and 85 years of age. The absolute number of men and women with AF is about equal. After age 75 years, about 60\% of the people with AF are women. In contrast to people with AF in the general population, patients with AF in recent anticoagulation trials had a mean age of 69 years, and only 20\% were older than 75 years. The risks and benefits of antithrombotic therapy in older individuals are important considerations in stroke prevention in AF",

abstract="PURPOSE: To determine the rate and magnitude of late genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities after salvage or adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) for prostate cancer, and to determine predictive factors for these toxicities. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A large multi-institutional database that included 959 men who received postoperative RT after radical prostatectomy (RP) was analyzed: 19\% received adjuvant RT, 81\% received salvage RT, 78\% were treated to the prostate bed only, and 22\% received radiation to the pelvis. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 55 months. At 5 years, 10\% of patients had Grade 2 late GU toxicity and 1\% had Grade 3 late GU toxicity, while 4\% of patients had Grade 2 late GI toxicity and 0.4\% had Grade 3 late GI toxicity. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that adjuvant RT (p = 0.03), androgen deprivation (p < 0.0001), and prostate bed-only RT (p = 0.007) predicted for Grade 2 or higher late GU toxicity. For GI toxicity, although adjuvant RT was significant in the univariate analysis, no significant factors were found in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the number of high-grade toxicities for postoperative RT was low. Therefore, adjuvant and salvage RT can safely be used in the appropriate settings",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Monitoring the evolution of the cancer burden in Europe is of great value. Estimates of the cancer burden in Europe have been published for 2004 and estimates are now being presented for cancer incidence and mortality in Europe for 2006. METHODS: The most recent sources of cancer incidence and mortality data have been collected and projections have been carried out using short-term prediction methods to produce estimated rates for 2006. Additional estimation was required where national incidence data were not available, and the method involved the projection of the aggregations of cancer incidence and mortality data from representative cancer registries. The estimated 2006 rates were applied to the corresponding estimated country population to obtain the best estimates of the cancer incidence and mortality in Europe in 2006. RESULTS: In 2006 in Europe, there were an estimated 3,191,600 cancer cases diagnosed (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers) and 1,703,000 deaths from cancer. The most common form of cancers was breast cancer (429,900 cases, 13.5\% of all cancer cases), followed by colorectal cancers (412,900, 12.9\%) and lung cancer (386,300, 12.1\%). Lung cancer, with an estimated 334,800 deaths (19.7\% of total), was the most common cause of death from cancer, followed by colorectal (207,400 deaths), breast (131,900) and stomach (118,200) cancers. CONCLUSIONS: The total number of new cases of cancer in Europe appears to have increased by 300,000 since 2004. With an estimated 3.2 million new cases (53\% occurring in men, 47\% in women) and 1.7 million deaths (56\% in men, 44\% in women) each year, cancer remains an important public health problem in Europe and the ageing of the European population will cause these numbers to continue to increase even if age-specific rates remain constant. Evidence-based public health measures exist to reduce the mortality of breast and colorectal cancer while the incidence of lung cancer, and several other forms of cancer, could be diminished by improved tobacco control",

abstract="We present a critical analysis of the conformity indices described in the literature and an evaluation of their field of application. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, with or without intensity modulation, is based on medical imaging techniques, three-dimensional dosimetry software, compression accessories, and verification procedures. It consists of delineating target volumes and critical healthy tissues to select the best combination of beams. This approach allows better adaptation of the isodose to the tumor volume, while limiting irradiation of healthy tissues. Tools must be developed to evaluate the quality of proposed treatment plans. Dosimetry software provides the dose distribution in each CT section and dose-volume histograms without really indicating the degree of conformity. The conformity index is a complementary tool that attributes a score to a treatment plan or that can compare several treatment plans for the same patient. The future of conformal index in everyday practice therefore remains unclear",

abstract="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Accurate contouring of the clinical target volume (CTV) is a fundamental prerequisite for successful conformal radiotherapy of prostate cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate intra- and inter-observer variability in contouring prostate (P) and seminal vesicles (SV) and its impact on conformal treatment planning in our working conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inter-observer variability was investigated by asking five well-trained radiotherapists of contouring on CT images the P and the SV of six supine-positioned patients previously treated with conformal techniques. Short-term intra-observer variability was assessed by asking the radiotherapists to contour the P and SV of one patient for a second time, just after the first contouring. The differences among the inserted volumes were considered for both intra- and inter-observer variability. Regarding intra-observer variability, the differences between the two inserted contours were estimated by taking the relative differences in correspondence to the CT slices on BEV plots (antero-posterior and left-right beams). Concerning inter-observer variability, the distances between the internal and external envelopes of the inserted contours (named projected diagnostic uncertainties or PDUs) and the distances from the mean inserted contours (named mean contour distances or MCDs) were measured from BEV plots (i.e. parallel to the CT slices). RESULTS: Intra-observer variability was relatively small (the average percentage variation of the volume was approximately 5\%; SD of the differences measured on BEV plots within 1.8 mm). Concerning inter-observer variability, the percentage SD of the inserted volumes ranged from 10 to 18\%. Differences equal to 1 cm in the cranio-caudal extension of P + SV were found in four out of six patients. The largest inter-observer variability was found when considering the anterior margin in the left-right beam of P top (MCD = 7.1 mm, 1 SD). Relatively high values for MCDs were also found for P bottom, for the posterior and lateral margins of P top (2.6 and 3.1 mm, respectively, I SD) and for the anterior margin of SV (2.8 mm, 1 SD). Relatively small values were found for P central (from 1.4 to 2.0 mm, 1 SD) and the posterior margin of SV (1.5 mm, 1 SD). CONCLUSIONS: The application of larger margins taking inter-observer variability into account should be taken into consideration for the anterior and the lateral margins of SV and P top and for the lateral margin of P. The impact of short-term intra-observer variability does not seem to be relevant",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Recent investigations showed some correlation between three-dimensional (3D) treatment planning dose-volume data (dose-volume histograms: DVH, dose statistics) and rectal toxicity for patients treated for prostate cancer. However, no data are available about the possible impact of inter-institute variability in contouring the rectum, so that the possibility of reliably using information from single-centre studies remains doubtful. PURPOSE: Within a retrospective three-institutes study on correlation between dose-volume treatment planning data and rectum bleeding in patients treated for prostate cancer, an investigation about the impact of inter- and intra-observer variability in contouring the rectum was performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients were considered for a dummy run exercise and three observers (one per Institute) contoured the rectum (including filling). An anatomically based definition of rectum extension was previously accepted by the three observers. Six of the ten patients were randomly chosen in the subgroup of patients (large spacing, LS) with a distance between computed tomography (CT) slices (outside the prostate region) equal to 10 mm; for the remaining four patients the distance between CT slices was 5 mm over the whole rectum volume (small spacing, SS). The original 3D treatment planning was recovered on the Cadplan treatment planning system for each patient and rectum dose statistics (mean, median and maximum rectum dose), volume, DVH and NTCP values were calculated for each observer. For DVH analysis, the values of V(50), V(55), V(60), V(65) and V(70) (defined as the \% of rectum volume receiving at least 50, 55, 60, 65, 70 Gy) were considered. Normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs) were calculated for the original ICRU dose and for a 75.6 Gy ICRU dose (NTCP and NTCP(75.6), respectively). Intra-observer variability was investigated by asking the observers to redraw the same rectum contours 6 months later and comparing the two contouring sessions. RESULTS: In general, a good agreement was found for most patients and, in particular, for all SS patients. The impact of inter-observer variability was quite significant on dose statistics and DVH in two of six LS patients. Looking at the patient population, some systematic deviations, even if quite small, were demonstrated between institute B and institute C (volume, P = 0.02) and between institute A and institute B (mean/median dose, V(50)-V(65), NTCP(75.6); P < 0.05). Four of six LS patients (0/4 in the SS group) presented a maximum difference among observers at the cranial and/or caudal limit of the rectum equal to 1 cm. For these patients, inter-observer variability was significantly higher than for the others (P < 0.03). When inter-observer variability was expressed in terms of standard deviations (SD), values around 2-3 Gy and 0.5 Gy for LS and SS patients, respectively, were found for mean/median dose; values around 3-4\% and 0.5-2\% for LS and SS patients, respectively, were found for V(50)-V(70). The average SD for NTCP and NTCP(75.6) were 0.4 and 0.6\%, respectively (0.5 and 0.9\% for LS patients; 0.2 and 0.3\% for SS patients). Intra-observer variability was found to be lower than inter-observer variability even if the impact on dose statistics and DVH was visible. CONCLUSIONS: Once a robust definition of rectum is assessed, inter- and intra-institute variability in contouring the rectum appear relatively modest. However, the results suggest that the number of LS patients in DVH correlation studies should be as low as possible; the low number of these patients in the multi-centric trial involving our institutions should not have significant impact on the results of the study",

abstract="PURPOSE: To assess the predictors of late rectal toxicity in a prospectively investigated group of patients treated at 70-80 Gy for prostate cancer (1.8-2 Gy fractions) with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 1,132 patients were entered into the study between 2002 and 2004. Three types of rectal toxicity, evaluated by a self-administered questionnaire, mainly based on the subjective objective management, analytic late effects of normal tissue system, were considered: stool frequency/tenesmus/pain, fecal incontinence, and bleeding. The data from 506 patients with a follow-up of 24 months were analyzed. The correlation between a number of clinical and dosimetric parameters and Grade 2 or greater toxicity was investigated by univariate and multivariate (MVA) logistic analyses. RESULTS: Of the 1,132 patients, 21, 15, and 30 developed stool frequency/tenesmus/pain, fecal incontinence, and bleeding, respectively. Stool frequency/tenesmus/pain correlated with previous abdominal/pelvic surgery (MVA, p=0.05, odds ratio [OR], 3.3). With regard to incontinence, MVA showed the volume receiving>or=40 Gy (V40) (p=0.035, OR, 1.037) and surgery (p=0.02, OR, 4.4) to be the strongest predictors. V40 to V70 were highly predictive of bleeding; V70 showed the strongest impact on MVA (p=0.03), together with surgery (p=0.06, OR, 2.5), which was also the main predictor of Grade 3 bleeding (p=0.02, OR, 4.2). CONCLUSIONS: The predictive value of the dose-volume histogram was confirmed for bleeding, consistent with previously suggested constraints (V50<55\%, V60<40\%, V70<25\%, and V75<5\%). A dose-volume histogram constraint for incontinence can be suggested (V40<65-70\%). Previous abdominal/pelvic surgery correlated with all toxicity types; thus, a modified constraint for bleeding (V70<15\%) can be suggested for patients with a history of abdominal/pelvis surgery, although further validation on a larger population with longer follow-up is needed",

abstract="Respiration can cause tumors in the thorax or abdomen to move by as much as 3 cm; this movement can adversely affect the planning and delivery of radiation treatment. Several techniques have been used to compensate for respiratory motion, but all have shortcomings. Manufacturers of computed tomography (CT) equipment have recently used a technique developed for cardiac CT imaging to track respiratory-induced anatomical motion and to sort images according to the phase of the respiratory cycle they represent. Here we propose a method of generating CT images that accounts for respiratory-induced anatomical motion on the basis of displacement, i.e., displacement-binned CT image sets. This technique has shown great promise, however, it is not fully supported by currently used CT image reconstruction software. As an interim solution, we have developed a method for extracting displacement-binned CT image data sets from data sets assembled on the basis of a prospectively determined breathing phase acquired on a multislice helical CT scanner. First, the projection data set acquired from the CT scanner was binned at small phase intervals before reconstruction. The manufacturer's software then generated image sets identified as belonging to particular phases of the respiratory cycle. All images were then individually correlated to the displacement of an external fiducial marker. Next, CT image data sets were resorted on the basis of the displacement and assigned an appropriate phase. Finally, displacement-binned image data sets were transferred to a treatment-planning system for analysis. Although the technique is currently limited by the phase intervals allowed by the CT software, some improvement in image reconstruction was seen, indicating that this technique is useful at least as an interim measure",

In this work the abilities of intensity-modulated x-ray therapy (IMXT) and intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) to deliver boosts to multiple subvolumes of varying size and proximities are compared in a thorough phantom study. IMXT plans were created using the step-and-shoot (IMXT-SAS) and helical tomotherapy (IMXT-HT) methods. IMPT plans were created with the spot scanning (IMPT-SS) and distal gradient tracking (IMPT-DGT) methods. IMPT-DGT is a generalization of the distal edge tracking method designed to reduce the number of proton beam spots required to deliver non-uniform dose distributions relative to IMPT-SS. The IMPT methods were delivered over both 180 degrees and 360 degrees arcs. The IMXT-SAS and IMPT-SS methods optimally satisfied the non-uniform dose prescriptions the least and the most, respectively. The IMPT delivery methods reduced the normal tissue integral dose by a factor of about 2 relative to the IMXT delivery methods, regardless of the delivery arc. The IMPT-DGT method reduced the number of proton beam spots by a factor of about 3 relative to the IMPT-SS method",

abstract="The Radiological Physics Center (RPC) developed two heterogeneous anthropomorphic quality assurance phantoms for use in verifying the accuracy of radiation delivery: one for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to the pelvis and the other for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the thorax. The purpose of this study was to describe the design and development of these two phantoms and to demonstrate the reproducibility of measurements generated with them. The phantoms were built to simulate actual patient anatomy. They are lightweight and water-fillable, and they contain imageable targets and organs at risk of radiation exposure that are of similar densities to their human counterparts. Dosimetry inserts accommodate radiochromic film for relative dosimetry and thermoluminesent dosimetry capsules for absolute dosimetry. As a part of the commissioning process, each phantom was imaged, treatment plans were developed, and radiation was delivered at least three times. Under these controlled irradiation conditions, the reproducibility of dose delivery to the target TLD in the pelvis and thorax phantoms was 3\% and 0.5\%, respectively. The reproducibility of radiation-field localization was less than 2.5 mm for both phantoms. Using these anthropomorphic phantoms, pelvic IMRT and thoracic SBRT radiation treatments can be verified with a high level of precision. These phantoms can be used to effectively credential institutions for participation in specific NCI-sponsored clinical trials",

abstract="Background and purpose: To apply target probabilistic planning (TPP) approach to intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plans for head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. Material and methods: Twenty plans of HNC patients were re-planned replacing the simultaneous integrated boost IMRT optimization objectives for minimum dose on the boost target and the elective volumes with research probabilistic objectives: the latter allow for explicit handling of systematic and random geometric uncertainties, enabling confidence level based probabilistic treatment planning. Monte-Carlo evaluations of geometrical errors were performed, with endpoints D98\%, D2\% and Dmean, calculated at a confidence level of 90\%. The dose distribution was expanded outside the patient to prevent large bilateral elective treatment volumes ending up in air for probabilistic shifts. Results: TPP resulted in more regular isodoses and in reduced dose, on average, to organs at risk (OAR), up to more than 6 Gy, while maintaining target coverage and keeping the maximum dose to limiting structures within requirements. In particular, when the surrounding OARs overlap with the planning target volume (PTV) but not with the clinical target volume (CTV), better results were achieved. Conclusion: The TPP approach was evaluated in HNC patients, and proven to be an efficient tool for managing uncertainties.",

abstract="We investigate the potential of megavoltage (MV) cone-beam CT with an amorphous silicon electronic portal imaging device (EPID) as a tool for patient position verification and tumor/organ motion studies in radiation treatment of lung tumors. We acquire 25 to 200 projection images using a 22 x 29 cm EPID. The acquisition is automatic and requires 7 minutes for 100 projections; it can be synchronized with respiratory gating. From these images, volumetric reconstruction is accomplished with a filtered backprojection in the cone-beam geometry. Several important prereconstruction image corrections, such as detector sag, must be applied. Tests with a contrast phantom indicate that differences in electron density of 2\% can be detected with 100 projections, 200 cGy total dose. The contrast-to-noise ratio improves as the number of projections is increased. With 50 projections (100 cGy), high contrast objects are visible, and as few as 25 projections yield images with discernible features. We identify a technique of acquiring projection images with conformal beam apertures, shaped by a multileaf collimator, to reduce the dose to surrounding normal tissue. Tests of this technique on an anthropomorphic phantom demonstrate that a gross tumor volume in the lung can be accurately localized in three dimensions with scans using 88 monitor units. As such, conformal megavoltage cone-beam CT can provide three-dimensional imaging of lung tumors and may be used, for example, in verifying respiratory gated treatments",

abstract=": To evaluate the effectiveness of a commercial system1 in reducing respiration-induced treatment uncertainty by gating the radiation delivery. : The gating system considered here measures respiration from the position of a reflective marker on the patient's chest. Respiration-triggered planning CT scans were obtained for 8 patients (4 lung, 4 liver) at the intended phase of respiration (6 at end expiration and 2 at end inspiration). In addition, fluoroscopic movies were recorded simultaneously with the respiratory waveform. During the treatment sessions, gated localization films were used to measure the position of the diaphragm relative to the vertebral bodies, which was compared to the reference digitally reconstructed radiograph derived from the respiration-triggered planning CT. Variability was quantified by the standard deviation about the mean position. We also assessed the interfraction variability of soft tissue structures during gated treatment in 2 patients using an amorphous silicon electronic portal imaging device. : The gated localization films revealed an interfraction patient-averaged diaphragm variability of 2.8 +/- 1.0 mm (error bars indicate standard deviation in the patient population). The fluoroscopic data yielded a patient-averaged intrafraction diaphragm variability of 2.6 +/- 1.7 mm. With no gating, this intrafraction excursion became 6.9 +/- 2.1 mm. In gated localization films, the patient-averaged mean displacement of the diaphragm from the planning position was 0.0 +/- 3.9 mm. However, in 4 of the 8 patients, the mean (over localization films) displacement was >4 mm, indicating a systematic displacement in treatment position from the planned one. The position of soft tissue features observed in portal images during gated treatments over several fractions showed a mean variability between 2.6 and 5.7 mm. The intrafraction variability, however, was between 0.6 and 1.4 mm, indicating that most of the variability was due to patient setup errors rather than to respiratory motion. : The gating system evaluated here reduces the intra- and interfraction variability of anatomy due to respiratory motion. However, systematic displacements were observed in some cases between the location of an anatomic feature at simulation and its location during treatment. Frequent monitoring is advisable with film or portal imaging",

abstract="In this paper, we present and validate a framework, based on deformable image registration, for automatic processing of serial three-dimensional CT images used in image-guided radiation therapy. A major assumption in deformable image registration has been that, if two images are being registered, every point of one image corresponds appropriately to some point in the other. For intra-treatment images of the prostate, however, this assumption is violated by the variable presence of bowel gas. The framework presented here explicitly extends previous deformable image registration algorithms to accommodate such regions in the image for which no correspondence exists. We show how to use our registration technique as a tool for organ segmentation, and present a statistical analysis of this segmentation method, validating it by comparison with multiple human raters. We also show how the deformable registration technique can be used to determine the dosimetric effect of a given plan in the presence of non-rigid tissue motion. In addition to dose accumulation, we describe a method for estimating the biological effects of tissue motion using a linear\&ndash;quadratic model. This work is described in the context of a prostate treatment protocol, but it is of general applicability",

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate the radiation-induced, premature terminal differentiation and collagen production of fibroblasts after heavy ion irradiation. These endpoints are discussed as an underlying cellular mechanism of fibrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Normal human foreskin fibroblasts (AG1522B) were used to determine clonogenic survival, the premature differentiation and synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, e.g. collagen after irradiation with X-rays, 195 and 11.0 MeV u(-1) carbon ions and 9.9 MeV u(-1) nickel ions. Additionally, biopsies from the skin of minipigs were taken. Similar experiments were carried out after irradiation with X-rays and 195 MeV u(-1) carbon ions. Results and conclusions: RBE for clonogenic survival as well as for fibrosis-related parameters for high-energy carbon ions are slightly above unity. Low-energy carbon ions with a higher LET are more efficient than X-rays, whereas the RBE of nickel ions is below unity. The results obtained for the differentiation pattern and protein production of porcine fibroblasts after irradiation with X-rays and high-energy carbon ions are in agreement with those obtained with human fibroblasts. An accumulation of fibrocytes with a concomitant increase in ECM protein production could be seen after in vitro irradiation. There is no indication of a higher RBE for fibrosis-related parameters compared with other endpoints (survival, chromosomal and DNA damage). The dose- and LET-dependence suggest that premature differentiation is a survival strategy after radiation damage",

abstract="PURPOSE: Brenner and Hall's 1999 paper estimating an alpha/beta value of 1.5 Gy for prostate tumors has stimulated much interest in the question of whether this ratio (of intrinsic radiosensitivity to repair capacity) is much lower in prostate tumors than in other types of tumors that proliferate faster. The implications for possibly treating prostatic cancer using fewer and larger fractions are important. In this paper we review updated clinical data and present somewhat different calculations to estimate alpha/beta. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Seventeen clinical papers published from 1995 to 2000 were reviewed to obtain estimates of biochemical control from radiotherapy alone using external beam, I-125 implants, or Pd-103 implants. The focus was on intermediate risk patients. Three methods of estimating alpha/beta were employed. First, a simple two-step graphical comparison of isoeffective doses from external beam and implant modalities was made, to see which value of alpha/beta predicted the observed identity of biologic effect. Second, the same data were subjected to Direct Analysis (maximum likelihood estimation), from which an estimate of alpha/beta and also of the T(12) of repair of sublethal damage in the tumors (both with confidence intervals) were obtained. Third, preliminary clinical data comparing two different sizes of high-dose boost doses were analyzed in which significantly different bNED was observed at 2 years. RESULTS: The second method gave the definitive result of alpha/beta = 1.49 Gy (95\% CI 1.25-1.76) and T(12) = 1.90 h (95\% CI 1.42-2.86 h). The first method gave a range from 1.4 to 1.9 Gy and showed that if mean or median dose were used instead of prescribed dose, the estimate of alpha/beta would be substantially below 1 Gy. The third method, although based on early follow-up, was consistent with low values of alpha/beta in the region of 2 Gy or below. The estimate for T(12) is the first value reported for prostate tumors in situ. CONCLUSIONS: All the estimates point toward low values of alpha/beta, at least as low as the estimates of Brenner and Hall, and possibly lower than the expected values of about 3 Gy for late complications. Hypofractionation trials for intermediate-risk prostatic cancer appear to be indicated",

abstract="PURPOSE: Recent analyses of clinical results have suggested that the fractionation sensitivity of prostate tumors is remarkably high; corresponding point estimates of the alpha/beta ratio for prostate cancer are around 1.5 Gy, much lower than the typical value of 10 Gy for many other tumors. This low alpha/beta value is comparable to, and possibly even lower than, that of the surrounding late-responding normal tissue in rectal mucosa (alpha/beta nominally 3 Gy, but also likely to be in the 4-5 Gy range). This lower alpha/beta ratio for prostate cancer than for the surrounding late-responding normal tissue creates the potential for therapeutic gain. We analyze here possible high-gain/low-risk hypofractionated protocols for prostate cancer to test this suggestion. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using standard linear-quadratic (LQ) modeling, a set of hypofractionated protocols can be designed in which a series of dose steps is given, each step of which keeps the late complications constant in rectal tissues. This is done by adjusting the dose per fraction and total dose to maintain a constant level of late effects. The effect on tumor control is then investigated. The resulting estimates are theoretical, although based on the best current modeling with alpha/beta parameters, which are discussed thoroughly. RESULTS: If the alpha/beta value for prostate is less than that for the surrounding late-responding normal tissue, the clinical gains can be rather large. Appropriately designed schedules using around ten large fractions can result in absolute increases of 15\% to 20\% in biochemical control with no evidence of disease (bNED), with no increase in late sequelae. Early sequelae are predicted to be decreased, provided that overall times are not shortened drastically because of a possible risk of acute or consequential late reactions in the rectum. An overall time not shorter than 5 weeks appears advisable for the hypofractionation schedules considered, pending further clinical trial results. Even if the prostate tumor alpha/beta ratio turns out to be the same (or even slightly larger than) the surrounding late-responding normal tissue, these hypofractionated regimens are estimated to be very unlikely to result in significantly increased late effects. CONCLUSIONS: The hypofractionated regimens that we suggest be tested for prostate-cancer radiotherapy show high potential therapeutic gain as well as economic and logistic advantages. They appear to have little potential risk as long as excessively short overall times (<5 weeks) and very small fraction numbers (<5) are avoided. The values of bNED and rectal complications presented are entirely theoretical, being related by LQ modeling to existing clinical data for approximately intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients as discussed in detail",

abstract="AIM: To answer the questions: Is the alpha/beta ratio (radiosensitivity to size of dose-per-fraction) really low enough to justify using a few large dose fractions instead of the traditional many small doses? Does this parameter vary with prognostic risk factors? METHODS AND MATERIALS: Three large statistical overviews are critiqued, with results for 5,000, 6,000 and 14,000 patients with prostate carcinoma, respectively. RESULTS: These major analyses agree in finding the average alpha/beta ratio to be less than 2 Gy: 1.55, (95\% confidence interval=0.46-4.52), 1.4 (0.9-2.2), and the third analysis 1.7 (1.4-2.2) by the ASTRO and 1.6 (1.2-2.2) by Phoenix criteria. All agree that alpha/beta values do not vary significantly with the low, intermediate, high and ``all-included'' risk factors. CONCLUSION: The high sensitivity to dose-per-fraction is an intrinsic property of prostate carcinomas and this supports the use of hypo-fractionation to increase the therapeutic gain for these tumours with dose-volume modelling to reduce the risk of late complications in rectum and bladder",

abstract="AIMS: beta-radiation is a novel potential energy source for the creation of myocardial lesions. While the feasibility of delivering beta-radiation via a deflectable transvenous catheter has been described, dose effects and the time course of histopathological changes have not been previously assessed. The purpose of this study was to characterize pathological aspects of cardiac lesions induced by beta-radiation in an animal model at various stages of evolution and in response to different dose exposures. METHODS AND RESULTS: Nine dogs and one pig were studied. The cavotricuspid isthmus, antrum of pulmonary veins (PVs), and mitral isthmus were irradiated (25, 50, 75, or 100 Gy) with strontium-yttrium-90, delivered via a deflectable catheter (cavotricuspid isthmus and mitral isthmus) or a double-loop catheter (antrum of PVs). Eighteen lesions were created. Animals were sacrificed at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, or 6 months. Lesions were processed for morphometric histopathological analyses. Over the first month, lesions were characterized by inflammation, haemorrhage, and myocyte necrosis. Thereafter, fibrotic replacement was predominant. Transmurality of lesions was observed in 50\% of cases, with no dose-response effect (P = 0.976). Surface fibrin thrombus was present in 50\% of cases and was essentially limited to lesions assessed within the first month. No neighbouring injury or pulmonary venous stenosis was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Atrial lesions created by beta-radiation are characterized by an inflammatory phase with surface fibrin thrombosis during the first month and replacement fibrosis thereafter. No appreciable dose-response effect was noted within the 25-100 Gy range tested",

abstract="PURPOSE: Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) is sensitive to errors, mainly due to high stopping power dependency and steep beam dose gradients. Conventional margins are often insufficient to ensure robustness of treatment plans. In this article, a method is developed that takes the uncertainties into account during the plan optimization. METHODS: Dose contributions for a number of range and setup errors are calculated and a minimax optimization is performed. The minimax optimization aims at minimizing the penalty of the worst case scenario. Any optimization function from conventional treatment planning can be utilized by the method. By considering only scenarios that are physically realizable, the unnecessary conservativeness of other robust optimization methods is avoided. Minimax optimization is related to stochastic programming by the more general minimax stochastic programming formulation, which enables accounting for uncertainties in the probability distributions of the errors. RESULTS: The minimax optimization method is applied to a lung case, a paraspinal case with titanium implants, and a prostate case. It is compared to conventional methods that use margins, single field uniform dose (SFUD), and material override (MO) to handle the uncertainties. For the lung case, the minimax method and the SFUD with MO method yield robust target coverage. The minimax method yields better sparing of the lung than the other methods. For the paraspinal case, the minimax method yields more robust target coverage and better sparing of the spinal cord than the other methods. For the prostate case, the minimax method and the SFUD method yield robust target coverage and the minimax method yields better sparing of the rectum than the other methods. CONCLUSIONS: Minimax optimization provides robust target coverage without sacrificing the sparing of healthy tissues, even in the presence of low density lung tissue and high density titanium implants. Conventional methods using margins, SFUD, and MO do not utilize the full potential of IMPT and deliver unnecessarily high doses to healthy tissues",

The parameters controlling DNA damage from direct and indirect effects were adapted to agree with yields and pathway contributions derived from gamma ray irradiation experiments. Single and double strand break (DSB) induction was simulated for irradiations by protons, photons and electrons over a wide range of initial energies. The relative biological effectiveness for DSB induction after proton irradiation was found to rise from 1.2 at 5 keV.micron-1 to about 2.5 at 70 keV.micron-1. About half of this growth resulted from an increased production of DSB clusters associated with small (< 10 kbp) fragments",

abstract="An important advantage for the application of carbon ion beams in tumour therapy is their increased relative biological effectiveness (RBE) as compared to conventional photon radiation. Since RBE among other factors depends on the dose level, the precise knowledge of the RBE dependence on the dose is of particular importance for the comparison of different fractionation schemes, involving different doses per fraction. Here we describe some general properties of the RBE vs. dose dependence, which are determined using a simple modelling approach based on the linear-quadratic model as well as a more sophisticated predictive model for the description of RBE. We show that for both approaches the systematic dependence of RBE on the cell or tissue type as characterized by the ?/?-ratio of the photon linear quadratic parameters is expected to be inverted at high doses as compared to low doses. We demonstrate that this inversion is not a model specific feature, but a rather generic feature resulting from the linear-quadratic shape of dose response curves and the correlation between RBE and the photon ?/?-ratio. The results are discussed with respect to other modelling approaches and to their implications for clinical applications of carbon ion beams using hypofractionated treatment schedules.",

abstract="PURPOSE: The efficiency and precision of respiratory gated radiation therapy for tumors is affected by variations in respiration-induced tumor motion. We evaluated the use of individualized and population-based parameters for such treatment. METHODS AND MATERIALS: External respiratory signal records and images of respiration-induced tumor motion were obtained from 42 patients undergoing respiratory gated radiation therapy for liver tumors. Gating window widths were calculated for each patient, with 2, 4, and 10 mm of residual motion, and the mean was defined as the population-based window width. Residual motions based on population-based and predefined window widths were compared. Duty times based on whole treatment sessions, at various window levels, were calculated. The window level giving the longest duty time was defined as the individualized most efficient level (MEL). MELs were also calculated based on the first 10 breathing cycles. The duty times for population-based MELs (defined as mean MELs) and individualized MELs were compared. RESULTS: Tracks of respiration-induced tumor motion ranged from 3 to 50 mm. Half of the patients had larger actual residual motions than the assigned residual motions. Duty times were greater when based on individualized, rather than population-based, window widths. The MELs established during whole treatment sessions for 2 mm and 4 mm of residual motion gave significantly increased duty times, whereas those calculated using the first 10 breathing cycles showed only marginal increases. CONCLUSIONS: Using individualized window widths and levels provided more precise and efficient respiratory gated radiation therapy. However, methods for predicting individualized window levels before treatment remain to be explored",

The standard algorithm for proton dose calculations is the pencil beam algorithm which produces relatively accurate results, but is time consuming. In order to shorten the computational time, we have developed a GPU (graphics processing unit)-based pencil beam algorithm. We have implemented this algorithm and calculated dose distributions in the case of a water phantom. The results were compared to those obtained by a traditional method with respect to the computational time and discrepancy between the two methods. The new algorithm shows 5-20 times faster performance using the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 480 card in comparison with the Intel Core-i7 920 processor. The maximum discrepancy of the dose distribution is within 0.2\%. Our results show that GPUs are effective for proton dose calculations",

abstract="PURPOSE: A project to construct a new treatment facility, as an extension of the existing HIMAC facility, has been initiated for the further development of carbon-ion therapy at NIRS. This new treatment facility is equipped with a 3D irradiation system with pencil-beam scanning. The challenge of this project is to realize treatment of a moving target by scanning irradiation. To achieve fast rescanning within an acceptable irradiation time, the authors developed a fast scanning system. METHODS: In order to verify the validity of the design and to demonstrate the performance of the fast scanning prior to use in the new treatment facility, a new scanning-irradiation system was developed and installed into the existing HIMAC physics-experiment course. The authors made strong efforts to develop (1) the fast scanning magnet and its power supply, (2) the high-speed control system, and (3) the beam monitoring. The performance of the system including 3D dose conformation was tested by using the carbon beam from the HIMAC accelerator. RESULTS: The performance of the fast scanning system was verified by beam tests. Precision of the scanned beam position was less than +/-0.5 mm. By cooperating with the planning software, the authors verified the homogeneity of the delivered field within +/-3\% for the 3D delivery. This system took only 20 s to deliver the physical dose of 1 Gy to a spherical target having a diameter of 60 mm with eight rescans. In this test, the average of the spot-staying time was considerably reduced to 154 micros, while the minimum staying time was 30 micros. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of this study, the authors verified that the new scanning delivery system can produce an accurate 3D dose distribution for the target volume in combination with the planning software",

abstract="PURPOSE: In moving target irradiation with pencil beam scanning, the interplay effect between the target motion and the scanned beam is a problem because this effect causes over or under dosage in the target volume. To overcome this, we have studied rescanning using a gating technique. METHODS: A simulation and experimental study was carried out. In the experiment, we used the fast scanning system developed at the HIMAC to verify the validity of phase controlled rescanning method, in which the time for rescanning irradiation of each slice is matched to the gating duration. RESULTS: Simulation and experimental results showed that controlling the scan speed to match the respiration cycle with rescans can deliver the blurred dose distribution. In the comparison between the static measurements and the moving measurements with the phase controlled rescanning method, the dose difference was less than 2\% for pinpoint chambers in the target volume. CONCLUSIONS: The simulation and experimental results demonstrated that the phase controlled rescanning method makes it possible to deliver the dose distribution close to the expected one. As an experimental result for 3D irradiation, it was estimated that blurring by the probability density function was not only for a lateral distribution, but also for a distal distribution, even in the lateral rescanning",

abstract="Purpose: Following adequate therapy, excellent long-term survival rates can be achieved for patients with optic pathway gliomas. Therefore, avoidance of treatment-related functional long-term sequelae is of utmost importance. Optimized sparing of normal tissue is of primary concern in the development of new treatment modalities. The present study compares proton radiation therapy (PRT) with a three-dimensional (3D)-planned multiport photon and a lateral beam photon technique for localized and extensive optic pathway tumors.Methods and Materials: Between February 1992 and November 1997, seven children with optic pathway gliomas underwent PRT. For this study, we computed proton, 3D photon, and lateral photon plans based on the same CT data sets, and using the same treatment planning software for all plans. Radiation exposure for normal tissue and discrete organs at risk was quantified based on dose-volume histograms.Results: Gross tumor volume (GTV) ranged from 3.9 cm3 to 127.2 cm3. Conformity index (relation of encompassing isodose to GTV volume) was 2.3 for protons, 2.9 for 3D photons, and 7.3 for lateral photons. The relative increase of normal tissue (NT) encompassed at several isodose levels in relation to NT encompassed by the 95\% proton isodose volume was computed. Relative NT volume of proton plan isodoses at the 95\%, 90\%, 80\%, 50\%, and 25\% isodose level increased from 1 to 1.6, 2.8, 6.4, to a maximum of 13.3. Relative volumes for 3D photons were 1.6, 2.4, 3.8, 11.5, and 34.8. Lateral plan relative values were 6, 8.3, 11.5, 19.2, and 26.8. Analysis for small (3) and larger (\&gt; 80 cm3) tumors showed that protons encompassed the smallest volumes of NT at all isodose levels. Comparable conformity and high-dose gradient were achieved for proton and 3D photon plans in small tumors. However, with increasing tumor volume and complexity, differences became larger. At the 50\% isodose level, 3D photons were superior to lateral photons for small tumors; this advantage was equalized for larger tumors. At the lowest isodose level, 3D photons encompassed the highest amount of NT. Analysis of organs at risk showed that PRT reduced doses to the contralateral optic nerve by 47\% and 77\% compared to 3D photons and lateral photons, respectively. Reductions were also seen for the chiasm (11\% and 16\%) and pituitary gland (13\% and 16\%), with differences at clinically relevant tolerance levels. Furthermore, reduced dose exposure of both temporal lobes (sparing 39\% and 54\%) and frontal lobes was achieved with PRT.Conclusion: PRT offered a high degree of conformity to target volumes and steep dose gradients, thus leading to substantial normal tissue sparing in high- and low-dose areas. It is expected that this will result in decreased long-term toxicity in the maturing child. Advantages of proton versus 3D photon plans became increasingly apparent with increasing target size and tumor complexity. Even in small tumors, conformity of 3D photon irradiation came at the expense of a larger amount of NT receiving moderate to low radiation doses. Lateral photons resulted in inferior dose distribution with high radiation exposure of clinically relevant normal tissues",

abstract="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate an automated 4D-CT contouring propagation tool by its impact on the inter- and intra-physician variability in lung tumour delineation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a previous study, six radiation oncologists contoured the gross tumour volume (GTV) and nodes on 10 phases of the 4D-CT dataset of 10 lung cancer patients to examine the intra- and inter-physician variability. In this study, a model-based deformable image registration algorithm was used to propagate the GTV and nodes on each phase of the same 4D-CT datasets. A blind review of the contours was performed by each physician and edited. Inter- and intra-physician variability for both the manual and automated methods was assessed by calculating the centroid motion of the GTV using the Pearson correlation coefficient and the variability in the internal gross tumour volume (IGTV) overlap using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). RESULTS: The time for manual delineation was (42.7+/-18.6)min versus (17.7+/-5.4)min when the propagation tool was used. A significant improvement in the mean Pearson correlation coefficient was also observed. There was a significant decrease in mean DSC in only 1 out of 10 primary IGTVs and 2 out of 10 nodal IGTVs. Intra-physician variability was not significantly impacted (DSC>0.742). CONCLUSIONS: Automated 4D-CT propagation tools can significantly decrease the IGTV delineation time without significantly decreasing the inter- and intra-physician variability",

abstract="In vivo measurements were made of the dose delivered to animal models in an effort to develop a method for treating cardiac arrhythmia using radiation. This treatment would replace RF energy (currently used to create cardiac scar) with ionizing radiation. In the current study, the pulmonary vein ostia of animal models were irradiated with 6 MV X-rays in order to produce a scar that would block aberrant signals characteristic of atrial fibrillation. The CyberKnife radiosurgery system was used to deliver planned treatments of 20-35 Gy in a single fraction to four animals. The Synchrony system was used to track respiratory motion of the heart, while the contractile motion of the heart was untracked. The dose was measured on the epicardial surface near the right pulmonary vein and on the esophagus using surgically implanted TLD dosimeters, or in the coronary sinus using a MOSFET dosimeter placed using a catheter. The doses measured on the epicardium with TLDs averaged 5\% less than predicted for those locations, while doses measured in the coronary sinus with the MOSFET sensor nearest the target averaged 6\% less than the predicted dose. The measurements on the esophagus averaged 25\% less than predicted. These results provide an indication of the accuracy with which the treatment planning methods accounted for the motion of the target, with its respiratory and cardiac components. This is the first report on the accuracy of CyberKnife dose delivery to cardiac targets",

abstract="The use of radiotherapy in the treatment of bronchial carcinoma evokes changes of the healthy lung parenchyma which may lead to pneumonitis and fibrosis. At present more than 20 tumour chemotherapeutics with lung-toxical effect are known, which may induce a pneumonitis or a fibrosis. When two or more lung-toxically acting cytostatic drugs are combined, we have to take into consideration interactions with synergistic character on the healthy lung parenchyma. The combination of a lung-toxical cytostatic drug with the radiotherapy or the combination of a polychemotherapy with the radiation may cause pneumonitides and fibrosis with increased mortality rate. In our therapy programmes for the treatment of the small cell bronchial carcinoma the polychemotherapy of the tumours (I. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, nitrosomethylurea, II. doxorubicin (adriamycin), dacarbacin, vincristine, III. cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, methotrexate) and the radiotherapy were simultaneously used. Hereby a pneumonitis was x-ray-diagnostically ascertained in more than 70\% and a fibrosis in 30-80\% of the patients treated. In our opinion these high rates of changes of the lung parenchyma have their cause in a complex process: interaction of the tumour chemotherapeutic drugs among one another; interaction of the tumour polychemotherapy with the radiotherapy (particularly in simultaneous application); the bronchial carcinoma is, depending upon anatomical localisation of the tumour and size a risk factor for an infection; the immunosuppressive situation of the patient increases the danger of an infection particularly in the area of the respiratory tract during the therapy. The course of a pneumonitis is decisively determined by a secondary infection",

abstract="Water-to-air stopping power ratio calculations for the ionization chamber dosimetry of clinical carbon ion beams with initial energies from 50 to 450 MeV/u have been performed using the Monte Carlo technique. To simulate the transport of a particle in water the computer code SHIELD-HIT v2 was used, which is a newly developed version where substantial modifications were implemented on its predecessor SHIELD-HIT v1 (Gudowska et al 2004 Phys. Med. Biol. 49 1933-58). The code was completely rewritten replacing formerly used single precision variables with double precision variables. The lowest particle transport specific energy was decreased from 1 MeV/u down to 10 keV/u by modifying the Bethe-Bloch formula, thus widening its range for medical dosimetry applications. In addition, the code includes optionally MSTAR and ICRU-73 stopping power data. The fragmentation model was verified and its parameters were also adjusted. The present code version shows excellent agreement with experimental data. It has been used to compute the physical quantities needed for the calculation of stopping power ratios, s(water,air), of carbon beams. Compared with the recommended constant value given in the IAEA Code of Practice, the differences found in the present investigations varied between 0.5\% and 1\% at the plateau region, respectively for 400 MeV/u and 50 MeV/u beams, and up to 2.3\% in the vicinity of the Bragg peak for 50 MeV/u",

abstract="We present an algorithm suitable for the calculation of the RBE-weighted dose for moving targets with a scanned particle beam. For verification of the algorithm, we conducted a series of cell survival measurements that were compared to the calculations. Calculation of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) with respect to tumor motion was included in the treatment planning procedure, in order to fully assess its impact on treatment delivery with a scanned ion beam. We implemented an algorithm into our treatment planning software TRiP4D which allows determination of the RBE including its dependence on target tissue, absorbed dose, energy and particle spectra in the presence of organ motion. The calculations are based on time resolved computed tomography (4D-CT) and the corresponding deformation maps. The principal of the algorithm is illustrated in in silico simulations that provide a detailed view of the different compositions of the energy and particle spectra at different target positions and their consequence on the resulting RBE. The calculations were experimentally verified with several cell survival measurements using a dynamic phantom and a scanned carbon ion beam. The basic functionality of the new dose calculation algorithm has been successfully tested in in silico simulations. The algorithm has been verified by comparing its predictions to cell survival measurements. Four experiments showed in total a mean difference (standard deviation) of ?^'1.7\% (6.3\%) relative to the target dose of 9 Gy (RBE). The treatment planning software TRiP is now capable to calculate the patient relevant RBE-weighted dose in the presence of target motion and was verified against cell survival measurements",

abstract="We describe a method to irradiate arbitrarily shaped target volumes with simultaneously optimized multiple fields of fast carbon ions, explicitly taking into account sparing of organs at risk. The method was developed with realistic technical boundary conditions in mind, so that irradiations can be executed with devices like the GSI raster scanner or its successors at the upcoming dedicated ion-beam radiotherapy facilities. By virtue of the local effect model (LEM) biological effects are fully taken into account. Several minimization algorithms were investigated, and plain gradient search was found to be more effective than methods based on conjugate gradients or Newton's root finding algorithm. Two sets of cell survival experiments for the experimental verification of patient-like treatment plans were performed. Chinese hamster cells were used for quasi two-dimensional biological dosimetry. The plans combine a very good target conformation with an excellent sparing of organs-at-risk which was verified by the measurements. The results are compared to predictions of the local effect model in its original formulation and a modified version taking additional effects of clustered DNA damage into account. The new method is implemented in GSI's TRiP98 treatment planning system. It has already been applied clinically for planning and irradiating selected patients within the GSI pilot project",

The phantom consists of two 96-microwell plates holding Chinese hamster ovary cells inside a container filled with culture medium and is placed on a movable stage. Basic biological properties of the phantom were investigated without irradiation and after irradiation with a carbon ion beam, using both a stationary (reference) exposure and exposure during motion of the phantom perpendicular to the beam with beam tracking. There was no statistically significant difference between plating efficiency measured in the microwells with and without motion (0.75) and values reported in the literature. Mean differences between measured and calculated cell survival for these two irradiation modes were within +/-5\% of the target dose of 6 Gy (RBE)",

abstract="PURPOSE: To assess the dosimetric differences among volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), scanned proton therapy (intensity-modulated proton therapy, IMPT), scanned carbon-ion therapy (intensity-modulated carbon-ion therapy, IMIT), and low-dose-rate (LDR) and high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy (BT) treatment of localized prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients were considered for this planning study. For external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), planning target volume was created by adding a margin of 5 mm (lateral/anterior-posterior) and 8 mm (superior-inferior) to the clinical target volume. Bladder wall (BW), rectal wall (RW), femoral heads, urethra, and pelvic tissue were considered as organs at risk. For VMAT and IMPT, 78 Gy(relative biological effectiveness, RBE)/2 Gy were prescribed. The IMIT was based on 66 Gy(RBE)/20 fractions. The clinical target volume planning aims for HDR-BT ((192)Ir) and LDR-BT ((125)I) were D(90\%) >/=34 Gy in 8.5 Gy per fraction and D(90\%) >/=145 Gy. Both physical and RBE-weighted dose distributions for protons and carbon-ions were converted to dose distributions based on 2-Gy(IsoE) fractions. From these dose distributions various dose and dose-volume parameters were extracted. RESULTS: Rectal wall exposure 30-70 Gy(IsoE) was reduced for IMIT, LDR-BT, and HDR-BT when compared with VMAT and IMPT. The high-dose region of the BW dose-volume histogram above 50 Gy(IsoE) of IMPT resembled the VMAT shape, whereas all other techniques showed a significantly lower high-dose region. For all 3 EBRT techniques similar urethra D(mean) around 74 Gy(IsoE) were obtained. The LDR-BT results were approximately 30 Gy(IsoE) higher, HDR-BT 10 Gy(IsoE) lower. Normal tissue and femoral head sparing was best with BT. CONCLUSION: Despite the different EBRT prescription and fractionation schemes, the high-dose regions of BW and RW expressed in Gy(IsoE) were on the same order of magnitude. Brachytherapy techniques were clearly superior in terms of BW, RW, and normal tissue sparing, with lowest values for HDR-BT",

abstract="Respiratory motion during intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) causes two types of problems. First, the clinical target volume (CTV) to planning target volume (PTV) margin needed to account for respiratory motion means that the lung and heart dose is higher than would occur in the absence of such motion. Second, because respiratory motion is not synchronized with multileaf collimator (MLC) motion, the delivered dose is not the same as the planned dose. The aims of this work were to evaluate these problems to determine (a) the effects of respiratory motion and setup error during breast IMRT treatment planning, (b) the effects of the interplay between respiratory motion and multileaf collimator (MLC) motion during breast IMRT delivery, and (c) the potential benefits of breast IMRT using breath-hold, respiratory gated, and 4D techniques. Seven early stage breast cancer patient data sets were planned for IMRT delivered with a dynamic MLC (DMLC). For each patient case, eight IMRT plans with varying respiratory motion magnitudes and setup errors (and hence CTV to PTV margins) were created. The effects of respiratory motion and setup error on the treatment plan were determined by comparing the eight dose distributions. For each fraction of these plans, the effect of the interplay between respiratory motion and MLC motion during IMRT delivery was simulated by superimposing the respiratory trace on the planned DMLC leaf motion, facilitating comparisons between the planned and expected dose distributions. When considering respiratory motion in the CTV-PTV expansion during breast IMRT planning, our results show that PTV dose heterogeneity increases with respiratory motion. Lung and heart doses also increase with respiratory motion. Due to the interplay between respiratory motion and MLC motion during IMRT delivery, the planned and expected dose distributions differ. This difference increases with respiratory motion. The expected dose varies from fraction to fraction. However, for the seven patients studied and respiratory trace used, for no breathing, shallow breathing, and normal breathing, there were no statistically significant differences between the planned and expected dose distributions. Thus, for breast IMRT, intrafraction motion degrades treatment plans predominantly by the necessary addition of a larger CTV to PTV margin than would be required in the absence of such motion. This motion can be limited by breath-hold, respiratory gated, or 4D techniques",

abstract="PURPOSE: Respiratory gating is a commercially available technology for reducing the deleterious effects of motion during imaging and treatment. The efficacy of gating is dependent on the reproducibility within and between respiratory cycles during imaging and treatment. The aim of this study was to determine whether audio-visual biofeedback can improve respiratory reproducibility by decreasing residual motion and therefore increasing the accuracy of gated radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 331 respiratory traces were collected from 24 lung cancer patients. The protocol consisted of five breathing training sessions spaced about a week apart. Within each session the patients initially breathed without any instruction (free breathing), with audio instructions and with audio-visual biofeedback. Residual motion was quantified by the standard deviation of the respiratory signal within the gating window. RESULTS: Audio-visual biofeedback significantly reduced residual motion compared with free breathing and audio instruction. Displacement-based gating has lower residual motion than phase-based gating. Little reduction in residual motion was found for duty cycles less than 30\%; for duty cycles above 50\% there was a sharp increase in residual motion. CONCLUSIONS: The efficiency and reproducibility of gating can be improved by: incorporating audio-visual biofeedback, using a 30-50\% duty cycle, gating during exhalation, and using displacement-based gating",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Cardiac mapping is essential for understanding the mechanisms of arrhythmias and for directing curative procedures. A major limitation of the current methods is the inability to accurately relate local electrograms to their spatial orientation. The objective of this study was to present and test the accuracy of a new method for nonfluoroscopic, catheter-based, endocardial mapping. METHODS AND RESULTS: The method is based on using a new locatable catheter connected to an endocardial mapping and navigating system. The system uses magnetic technology to accurately determine the location and orientation of the catheter and simultaneously records the local electrogram from its tip. By sampling a plurality of endocardial sites, the system reconstructs the three-dimensional geometry of the chamber, with the electrophysiological information color-coded and superimposed on the anatomy. The accuracy of the system was tested in both in vitro and in vivo studies and was found to be highly reproducible (SD, 0.16 +/- 0.02 [mean +/- SEM] and 0.74 +/- 0.13 mm) and accurate (mean errors, 0.42 +/- 0.05 and 0.73 +/- 0.03 mm). In further studies, electroanatomical mapping of the cardiac chambers was performed in 34 pigs. Both the geometry and activation sequence were repeatable in all pigs. CONCLUSIONS: The new mapping method is highly accurate and reproducible. The ability to combine electrophysiological and spatial information provides a unique tool for both research and clinical electrophysiology. Consequently, the main shortcomings of conventional mapping-namely, prolonged x-ray exposure, low spatial resolution, and the inability to accurately navigate to a predefined site-can all be overcome with this new method",

abstract="PURPOSE: To quantify the theoretical benefit, in terms of improvement in precision and accuracy of treatment delivery and in dose increase, of using online image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) performed with onboard cone-beam computed tomography (CT), in an ideal setting of no intrafraction motion/deformation, in the treatment of prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-two prostate cancer patients treated with conventional radiotherapy underwent multiple serial CT scans (median 18 scans per patient) during their treatment. We assumed that these data sets were equivalent to image sets obtainable by an onboard cone-beam CT. Each patient treatment was simulated with conventional IMRT and online IG-IMRT separately. The conventional IMRT plan was generated on the basis of pretreatment CT, with a clinical target volume to planning target volume (CTV-to-PTV) margin of 1 cm, and the online IG-IMRT plan was created before each treatment fraction on the basis of the CT scan of the day, without CTV-to-PTV margin. The inverse planning process was similar for both conventional IMRT and online IG-IMRT. Treatment dose for each organ of interest was quantified, including patient daily setup error and internal organ motion/deformation. We used generalized equivalent uniform dose (EUD) to compare the two approaches. The generalized EUD (percentage) of each organ of interest was scaled relative to the prescription dose at treatment isocenter for evaluation and comparison. On the basis of bladder wall and rectal wall EUD, a dose-escalation coefficient was calculated, representing the potential increment of the treatment dose achievable with online IG-IMRT as compared with conventional IMRT. RESULTS: With respect to radiosensitive tumor, the average EUD for the target (prostate plus seminal vesicles) was 96.8\% for conventional IMRT and 98.9\% for online IG-IMRT, with standard deviations (SDs) of 5.6\% and 0.7\%, respectively (p < 0.0001). The average EUDs of bladder wall and rectal wall for conventional IMRT vs. online IG-IMRT were 70.1\% vs. 47.3\%, and 79.4\% vs. 72.2\%, respectively. On average, a target dose increase of 13\% (SD = 9.7\%) can be achieved with online IG-IMRT based on rectal wall EUDs and 53.3\% (SD = 15.3\%) based on bladder wall EUDs. However, the variation (SD = 9.7\%) is fairly large among patients; 27\% of patients had only minimal benefit (<5\% of dose increment) from online IG-IMRT, and 32\% had significant benefit (>15\%-41\% of dose increment). CONCLUSIONS: The ideal maximum dose increment achievable with online IG-IMRT is, on average, 13\% with respect to the dose-limiting organ of rectum. However, there is a large interpatient variation, ranging <5\%-41\%. The results can be applied to calibrate other practical online image-guided techniques for prostate cancer radiotherapy, when intratreatment organ motion/deformation and machine delivery accuracy are considered",

abstract="Purpose: To quantify prostate motion during a radiation therapy treatment using cine-magnetic resonance imaging (cine-MRI) for time frames comparable to that expected in an image-guided radiation therapy treatment session (20-30 min). Materials and Methods: Six patients undergoing radiation therapy for prostate cancer were imaged on 3 days, over the course of therapy (Weeks 1, 3, and 5). Four hundred images were acquired during the 1-h MRI session in 3 sagittal planes through the prostate at 6-s intervals. Eleven anatomic points of interest (POIs) have been used to characterize prostate/bony pelvis/abdominal wall displacement. Motion traces and standard deviation for each of the 11 POIs have been determined. The probability of displacement over time has also been calculated. Results: Patients were divided into 2 groups according to rectal filling status: full vs. empty rectum. The displacement of POIs (standard deviation) ranged from 0.98 to 1.72 mm for the full-rectum group and from 0.68 to 1.04 mm for the empty-rectum group. The low standard deviations in position (2 mm or less) would suggest that these excursions have a low frequency of occurrence. The most sensitive prostate POI to rectal wall motion was the midposterior with a standard deviation of 1.72 mm in the full-rectum group vs. 0.79 mm in the empty-rectum group (p = 0.0001). This POI has a 10\% probability of moving more than 3 mm in a time frame of {\textasciitilde}1 min if the rectum is full vs. {\textasciitilde}20 min if the rectum is empty. Conclusion: Motion of the prostate and seminal vesicles during a time frame similar to a standard treatment session is reduced compared to that reported in interfraction studies. The most significant predictor for intrafraction prostate motion is the status of rectal filling. A prostate displacement of <3 mm (90\%) can be expected for the 20 min after the moment of initial imaging for patients with an empty rectum. This is not the case for patients presenting with full rectum. The determination of appropriate intrafraction margins in radiation therapy to accommodate the time-dependent uncertainty in positional targeting is a topic of ongoing investigations for the on-line image guidance model",

abstract="Adaptive radiotherapy has been introduced to manage an individual's treatment by, including patient-specific treatment variation identified and quantified during the course of radiotherapy in the treatment planning and delivering optimization. Early studies have demonstrated that this technique could significantly improve the therapeutic ratio by safely reducing the large target margin that has to be used in conventional radiotherapy for prostate cancer treatment. Clinical application of off-line image-guided adaptive radiotherapy for prostate cancer has demonstrated encouraging clinical outcome. Long-term clinical follow-up has shown significant improvement in terms of tumor control and low toxicity profile, emphasizing the beneficial effect of image-guidance and adaptive treatment. Continuous development in adaptive radiotherapy has made possible additional increases in target dose by further reducing target margin when using online image-guided adaptive intensity-modulated radiation therapy. However, clinical implementation of new techniques should be explored cautiously and should include a comprehensive management strategy to address uncertainties in target definition and delineation in the preclinical implementation studies",

abstract="Implanted gold fiducial markers are widely used in radiation therapy to improve targeting accuracy. Recent investigations have revealed that metallic fiducial markers can cause severe perturbations in dose distributions for proton therapy, suggesting smaller markers should be considered. The objective of this study was to estimate the dosimetric impact of small gold markers in patients receiving proton therapy for prostate cancer. Small, medium, and large helical wire markers with lengths of 10 mm and helix diameters of 0.35 mm, 0.75 mm, and 1.15 mm, respectively, were implanted in an anthropomorphic phantom. Radiographic visibility was confirmed using a kilovoltage x-ray imaging system, and dose perturbations were predicted from Monte Carlo simulations and confirmed by measurements. Monte Carlo simulations indicated that size of dose perturbation depended on marker size, orientation, and distance from the beam's end of range. Specifically, the perturbation of proton dose for the lateral-opposed-pair treatment technique was 31\% for large markers and 23\% for medium markers in a typical oblique orientation. Results for perpendicular and parallel orientations were respectively lower and higher. Consequently, these markers are not well suited for use in patients receiving proton therapy for prostate cancer. Dose perturbation was not observed for the small markers, but these markers were deemed too fragile for transrectal implantation in the prostate",

The motion of tumors in the abdomen was studied using quantitative fluoroscopic analysis, and the effect on dose delivery to the target was studied.Methods and materialsFluoroscopy sessions for 7 patients with pancreas or liver tumors and fiducial clips were recorded, converted to digital format, and analyzed to quantify the characteristics of tumor motion. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans were generated for 3 patients (a total of five plans), and the dose-volume histograms for the target volume were compared between plans with and without tumor motion.ResultsThe average magnitude of the peak-to-peak motion for the 7 patients in the craniocaudal and AP directions was 7.4 mm and 3.8 mm, respectively. The clip motion varied widely, because the maximal clip excursions were about 47\% greater than the average clip excursions for each patient. The inclusion of tumor motion did not lead to a significant degradation in the target dose-volume histogram for four of five treatment plans studied.ConclusionThe amount of tumor motion for most patients in this study was not large but could, in some instances, significantly degrade the planned target dose-volume histogram. For some patients, therefore, motion mitigation or intervention during treatment may be necessary",

abstract="The correlation of the respiratory motion of external patient markers and abdominal tumors was examined. Data of this type are important for image-guided therapy techniques, such as respiratory gating, that monitor the movement of external fiducials.Methods and Materials: Fluoroscopy sessions for 4 patients with internal, radiopaque tumor fiducial clips were analyzed by computer vision techniques. The motion of the internal clips and the external markers placed on the patient?s abdominal skin surface were quantified and correlated.Results: In general, the motion of the tumor and external markers were well correlated. The maximum amount of peak-to-peak craniocaudal tumor motion was 2.5 cm. The ratio of tumor motion to external-marker motion ranged from 0.85 to 7.1. The variation in tumor position for a given external-marker position ranged from 2 to 9 mm. The period of the breathing cycle ranged from 2.7 to 4.5 seconds, and the frequency patterns for both the tumor and the external markers were similar.Conclusions: Although tumor motion generally correlated well with external fiducial marker motion, relatively large underlying tumor motion can occur compared with external-marker motion and variations in the tumor position for a given marker position. Treatment margins should be determined on the basis of a detailed understanding of tumor motion, as opposed to relying only on external-marker information",

abstract="PURPOSE: External beam accelerated partial breast irradiation requires accurate localization of the target volume for each treatment fraction. Using the concept of target registration error (TRE), the performance of several methods of target localization was compared. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve patients who underwent external beam accelerated partial breast irradiation were included in this study. TRE was quantified for four methods of image guidance: standard laser-based setup, kilovoltage imaging of the chest wall, kilovoltage imaging of surgically implanted clips, and three-dimensional surface imaging of the breast. The use of a reference surface created from a free-breathing computed tomography scan and a reference surface directly captured with three-dimensional video imaging were compared. The effects of respiratory motion were also considered, and gating was used for 8 of 12 patients. RESULTS: The median value of the TRE for the laser, chest wall, and clip alignment was 7.1 mm (n=94), 5.4 mm (n=81), and 2.4 mm (n=93), respectively. The median TRE for gated surface imaging based on the first fraction reference surface was 3.2 mm (n=49), and the TRE for gated surface imaging using the computed tomography-based reference surface was 4.9 mm (n=56). The TRE for nongated surface imaging using the first fraction reference surface was 6.2 mm (n=25). CONCLUSIONS: The TRE of surface imaging using a reference surface directly captured with three-dimensional video and the TRE for clip-based setup were within 1 mm. Gated capture is important for surface imaging to reduce the effects of respiratory motion in accelerated partial breast irradiation",

abstract="CONTEXT: Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia in elderly persons and a potent risk factor for stroke. However, recent prevalence and projected future numbers of persons with atrial fibrillation are not well described. OBJECTIVE: To estimate prevalence of atrial fibrillation and US national projections of the numbers of persons with atrial fibrillation through the year 2050. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Cross-sectional study of adults aged 20 years or older who were enrolled in a large health maintenance organization in California and who had atrial fibrillation diagnosed between July 1, 1996, and December 31, 1997. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of atrial fibrillation in the study population of 1.89 million; projected number of persons in the United States with atrial fibrillation between 1995-2050. RESULTS: A total of 17 974 adults with diagnosed atrial fibrillation were identified during the study period; 45\% were aged 75 years or older. The prevalence of atrial fibrillation was 0.95\% (95\% confidence interval, 0.94\%-0.96\%). Atrial fibrillation was more common in men than in women (1.1\% vs 0.8\%; P<.001). Prevalence increased from 0.1\% among adults younger than 55 years to 9.0\% in persons aged 80 years or older. Among persons aged 50 years or older, prevalence of atrial fibrillation was higher in whites than in blacks (2.2\% vs 1.5\%; P<.001). We estimate approximately 2.3 million US adults currently have atrial fibrillation. We project that this will increase to more than 5.6 million (lower bound, 5.0; upper bound, 6.3) by the year 2050, with more than 50\% of affected individuals aged 80 years or older. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that atrial fibrillation is common among older adults and provides a contemporary basis for estimates of prevalence in the United States. The number of patients with atrial fibrillation is likely to increase 2.5-fold during the next 50 years, reflecting the growing proportion of elderly individuals. Coordinated efforts are needed to face the increasing challenge of optimal stroke prevention and rhythm management in patients with atrial fibrillation",

abstract="Available deformable registration methods are often inaccurate over large organ variation encountered, for example, in the rectum and bladder. The authors developed a novel approach to accurately and effectively register large deformations in the prostate region for adaptive radiation therapy. A software tool combining a fast symmetric demons algorithm and the use of masks was developed in C++ based on ITK libraries to register CT images acquired at planning and before treatment fractions. The deformation field determined was subsequently used to deform the delivered dose to match the anatomy of the planning CT. The large deformations involved required that the bladder and rectum volume be masked with uniform intensities of -1000 and 1000 HU, respectively, in both the planning and treatment CTs. The tool was tested for five prostate IGRT patients. The average rectum planning to treatment contour overlap improved from 67\% to 93\%, the lowest initial overlap is 43\%. The average bladder overlap improved from 83\% to 98\%, with a lowest initial overlap of 60\%. Registration regions were set to include a volume receiving 4\% of the maximum dose. The average region was 320 x 210 x 63, taking approximately 9 min to register on a dual 2.8 GHz Linux system. The prostate and seminal vesicles were correctly placed even though they are not masked. The accumulated doses for multiple fractions with large deformation were computed and verified. The tool developed can effectively supply the previously delivered dose for adaptive planning to correct for interfractional changes",

abstract="The aim of this phase II study was to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a specific three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy technique with concurrent continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (CI 5FU) sandwiched between gemcitabine chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Patients with inoperable cancer in the pancreatic head or body without metastases were given gemcitabine at 1000 mg m(-2) weekly for 3 weeks followed by a 1-week rest and a 6-week period of radiotherapy and concurrent CI 5FU (200 mg m(-2) day(-1)). The defined target volume was treated to 54 Gy in 30 daily fractions of 1.8 Gy. After 4 weeks' rest, gemcitabine treatment was re-initiated for three cycles (days 1, 8, 15, q28). Forty-one patients were enrolled. At the end of radiotherapy, one patient (2.4\%) had a complete response and four patients (9.6\%) had a partial response; at the end of treatment, three patients (7.3\%) had a complete response and two patients (4.9\%) had a partial response. Median survival time was 11.7 months, median time to progression was 7.1 months, and median time to failure of local control was 11.9 months. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 46.3 and 9.8\%, respectively. Treatment-related grade 3 and 4 toxicities were reported by 16 (39.0\%) and four (9.8\%) patients, respectively. Sixteen out of 41 patients did not complete the planned treatment and nine due to disease progression. This approach to treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer is safe and promising, with good local control for a substantial proportion of patients, and merits testing in a randomised trial",

After analysis of the nuclear charge distributions, the total charge removal cross-sections and elemental production cross-sections of fragments with atomic numbers from 5 to 3, were obtained down to the lower energies (approximately 50 and 100 MeV/u, respectively). It has been found that the measured total charge removal cross-section agrees with theoretical predictions within approximately 10\% and very well with previous experiments in corresponding energy regions. Two model calculations for production of B fragment are in good agreement with our measured data while a third model overestimates it by approximately 12\%.

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate robust margin strategies in intensity modulated proton therapy to account for interfractional organ motion in prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For 9 patients, one planning computed tomography (CT) scan and daily and weekly cone beam CTs (CBCTs) were acquired and coregistered. The following planning target volume (PTV) approaches were investigated: a clinical target volume (CTV) delineated on the planning CT (CTV(ct)) plus 10-mm margin (PTV(10mm)); a reduced PTV (PTV(Red)): CTV(ct) plus 5 mm in the left-right (LR) and anterior-posterior (AP) directions and 8 mm in the inferior-superior (IS) directions; and a PTV(Hull) method: the sum of CTV(ct) and CTVs from 5 CBCTs from the first week plus 3 mm in the LR and IS directions and 5 mm in the AP direction. For each approach, separate plans were calculated using a spot-scanning technique with 2 lateral fields. RESULTS: Each approach achieved excellent target coverage. Differences were observed in volume receiving 98\% of the prescribed dose (V(98\%)) where PTV(Hull) and PTV(Red) results were superior to the PTV(10mm) concept. The PTV(Hull) approach was more robust to organ motion. The V(98\%) for CTVs was 99.7\%, whereas for PTV(Red) and PTV(10mm) plans, V(98\%) was 98\% and 96.1\%, respectively. Doses to organs at risk were higher for PTV(Hull) and PTV(10mm) plans than for PTV(Red), but only differences between PTV(10mm) and PTV(Red) were significant. CONCLUSIONS: In terms of organ sparing, the PTV(10mm) method was inferior but not significantly different from the PTV(Red) and PTV(Hull) approaches. PTV(Hull) was most insensitive to target motion",

abstract="Summary For the scheduled future revision of the TNM staging system for lung cancer, it is important that the present 1997 version be evaluated in a large population. In 2001, the Japanese Joint Committee of Lung Cancer Registry sent a questionnaire to 320 Japanese institutions regarding the prognosis and clinicopathological profiles of patients who underwent the resection for primary lung neoplasms in 1994. We compiled the data for 7408 patients from 303 institutions (94.7\%). Among these, 6644 patients with non-small cell histology were studied in terms of prognosis. The 5-year survival rate of the entire group was 52.6\%. The 5-year survival rates by clinical (c-) stage were as follows: 72.1\% for IA (n = 2423), 49.9\% for IB (n = 1542), 48.7\% for IIA (n = 150), 40.6\% for IIB (n = 746), 35.8\% for IIIA (n = 1270), 28.0\% for IIIB (n = 366) and 20.8\% for IV (n = 147). The difference in prognosis between neighboring stages was significant except for between IB and IIA and between IIIB and IV. The 5-year survival rates by pathological (p-) stage were as follows: 79.5\% for IA (n = 2009), 60.1\% for IB (n = 1418), 59.9\% for IIA (n = 232), 42.2\% for IIB (n = 757), 29.8\% for IIIA (n = 1250), 19.3\% for IIIB (n = 719) and 20.0\% for IV (n = 259). The difference in prognosis between neighboring stages was significant except for between IB and IIA and between IIIB and IV. The survival curves of stages IB and IIA were almost superimposed in both c- and p-settings. These findings indicated that the present stages IB and IIA should be merged into the same stage category. Otherwise, the present TNM staging system seemed to well characterize the stage-specific prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer. The future revision should focus on the subdivision of stages I and II",

abstract="PURPOSE: Particle therapy offers benefits over conventional photon therapy but also introduces sensitivity to changes in the water-equivalent path length (WEPL) in case of target motion, e.g., breathing. Target motion can be addressed by the internal target volume (ITV) approach, defined as the CTV plus target movement. In photon therapy, the ITV can be constructed as the geometric union of CTVs in all motion states (GEO-ITV) of a 4D-CT, but this does not account for WEPL-changes. An ITV including WEPL-changes can be defined as the union of all CTVs transformed to a WEPL-equivalent axis along beam's eye view. The resulting WEPL-ITV is field-specific and thus unsuitable for intensity modulated particle therapy (IMPT). The purpose of this study was an IMPT-compatible ITV by splitting geometrical motion and field-specific WEPL changes, following ICRU 78 recommendations. METHODS: For all fields, the GEO-ITV was used as a common target. This identical geometry for all fields was mapped to an enlarged WEPL extent with a field-specific transformation. As the dose distribution is determined by the WEPL, this is sufficient to achieve equivalent dose coverage as for a geometrically enlarged target volume. The WEPL enlargement is only visible to the specific field and therefore does not increase the target volume of other fields. This avoids unnecessary lateral field extensions, reducing the dose to normal tissue. Homogeneous dose coverage in IMPT is achieved only if the inhomogeneous doses from the individual fields match up during delivery. As the course of the WEPL within each motion phase differs, this cannot be guaranteed by optimizing the fields only in the reference phase. The WEPL-ITV for the reference phase can be amended by CTVs from a subset of motion phases (4D-WEPL-ITV). Here, end-exhale as the reference phase was combined with end-inhale to cover the whole motion range. The GEO-ITV, WEPL-ITV, and 4D-WEPL-ITV were applied in an IMPT simulation of a lung cancer patient case using a four-field geometry and the heart as an OAR. A static plan of the CTV in end-exhale was computed for reference. The CTV was moving approximately 20 mm in SI and was partly overlapping the heart. For a single fraction a target dose of 17.7 GyE was prescribed, with a 50\% maximum dose for the heart. RESULTS: With 21 rescans to counter interplay, the homogeneity (D5-D95) was 17.0\%, 9.0\%, 6.0\%, and 3.5\% for the GEO-ITV, WEPL-ITV, 4D-WEPL-ITV, and a 3D CTV plan computed for reference, respectively. Due to the overlap, the 50\% maximum dose was violated by all plans, with V50 of 3.8\%, 3.5\%, 3.7\%, and 2.0\% for the four plans. CONCLUSIONS: A 4D-WEPL-ITV method was developed that is suitable for IMPT, covers range changes, and drastically improves dose homogeneity in the target without increasing the OAR dose",

abstract="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Scanned carbon beam therapy offers advantageous dose distributions and an increased biological effect. Treating moving targets is complex due to sensitivity to range changes and interplay. We propose a 4D treatment planning concept that considers motion during particle number optimization. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The target was subdivided into sectors, one for each motion phase of a 4D-CT. Each sector was non-rigidly transformed to its motion phase and there targeted by a dedicated raster field (RST). Therefore, the resulting 4D-RST compensated target motion and range changes. A 4D treatment control system (TCS) was needed for synchronized delivery to the measured patient motion. 4D-optimized plans were simulated for 9 NSCLC lung cancer patients and compared to static irradiation at end-exhale. A prototype TCS was implemented and successfully tested in a film experiment. RESULTS: The 4D-optimized treatment plan resulted in only slightly lower dose coverage of the target compared to static optimization, with V95\% of 97.9\% (median, range 96.5-99.4\%) vs. 99.3\% (98.5-99.8\%), with negligible overdose. The conformity number was comparable at 88.2\% (85.1-92.5\%) vs. 85.2\% (79.9-91.2\%) for 4D and static, respectively. CONCLUSION: We implemented and tested a 4D treatment plan optimization method resulting in highly conformal dose delivery",

abstract="The treatment of moving tumors remains challenging, especially with scanned ion beam therapy due to interplay effects and the strong range dependence. This is especially true in the context of radiosurgery with high dose delivered in few or single fractions. Inverse treatment planning on the entire 4D-CT may result in conformal plans inherently adapted to the moving anatomy of the patient. Existing studies on this topic for photon therapy are reviewed, but arguably the benefits for ion beam therapy can be even greater. Compared to the main conformal mitigation technique of beam tracking, 4D-optimization permits a) easier, offline handling of range changes, b) handling of complex motion patterns, and c) improved dose shaping capabilities outside of the target. Different approaches for 4D-optimization in scanned ion beam therapy are proposed and compared, together with delivery methods that provide the necessary synchronization between irradiation and detected patient motion. Potential solutions for the improvement of robustness in 4D-optimization are discussed. A method for delivery of homogenous doses to each motion phase is presented that might be a potential solution for robust conformal dose delivery for future clinical use. In an exemplary lung cancer patient case with a large motion amplitude, 4D-optimization resulted in conformal dose coverage while beam tracking did not. In conclusion, different strategies of 4D-optimization could provide increased OAR sparing and highly conformal dose delivery for targets with complex motion patterns and large amplitudes",

abstract="PURPOSE: To quantify the impact of respiratory motion on the treatment of lung tumors with spot scanning proton therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations were used to assess the interplay effect, which results from relative motion of the tumor and the proton beam, on the dose distribution in the patient. Ten patients with varying tumor sizes (2.6-82.3 cc) and motion amplitudes (3-30 mm) were included in the study. We investigated the impact of the spot size, which varies between proton facilities, and studied single fractions and conventionally fractionated treatments. The following metrics were used in the analysis: minimum/maximum/mean dose, target dose homogeneity, and 2-year local control rate (2y-LC). RESULTS: Respiratory motion reduces the target dose homogeneity, with the largest effects observed for the highest motion amplitudes. Smaller spot sizes (sigma approximately 3 mm) are inherently more sensitive to motion, decreasing target dose homogeneity on average by a factor 2.8 compared with a larger spot size (sigma approximately 13 mm). Using a smaller spot size to treat a tumor with 30-mm motion amplitude reduces the minimum dose to 44.7\% of the prescribed dose, decreasing modeled 2y-LC from 87.0\% to 2.7\%, assuming a single fraction. Conventional fractionation partly mitigates this reduction, yielding a 2y-LC of 71.6\%. For the large spot size, conventional fractionation increases target dose homogeneity and prevents a deterioration of 2y-LC for all patients. No correlation with tumor volume is observed. The effect on the normal lung dose distribution is minimal: observed changes in mean lung dose and lung V20 are <0.6 Gy(RBE) and <1.7\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: For the patients in this study, 2y-LC could be preserved in the presence of interplay using a large spot size and conventional fractionation. For treatments using smaller spot sizes and/or in the delivery of single fractions, interplay effects can lead to significant deterioration of the dose distribution and lower 2y-LC",

abstract="PURPOSE: To report tumor local control after treatment with single-dose image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (SD-IGRT) to extracranial metastatic sites. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 126 metastases in 103 patients were treated with SD-IGRT to prescription doses of 18-24 Gy (median, 24 Gy) between 2004 and 2007. RESULTS: The overall actuarial local relapse-free survival (LRFS) rate was 64\% at a median follow-up of 18 months (range, 2-45 months). The median time to failure was 9.6 months (range, 1-23 months). On univariate analysis, LRFS was significantly correlated with prescription dose (p = 0.029). Stratification by dose into high (23 to 24 Gy), intermediate (21 to 22 Gy), and low (18 to 20 Gy) dose levels revealed highly significant differences in LRFS between high (82\%) and low doses (25\%) (p < 0.0001). Overall, histology had no significant effect on LRFS (p = 0.16). Renal cell histology displayed a profound dose-response effect, with 80\% LRFS at the high dose level (23 to 24 Gy) vs. 37\% with low doses (</=22 Gy) (p = 0.04). However, for patients who received the high dose level, histology was not a statistically significant predictor of LRFS (p = 0.90). Target organ (bone vs. lymph node vs. soft tissues) (p = 0.5) and planning target volume size (p = 0.55) were not found to be associated with long-term LRFS probability. Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed prescription dose to be a significant predictor of LRFS (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: High-dose SD-IGRT is a noninvasive procedure resulting in high probability of local tumor control. Single-dose IGRT may be effectively used to locally control metastatic deposits regardless of histology and target organ, provided sufficiently high doses (> 22 Gy) of radiation are delivered",

abstract="Summary Target volume delineation of lung cancer is well known to be prone to large inter-observer variability. The advent of PET/CT devices, with co-registered functional and anatomical data, has opened new exciting possibilities for target volume definition in radiation oncology. PET/CT imaging is rapidly being embraced by the radiation oncology community as a tool to improve the accuracy of target volume delineation for treatment optimization in NSCLC. Several studies have dealt with the feasibility of incorporating FDG-PET information into contour delineation with the aim to improve overall accuracy and to reduce inter-observer variation. A significant impact of PET-derived contours on treatment planning has been shown in 30-60\% of the plans with respect to the CT-only target volume. The most prominent changes in the gross tumour volume (GTV) have been reported in cases with atelectasis and following the incorporation of PET-positive nodes in otherwise CT-insignificant nodal areas. Although inter-observer variability is still present following target volume delineation with PET/CT, it is greatly reduced compared to conventional CT-only contouring. PET/CT may also provide improved therapeutic ratio compared to conventional CT planning. Increased target coverage and often reduced target volumes may potentially result in PET/CT-based planning to yield better tumour control probability through dose escalation, while still complying with dose/volume constrains for normal tissues. Despite these exciting results, more clinical studies need to be performed to better define the role of combined PET/CT in treatment planning for NSCLC",

abstract="PURPOSE: To determine treatment accuracy and margins for stereotactic lung radiotherapy with and without cone-beam CT (CBCT) image guidance. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Acquired for the study were 308 CBCT of 24 patients with solitary peripheral lung tumors treated with stereotactic radiotherapy. Patients were immobilized in a stereotactic body frame (SBF) or alpha-cradle and treated with image guidance using daily CBCT. Four (T1) or five (T2/metastatic) 12-Gy fractions were prescribed to the planning target volume (PTV) edge. The PTV margin was >or=5 mm depending on a pretreatment estimate of tumor excursion. Initial daily setup was according to SBF coordinates or tattoos for alpha-cradle cases. A CBCT was performed and registered to the planning CT using soft tissue registration of the target. The initial setup error/precorrection position, was recorded for the superior-inferior, anterior-posterior, and medial-lateral directions. The couch was adjusted to correct the tumor positional error. A second CBCT verified tumor position after correction. Patients were treated in the corrected position after the residual errors were <or=2 mm. A final CBCT after treatment assessed intrafraction tumor displacement. RESULTS: The precorrection systematic (Sigma) and random errors (sigma) for the population ranged from 2-3 mm for SBF and 2-6 mm for alpha-cradle patients; postcorrection errors ranged from 0.4-1.0 mm. Calculated population margins were 9 to 13 mm (SBF) and 10-14 mm (cradle) precorrection, 1-2 mm (SBF), and 2-3 mm (cradle) postcorrection, and 2-4 mm (SBF) and 2-5 mm (cradle) posttreatment. CONCLUSIONS: Setup for stereotactic lung radiotherapy using a SBF or alpha-cradle alone is suboptimal. CBCT image guidance significantly improves target positioning and substantially reduces required target margins and normal tissue irradiation",

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of hypoxia positron emission tomography (PET) using [18F]fluoroazomycin-arabinoside (FAZA) in head and neck cancer for radiation treatment planning using intensity-modulated radiotherapy and dose painting. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighteen patients with advanced squamous cell head and neck cancer were included. Both FAZA-PET and axial CT were performed using mask fixation. The data were coregistered using software based on mutual information. Contours of tumor (primary gross tumor volume, GTV/CT-P) and lymph node metastases (GTV/CT-N) were outlined manually, and FAZA standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated automatically. The hypoxic subvolume (GTV/PET-FAZA) having at least 50\% more FAZA uptake than background (mean SUV) neck muscle tissue was contoured automatically within GTV/CT-P (GTV/PET-FAZA-P) and GTV/CT-N (GTV/PET-FAZA-N). RESULTS: The median GTV/PET-FAZA-P was 4.6 mL, representing 10.8\% (range, 0.7-52\%) of the GTV/CT-P. The GTV/PET-FAZA-P failed to correlate significantly with the GTV/CT-P (p = 0.06). The median GTV/PET-FAZA-N was 4.1 mL, representing 8.3\% (range, 2.2-51.3\%) of the GTV/CT-N. It was significantly correlated with the GTV/PET-N (p = 0.006). The GTV/PET-FAZA-P was located in a single confluent area in 11 of 18 patients (61\%) and was diffusely dispersed in the whole GTV/CT-P in 4 of 18 patients (22\%), whereas no hypoxic areas were identified in 3 of 18 patients (17\%). The GTV/PET-FAZA-N was outlined as a single confluent region in 7 of 18 patients (39\%), in multiple diffuse hypoxic regions in 4 of 18 patients (22\%), and was not delineated in 7 of 18 patients (39\%). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that FAZA-PET imaging could be used for a hypoxia-directed intensity-modulated radiotherapy approach in head and neck cancer",

abstract="(18)F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is one of the most sensitive and specific imaging modalities for the diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer. A drawback of PET is that it requires several minutes of acquisition per bed position, which results in images being affected by respiratory blur. Respiratory gating techniques have been developed to deal with respiratory motion in the PET images. However, these techniques considerably increase the level of noise in the reconstructed images unless the acquisition time is increased. The aim of this paper is to evaluate a four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction algorithm that combines the acquired events in all the gates whilst preserving the motion deblurring. This algorithm was compared to classic ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction of gated and non-gated images, and to temporal filtering of gated images reconstructed with OSEM. Two datasets were used for comparing the different reconstruction approaches: one involving the NEMA IEC/2001 body phantom in motion, the other obtained using Monte-Carlo simulations of the NCAT breathing phantom. Results show that 4D reconstruction reaches a similar performance in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as non-gated reconstruction whilst preserving the motion deblurring. In particular, 4D reconstruction improves the SNR compared to respiratory-gated images reconstructed with the OSEM algorithm. Temporal filtering of the OSEM-reconstructed images helps improve the SNR, but does not achieve the same performance as 4D reconstruction. 4D reconstruction of respiratory-gated images thus appears as a promising tool to reach the same performance in terms of the SNR as non-gated acquisitions while reducing the motion blur, without increasing the acquisition time",

abstract="Respiration-induced target motion is a major problem in intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Beam segments are delivered serially to form the total dose distribution. In the presence of motion, the spatial relation between dose deposition from different segments will be lost. Usually, this results in over- and underdosage. Besides such interplay effects between target motion and dynamic beam delivery as known from photon therapy, changes in internal density have an impact on delivered dose for intensity-modulated charged particle therapy. In this study, we have analysed interplay effects between raster scanned carbon ion beams and target motion. Furthermore, the potential of an online motion strategy was assessed in several simulations. An extended version of the clinical treatment planning software was used to calculate dose distributions to moving targets with and without motion compensation. For motion compensation, each individual ion pencil beam tracked the planned target position in the lateral as well as longitudinal direction. Target translations and rotations, including changes in internal density, were simulated. Target motion simulating breathing resulted in severe degradation of delivered dose distributions. For example, for motion amplitudes of +/-15 mm, only 47\% of the target volume received 80\% of the planned dose. Unpredictability of resulting dose distributions was demonstrated by varying motion parameters. On the other hand, motion compensation allowed for dose distributions for moving targets comparable to those for static targets. Even limited compensation precision (standard deviation approximately 2 mm), introduced to simulate possible limitations of real-time target tracking, resulted in less than 3\% loss in dose homogeneity",

abstract="PURPOSE: Different ion types offer different physical and biological advantages for therapeutic applications. The purpose of this work is to assess the advantages of the most commonly used ions in particle therapy, i.e., carbon ((12)C), helium ((4)He), and protons ((1)H) for different treatment scenarios. METHODS: A treatment planning analysis based on idealized target geometries was performed using the treatment planning software TRiP98. For the prediction of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) that is required for biological optimization in treatment planning the local effect model (LEM IV) was used. To compare the three ion types, the peak-to-entrance ratio (PER) was determined for the physical dose (PERPHY S), the RBE (PERRBE), and the RBE-weighted dose (PERBIO) resulting for different dose-levels, field configurations, and tissue types. Further, the dose contribution to artificial organs at risk (OAR) was assessed and a comparison of the dose distribution for the different ion types was performed for a patient with chordoma of the skull base. RESULTS: The study showed that the advantages of the ions depend on the physical and biological properties and the interplay of both. In the case of protons, the consideration of a variable RBE instead of the clinically applied generic RBE of 1.1 indicates an advantage in terms of an increased PERRBE for the analyzed configurations. Due to the fact that protons show a somewhat better PERPHY S compared to helium and carbon ions whereas helium shows a higher PERRBE compared to protons, both protons and helium ions show a similar RBE-weighted dose distribution. Carbon ions show the largest variation of the PERRBE with tissue type and a benefit for radioresistant tumor types due to their higher LET. Furthermore, in the case of a two-field irradiation, an additional gain in terms of PERBIO is observed when using an orthogonal field configuration for carbon ions as compared to opposing fields. In contrast, for protons, the PERBIO is almost independent on the field configuration. Concerning the artificial lateral OAR, the volume receiving 20\% of the prescribed RBE-weighted dose (V20) was reduced by over 35\% using helium ions and by over 40\% using carbon ions compared to protons. The analysis of the patient plan showed that protons, helium, and carbon ions are similar in terms of target coverage whereas the dose to the surrounding tissue is increasing from carbon ions toward protons. The mean dose to the brain stem can be reduced by more than 55\% when using helium ions and by further 25\% when using carbon ions instead of protons. CONCLUSIONS: The comparison of the PERRBE and PERPHY S of the three ion types suggests a strong dependence of the advantages of the three ions on the dose-level, tissue type, and field configuration. In terms of conformity, i.e., dose to the normal tissue, a clear gain is expected using carbon or helium ions compared to protons",

Methods: Eligible studies on conventional radiotherapy (CRT), stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT), concurrent chemoradiation (CCR), proton therapy and carbon-ion therapy were searched through a systematic review. To obtain pooled estimates of 2- and 5-year disease-specific and overall survival and the occurrence of severe adverse events for each treatment modality, a random effects meta-analysis was carried out. Pooled estimates were corrected for effect modifiers. Results: Corrected pooled estimates for 2-year overall survival in stage I inoperable NSCLC ranged from 53\% for CRT to 74\% for carbon-ion therapy. Fiveyear overall survival for CRT (20\%) was statistically significantly lower than that for SBRT (42\%), proton therapy (40\%) and carbon-ion therapy (42\%). However, caution is warranted due to the limited number of patients and limited length of follow-up of the particle studies. Conclusion: Survival rates for particle therapy were higher than those for CRT, but similar to SBRT in stage I inoperable NSCLC. Particle therapy may be more beneficial in stage III NSCLC, especially in reducing adverse events.",

abstract="Online adaptive radiation therapy (ART) is an attractive concept that promises the ability to deliver an optimal treatment in response to the inter-fraction variability in patient anatomy. However, it has yet to be realized due to technical limitations. Fast dose deposit coefficient calculation is a critical component of the online planning process that is required for plan optimization of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Computer graphics processing units (GPUs) are well suited to provide the requisite fast performance for the data-parallel nature of dose calculation. In this work, we develop a dose calculation engine based on a finite-size pencil beam (FSPB) algorithm and a GPU parallel computing framework. The developed framework can accommodate any FSPB model. We test our implementation in the case of a water phantom and the case of a prostate cancer patient with varying beamlet and voxel sizes. All testing scenarios achieved speedup ranging from 200 to 400 times when using a NVIDIA Tesla C1060 card in comparison with a 2.27 GHz Intel Xeon CPU. The computational time for calculating dose deposition coefficients for a nine-field prostate IMRT plan with this new framework is less than 1 s. This indicates that the GPU-based FSPB algorithm is well suited for online re-planning for adaptive radiotherapy",

abstract="Targeting at the development of an accurate and efficient dose calculation engine for online adaptive radiotherapy, we have implemented a finite-size pencil beam (FSPB) algorithm with a 3D-density correction method on graphics processing unit (GPU). This new GPU-based dose engine is built on our previously published ultrafast FSPB computational framework (Gu et al 2009 Phys. Med. Biol. 54 6287-97). Dosimetric evaluations against Monte Carlo dose calculations are conducted on ten IMRT treatment plans (five head-and-neck cases and five lung cases). For all cases, there is improvement with the 3D-density correction over the conventional FSPB algorithm and for most cases the improvement is significant. Regarding the efficiency, because of the appropriate arrangement of memory access and the usage of GPU intrinsic functions, the dose calculation for an IMRT plan can be accomplished well within 1 s (except for one case) with this new GPU-based FSPB algorithm. Compared to the previous GPU-based FSPB algorithm without 3D-density correction, this new algorithm, though slightly sacrificing the computational efficiency ( approximately 5-15\% lower), has significantly improved the dose calculation accuracy, making it more suitable for online IMRT replanning",

NSCLC n = 6; pulmonary metastases n = 19) were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy (1 to 8 fractions). Prior to every fraction a CB-CT was acquired in treatment position, errors between planned and actual tumor position were measured and corrected. Intra- and inter-observer variability of manual evaluation of tumor position error was investigated and this manual method was compared with automatic image registration. Based on CB-CTs from 66 fractions the discrepancy (3-D vector) between planned and actual tumor position was 7.7 mm +/-1.3 mm. Tumor position error relative to the bony anatomy was 5.3 mm +/-1.2 mm, the correlation between bony anatomy and tumor position was poor. Intra-observer and inter-observer variability of manual evaluation of tumor position error was 0.9 mm +/-0.8 mm and 2.3 mm +/-1.1 mm, respectively. Automatic image registration showed highly reproducible results (<1 mm). However, compared with manual registration a systematic error was found in direction of predominant tumor breathing motion (2.5 mm vs 1.4 mm). Image-guidance using CB-CT was validated for high precision radiotherapy of intrapulmonary tumors. It was shown that both the planning reference and the verification image study have to consider tumor breathing motion",

METHODS: The technological basis of IMRT and the rationale for the use in treatment of prostate cancer are described. Clinical results from the literature are presented and treatment strategies for further reduction of safety margins are outlined. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Multiple planning studies demonstrated the dosimetric advantage of IMRT compared to three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. Though randomized studies are missing, retrospective studies indicate that improved dose distributions of IMRT transfer into improved rates of local control and/or lower rates of rectal toxicity. However, with standard safety margins the benefit of IMRT seems to be limited. Image guidance is considered to be essential to reduce errors of patient setup and internal motion of the prostate",

abstract="The development of the Monte Carlo code SHIELD-HIT (heavy ion transport) for the simulation of the transport of protons and heavier ions in tissue-like media is described. The code SHIELD-HIT, a spin-off of SHIELD (available as RSICC CCC-667), extends the transport of hadron cascades from standard targets to that of ions in arbitrary tissue-like materials, taking into account ionization energy-loss straggling and multiple Coulomb scattering effects. The consistency of the results obtained with SHIELD-HIT has been verified against experimental data and other existing Monte Carlo codes (PTRAN, PETRA), as well as with deterministic models for ion transport, comparing depth distributions of energy deposition by protons, 12C and 20Ne ions impinging on water. The SHIELD-HIT code yields distributions consistent with a proper treatment of nuclear inelastic collisions. Energy depositions up to and well beyond the Bragg peak due to nuclear fragmentations are well predicted. Satisfactory agreement is also found with experimental determinations of the number of fragments of a given type, as a function of depth in water, produced by 12C and 14N ions of 670 MeV u(-1), although less favourable agreement is observed for heavier projectiles such as 16O ions of the same energy. The calculated neutron spectra differential in energy and angle produced in a mimic of a Martian rock by irradiation with 12C ions of 290 MeV u(-1) also shows good agreement with experimental data. It is concluded that a careful analysis of stopping power data for different tissues is necessary for radiation therapy applications, since an incorrect estimation of the position of the Bragg peak might lead to a significant deviation from the prescribed dose in small target volumes. The results presented in this study indicate the usefulness of the SHIELD-HIT code for Monte Carlo simulations in the field of light ion radiation therapy",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Creating linear lesions is important for the treatment of arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and fibrillation. Making these lesions with standard radiofrequency catheters can be difficult and may result in charring and thrombosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate beta-radiation as a novel energy source for creating linear myocardial lesions. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight dogs with intact conduction across the cavotricuspid isthmus were studied. The isthmus was irradiated (25 to 50 Gy) with strontium/yttrium-90 delivered via a deflectable 7F catheter (Novoste Corporation). There were no immediate effects, but bidirectional conduction block developed during follow-up studies in 7 of 8 dogs. The dog without conduction block received 25 Gy. After the animals were euthanized, histology revealed transmural, linear areas of fibrosis without any thrombus. CONCLUSIONS: Beta-radiation can safely and effectively create linear lesions that are contiguous and nonthrombogenic. This energy source may become an interesting adjunct to radiofrequency for the treatment of atrial flutter and fibrillation",

A modified 3D OFM algorithm provided 3D displacement vectors for each voxel which were used to map tumour voxels on expiration BH CT onto inspiration BH CT images. A thoracic phantom and simulated expiration/inspiration BH CT pairs were used for validation. The 3D OFM was applied to the measured inspiration and expiration BH CT images from one lung cancer and one oesophageal cancer patient. The resulting displacements were plotted in histogram format and analysed to provide insight regarding the tumour motion. The phantom tumour displacement was measured as 1.20 and 2.40 cm with full-width at tenth maximum (FWTM) for the distribution of displacement estimates of 0.008 and 0.006 cm, respectively. The maximum error of any single voxel's motion estimate was 1.1 mm along the <I>z</I>-dimension or approximately one-third of the <I>z</I>-dimension voxel size. The simulated BH CT pairs revealed an rms error of less than 0.25 mm. The displacement of the oesophageal tumours was nonuniform and up to 1.4 cm, this was a new finding. A lung tumour maximum displacement of 2.4 cm was found in the case evaluated. In conclusion, 3D OFM provided an accurate estimation of intrathoracic tumour motion, with estimated errors less than the voxel dimension in a simulated motion phantom study. Surprisingly, oesophageal tumour motion was large and nonuniform, with greatest motion occurring at the gastro-oesophageal junction",

abstract="Purpose To determine the relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) of the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) scanning proton beam in reference conditions and to evaluate the influence of intestine motion on the proton dose homogeneity. Methods and Materials: First, RBE was determined for crypt regeneration in mice after irradiation in a single fraction. Irradiation was performed at the middle of a 7-cm spread out Bragg peak (SOBP; reference position), as well as in the proximal part of the plateau and at the distal end of the SOBP. Control [gamma]-irradiation was randomized with proton irradiation and performed simultaneously. Second, motion of mouse intestine was determined by radiographs after copper wire markers had been placed on the jejunum and intestinal wall. Results: Proton RBE (reference 60Co [gamma]) was equal to 1.16 for irradiation at the middle of the SOBP and to 1.11 and 1.21 for irradiation in the initial plateau and end of the SOBP, respectively. The confidence intervals for these RBE values were much larger than those obtained in the other proton beams we have tested so far. They exceeded +/-0.20 (compared with the usual value of +/-0.07), which resulted from the unusually large dispersion of the individual proton data. The instantaneous positions of the mice intestines varied by +/-2 mm in the course of irradiation. Conclusion: The results of this study have shown that the RBE of the PSI proton beam is in total accordance with the RBE obtained at the other centers. This experiment has corroborated that proton RBE at the middle of the SOBP is slightly larger than the generic value of 1.10 and that there is a slight tendency for the RBE to increase close to the end of the SOBP. Also, excessive dispersion of individual proton data may be considered to result from intestine motion, taking into account that irradiation at the PSI is delivered dynamically by scanning the target volume with a pencil proton beam (``spot scanning''). Because 2-mm movements resulted in significant variations in local dose depositions, this should be considered for moving targets. Strategies to reduce this effect for the spot scanning technique have been developed at the PSI for radiotherapy of humans",

Energy spectra of the fragments at angles of 0 degrees, 5 degrees, 10 degrees, 20 degrees and 30 degrees to the beam axis were obtained from time-of-flight measurements. They show a broad maximum at about half of the projectiles energy per nucleon, the shape at high energies is exponential and extends up to the projectiles initial energy per nucleon-for neutrons and protons to about twice the energy of the projectile per nucleon. Comparison of the experimental data with calculations performed with the Monte-Carlo code (partide and heavy ion transport code system (PHITS)) shows fairly good agreement for neutrons, protons and deuterons, but some deviations for tritons and helium fragments.

abstract="BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation ablation is an established therapy; however, limited data are available on associated complications. This systematic review determines the incidence and potential predictors of acute complications. METHODS AND RESULTS: Electronic searches were conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE for English scientific literature up to the 18th June 2012. A total of 2065 references were retrieved and evaluated for relevance. Reference lists of retrieved studies and review articles were examined to ensure all relevant studies were included. Data were extracted from 192 studies, total of 83 236 patients. The incidence of periprocedural complications for catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation was 2.9\% (95\% confidence interval, 2.6-3.2). There was a significant decrease in the acute complication rate in 2007 to 2012 compared with 2000 to 2006 (2.6\% versus 4.0\%; P=0.003). The complication rates reported were higher in prospective studies compared with those that retrospectively described complications (3.5\% versus 2.7\%; P=0.03). There were no significant associations among procedure duration, ablation time or ablation strategy, and acute complication rate. CONCLUSIONS: Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation has a low incidence of periprocedural complications. The acute complication rate has decreased significantly in recent years. This may reflect improved catheter technology and experience. The use of different strategies across centers worldwide seems to be safe with no established relationship between procedural variables and complication rate",

abstract="PURPOSE: Changes in position or size of target volumes have been observed during radiotherapy for lung cancer. The need for adaptive treatment planning during stereotactic radiotherapy of Stage I tumors was retrospectively analyzed using repeat four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) scans. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A planning study was performed for 60 tumors in 59 patients using 4DCT scans repeated after two or more treatment fractions. Planning target volumes (PTV) encompassed all tumor mobility, and dose distributions from the initial plan were projected onto PTVs derived from the repeat 4DCT. A dosimetric and volumetric analysis was performed. RESULTS: The repeat 4DCT scans were performed at a mean of 6.6 days (range, 2-12 days) after the first fraction of stereotactic radiotherapy. In 25\% of cases the repeat PTV was larger, but the difference exceeded 1 mL in 5 patients only. The mean 3D displacement between the center of mass of both PTVs was 2.0 mm. The initial 80\% prescription isodose ensured a mean coverage of 98\% of repeat PTVs, and this isodose fully encompassed the repeat internal target volumes in all but 1 tumor. ``Inadequate'' coverage in the latter was caused by a new area of atelectasis adjacent to the tumor on the repeat 4DCT. CONCLUSIONS: Limited ``time trends'' were observed in PTVs generated by repeated uncoached 4DCT scans, and the dosimetric consequences proved to be minimal. Treatment based only on the initial PTV would not have resulted in major tumor underdosage, indicating that adaptive treatment planning is of limited value for fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy",

abstract="Purpose: Photon-based radiation therapy does currently not play a major role as local ablative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Carbon ions offer distinct physical and biological advantages. Due to their inverted dose profile and the high local dose deposition within the Bragg peak, precise dose application and sparing of normal tissue is possible. Furthermore, carbon ions have an increased relative biological effectiveness (RBE) compared to photons.Methods and materials: A total of six patients with one or more HCC-lesions were treated with carbon ions delivered by the raster-scanning technique according to our clinical trial protocol. Diagnosis of HCC was confirmed by histology or two different imaging modalities (CT and MRI) according to the AASLD-guidelines. Applied fractionation scheme was 4 x 10 Gy(RBE). Correct dose application was controlled by in-vivo PET measurement of beta + -activity in the irradiated tissue shortly after treatment. RESULTS: Patients were observed for a median time period of 11.0 months (range, 3.4 -- 12.7 months). Imaging studies showed a partial response in 4/7 lesions and a stable disease in 3/7 lesions in follow-up CT- and MRI scans. Local control was 100\%. One patient with multifocal intrahepatic disease underwent liver transplantation 3 months after carbon ion therapy. During radiotherapy and the follow-up period no severe adverse events have occurred. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first clinical results of patients undergoing carbon ion therapy using the raster-scanning technique at our institution. All patients are locally controlled and experienced no higher toxicities in a short follow-up period. Further patients will be included in our prospective Phase-I clinical trial PROMETHEUS-01 (NCT01167374)",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Due to physical characteristics, ions like protons or carbon ions can administer the dose to the target volume more efficiently than photons since the dose can be lowered at the surrounding normal tissue. Radiation biological considerations are based on the assumption that the alpha/beta value for prostate cancer cells is 1.5 Gy, so that a biologically more effective dose could be administered due to hypofractionation without increasing risks of late effects of bladder (alpha/beta = 4.0) and rectum (alpha/beta = 3.9). METHODS/DESIGN: The IPI study is a prospective randomized phase II study exploring the safety and feasibility of primary hypofractionated irradiation of the prostate with protons and carbon ions in a raster scan technique. The study is designed to enroll 92 patients with localized prostate cancer. Primary aim is the assessment of the safety and feasibility of the study treatment on the basis of incidence grade III and IV NCI-CTC-AE (v. 4.02) toxicity and/or the dropout of the patient from the planned therapy due to any reason. Secondary endpoints are PSA-progression free survival (PSA-PFS), overall survival (OS) and quality-of-life (QoL). DISCUSSION: This pilot study aims at the evaluation of the safety and feasibility of hypofractionated irradiation of the prostate with protons and carbon ions in prostate cancer patients in an active beam technique. Additionally, the safety results will be compared with Japanese results recently published for carbon ion irradiation. Due to the missing data of protons in this hypofractionated scheme, an in depth evaluation of the toxicity will be created to gain basic data for a following comparison study with carbon ion irradiation.

abstract="Carbon ion beams in the energy range of about 100-450 MeV/u offer excellent conditions for tumour therapy, in particular for the treatment of deep-seated radio-resistant tumours. Their depth-dose distribution is characterized by a low dose in the entrance channel, small lateral beam spread and an elevated biological effectiveness in the Bragg peak region. In comparison to protons the radiation field of heavier ions stopping in tissue is however more complex due to nuclear fragmentation reactions occurring along their stopping path. This results in an attenuation of the primary beam flux and a build-up of lower-Z fragments with longer ranges causing the characteristic dose tail beyond the Bragg peak. In the present work the characteristics of secondary charged particles at various depths of water were investigated experimentally using (12)C ion beams of 200 and 400 MeV/u delivered by the heavy-ion synchrotron SIS-18 at GSI Darmstadt. The nuclear charge Zf of secondary fragments was identified by combining energy loss and time-of-flight (TOF) measurements. Energy spectra and yields were recorded at lab angles of 0 degrees - 10 degrees and at seven different water depths corresponding to the entrance channel, the Bragg peak region and the tail of the Bragg curve",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation, the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and a major cause of stroke, results from simultaneous reentrant wavelets. Its spontaneous initiation has not been studied. METHODS: We studied 45 patients with frequent episodes of atrial fibrillation (mean [+/-SD] duration, 344+/-326 minutes per 24 hours) refractory to drug therapy. The spontaneous initiation of atrial fibrillation was mapped with the use of multielectrode catheters designed to record the earliest electrical activity preceding the onset of atrial fibrillation and associated atrial ectopic beats. The accuracy of the mapping was confirmed by the abrupt disappearance of triggering atrial ectopic beats after ablation with local radio-frequency energy. RESULTS: A single point of origin of atrial ectopic beats was identified in 29 patients, two points of origin were identified in 9 patients, and three or four points of origin were identified in 7 patients, for a total of 69 ectopic foci. Three foci were in the right atrium, 1 in the posterior left atrium, and 65 (94 percent) in the pulmonary veins (31 in the left superior, 17 in the right superior, 11 in the left inferior, and 6 in the right inferior pulmonary vein). The earliest activation was found to have occurred 2 to 4 cm inside the veins, marked by a local depolarization preceding the atrial ectopic beats on the surface electrocardiogram by 106+/-24 msec. Atrial fibrillation was initiated by a sudden burst of rapid depolarizations (340 per minute). A local depolarization could also be recognized during sinus rhythm and abolished by radiofrequency ablation. During a follow-up period of 8+/-6 months after ablation, 28 patients (62 percent) had no recurrence of atrial fibrillation. CONCLUSIONS: The pulmonary veins are an important source of ectopic beats, initiating frequent paroxysms of atrial fibrillation. These foci respond to treatment with radio-frequency ablation",

abstract="Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) allows dose to be concentrated in the tumor volume while sparing normal tissues. However, the downside to IMRT is the potential to increase the number of radiation-induced second cancers. The reasons for this potential are more monitor units and, therefore, a larger total-body dose because of leakage radiation and, because IMRT involves more fields, a bigger volume of normal tissue is exposed to lower radiation doses. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy may double the incidence of solid cancers in long-term survivors. This outcome may be acceptable in older patients if balanced by an improvement in local tumor control and reduced acute toxicity. On the other hand, the incidence of second cancers is much higher in children, so that doubling it may not be acceptable. IMRT represents a special case for children for three reasons. First, children are more sensitive to radiation-induced cancer than are adults. Second, radiation scattered from the treatment volume is more important in the small body of the child. Third, the question of genetic susceptibility arises because many childhood cancers involve a germline mutation. The levels of leakage radiation in current Linacs are not inevitable. Leakage can be reduced but at substantial cost. An alternative strategy is to replace X-rays with protons. However, this change is only an advantage if the proton machine employs a pencil scanning beam. Many proton facilities use passive modulation to produce a field of sufficient size, but the use of a scattering foil produces neutrons, which results in an effective dose to the patient higher than that characteristic of IMRT. The benefit of protons is only achieved if a scanning beam is used in which the doses are 10 times lower than with IMRT",

abstract="Protons represent a logical step forward as a modality for radiotherapy because it is possible to concentrate dose in the tumor region and minimize dose to normal tissue. The pencil beam emerging from a cyclotron or synchrotron needs to be expanded to a larger size to cover tumors of realistic size. Ideally, this should be accomplished by scanning the pencil beam using magnetic fields, but this is technically challenging. The simpler method is to use passive modulation, the downside of which is that neutrons are produced in the scattering foil, which results in a total body dose to the patient. Neutrons are highly effective at inducing second cancers and so, for the full potential of protons to be realized, spot scanning is essential",

abstract="The technologies available to identify anatomical structures (including radiotherapy target and normal tissue 'volumes'), and to deliver dose accurately to these volumes, have improved significantly in the past decade. However, the ability of clinicians to identify volumes accurately and consistently in patients still suffers from uncertainties that arise from human error, inadequate training, lack of consensus on the derivation of volumes and inadequate characterisation of the accuracy and specificity of imaging technologies. Inadequate volume definition of a target can result in treatment failure and, consequently, disease progression; excessive volume may also lead to unnecessary patient injury. This is a serious problem in routine clinical care. In the context of large multi-centre clinical trials, uncertainty and inconsistency in tissue-volume reporting will be carried through to the analysis of treatment effect on outcome, which will subsequently influence the treatment of future patients. Strategies need to be set in place to ensure that the abilities and consistency of clinicians in defining volumes are aligned with the ability of new technologies to present volumetric information.

abstract="The technologies available to identify anatomical structures (including radiotherapy target and normal tissue 'volumes'), and to deliver dose accurately to these volumes, have improved significantly in the past decade. However, the ability of clinicians to identify volumes accurately and consistently in patients still suffers from uncertainties that arise from human error, inadequate training, lack of consensus on the derivation of volumes and inadequate characterisation of the accuracy and specificity of imaging technologies. Inadequate volume definition of a target can result in treatment failure and, consequently, disease progression; excessive volume may also lead to unnecessary patient injury. This is a serious problem in routine clinical care. In the context of large multi-centre clinical trials, uncertainty and inconsistency in tissue-volume reporting will be carried through to the analysis of treatment effect on outcome, which will subsequently influence the treatment of future patients. Strategies need to be set in place to ensure that the abilities and consistency of clinicians in defining volumes are aligned with the ability of new technologies to present volumetric information. This review seeks to define the concept of volumetric uncertainty and propose a conceptual model that has these errors evaluated and responded to separately. Specifically, we will explore the major causes, consequences of, and possible remediation of volumetric uncertainty, from the point of view of a multidisciplinary radiotherapy clinical environment",

abstract="PURPOSE: Monte Carlo methods are used to simulate and optimize a time-resolved proton range telescope (TRRT) in localization of intrafractional and interfractional motions of lung tumor and in quantification of proton range variations. METHODS: The Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended (MCNPX) code with a particle tracking feature was employed to evaluate the TRRT performance, especially in visualizing and quantifying proton range variations during respiration. Protons of 230 MeV were tracked one by one as they pass through position detectors, patient 4DCT phantom, and finally scintillator detectors that measured residual ranges. The energy response of the scintillator telescope was investigated. Mass density and elemental composition of tissues were defined for 4DCT data. RESULTS: Proton water equivalent length (WEL) was deduced by a reconstruction algorithm that incorporates linear proton track and lateral spatial discrimination to improve the image quality. 4DCT data for three patients were used to visualize and measure tumor motion and WEL variations. The tumor trajectories extracted from the WEL map were found to be within 1 mm agreement with direct 4DCT measurement. Quantitative WEL variation studies showed that the proton radiograph is a good representation of WEL changes from entrance to distal of the target. CONCLUSIONS: MCNPX simulation results showed that TRRT can accurately track the motion of the tumor and detect the WEL variations. Image quality was optimized by choosing proton energy, testing parameters of image reconstruction algorithm, and comparing to ground truth 4DCT. The future study will demonstrate the feasibility of using the time resolved proton radiography as an imaging tool for proton treatments of lung tumors",

Manual contouring is tedious and suffers from large inter- and intra-rater variability. To reduce manual labor, we have developed a fully automated, atlas-based method for H\&N CT image segmentation that employs a novel hierarchical atlas registration approach. This registration strategy makes use of object shape information in the atlas to help improve the registration efficiency and robustness while still being able to account for large inter-subject shape differences. Validation results showed that our method provides accurate segmentation for many structures despite difficulties presented by real clinical data.

abstract="Purpose/Objective: This study evaluates the dosimetric benefits and feasibility of a deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) technique in the treatment of lung tumors. The technique has two distinct features?deep inspiration, which reduces lung density, and breath-hold, which immobilizes lung tumors, thereby allowing for reduced margins. Both of these properties can potentially reduce the amount of normal lung tissue in the high-dose region, thus reducing morbidity and improving the possibility of dose escalation.Methods and Materials: Five patients treated for non-small cell lung carcinoma (Stage IIA-IIIB) received computed tomography (CT) scans under 4 respiration conditions: free-breathing, DIBH, shallow inspiration breath-hold, and shallow expiration breath-hold. The free-breathing and DIBH scans were used to generate 3-dimensional conformal treatment plans for comparison, while the shallow inspiration and expiration scans determined the extent of tumor motion under free-breathing conditions. To acquire the breath-hold scans, the patients are brought to reproducible respiration levels using spirometry, and for DIBH, modified slow vital capacity maneuvers. Planning target volumes (PTVs) for free-breathing plans included a margin for setup error (0.75 cm) plus a margin equal to the extent of tumor motion due to respiration (1-2 cm). Planning target volumes for DIBH plans included the same margin for setup error, with a reduced margin for residual uncertainty in tumor position (0.2-0.5 cm) as determined from repeat fluoroscopic movies. To simulate the effects of respiration-gated treatments and estimate the role of target immobilization alone (i.e., without the benefit of reduced lung density), a third plan is generated from the free-breathing scan using a PTV with the same margins as for DIBH plans.Results: The treatment plan comparison suggests that, on average, the DIBH technique can reduce the volume of lung receiving more than 25 Gy by 30\% compared to free-breathing plans, while respiration gating can reduce the volume by 18\%. The DIBH maneuver was found to be highly reproducible, with intra breath-hold reproducibility of 1.0 (-{\backslash}pm 0.9) mm and inter breath-hold reproducibility of 2.5 (-{\backslash}pm 1.6) mm, as determined from diaphragm position. Patients were able to perform 10-13 breath-holds in one session, with a comfortable breath-hold duration of 12-16 s.Conclusion: Patients tolerate DIBH maneuvers well and can perform them in a highly reproducible fashion. Compared to conventional free-breathing treatment, the DIBH technique benefits from reduced margins, as a result of the suppressed target motion, as well as a decreased lung density; both contribute to moving normal lung tissue out of the high-dose region. Because less normal lung tissue is irradiated to high dose, the possibility for dose escalation is significantly improved",

abstract="BACKGROUND: The authors developed fluoroscopic real-time tumor-tracking radiation therapy (RTRT) by insertion of a gold marker using bronchofiberscopy to reduce uncertainties in organ motion and set-up error in external radiotherapy for moving tumors. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate RTRT's feasibility in lung carcinoma treatment. METHODS: The three-dimensional position of a 1.0-2.0 mm gold marker in or near the tumor was detected by two sets of fluoroscopies every 0.03 seconds. The treatment beam was gated to irradiate the tumor only when the position of the marker coincided with its planned position using the RTRT system. Bronchofiberscopic equipment for insertion of the marker into the lung tumor was developed and used for 20 lung tumors in 18 patients. Patients were given high dose hypofractionated focal irradiation (35-48 Gy in 4-8 fractions in 4-10 days) with a planning target volume margin of 5 mm for the tumor. RESULTS: The markers were successfully inserted and maintained at the inserted position during and after the radiotherapy in 14 (88\%) of 16 peripheral-type lung tumors and in none of four central-type lung tumors, indicating that this method of RTRT was not feasible for central-type lung tumors. Tracking of the marker was successfully performed in 1 of 2 tumors with a 1.0 mm marker and in all of 12 tumors with a 1.5-2.0 mm marker. On the whole, 13 (65\%) of the 20 tumors were successfully treated with RTRT. Local tumor control was achieved and maintained for all 12 patients (13 tumors), who were treated with RTRT, with a median followup of 9 months (range, 5-15). Localized radiation pneumonitis was found radiographically at the lung volume that was irradiated with about 20 Gy, without symptoms in all but one patient. CONCLUSIONS: The insertion of a gold marker into or near peripheral-type lung tumors using bronchofiberscopy is a feasible and safe technique. Excellent initial response and low incidence of clinical complications suggest that the high dose hypofractionated focal irradiation using the RTRT system can be a good local treatment for peripheral-type lung tumors",

abstract="We have evaluated a 4D ultrasound-based motion tracking system developed for tracking of abdominal organs during therapy. Tracking accuracy and precision were determined using a tissue-mimicking phantom, by comparing tracked motion with known 3D sinusoidal motion. The feasibility of tracking 3D liver motion in vivo was evaluated by acquiring 4D ultrasound data from four healthy volunteers. For two of these volunteers, data were also acquired whilst simultaneously measuring breath flow using a spirometer. Hepatic blood vessels, tracked off-line using manual tracking, were used as a reference to assess, in vivo, two types of automated tracking algorithm: incremental (from one volume to the next) and non-incremental (from the first volume to each subsequent volume). For phantom-based experiments, accuracy and precision (RMS error and SD) were found to be 0.78 mm and 0.54 mm, respectively. For in vivo measurements, mean absolute distance and standard deviation of the difference between automatically and manually tracked displacements were less than 1.7 mm and 1 mm respectively in all directions (left-right, anterior-posterior and superior-inferior). In vivo non-incremental tracking gave the best agreement. In both phantom and in vivo experiments, tracking performance was poorest for the elevational component of 3D motion. Good agreement between automatically and manually tracked displacements indicates that 4D ultrasound-based motion tracking has potential for image guidance applications in therapy",

abstract="PURPOSE: The self-developing Gafchromic EBT film is a radiochromic film, widely used for relative photon dosimetry. Recently, the manufacturer has replaced the well-investigated EBT film by the new Gafchromic EBT2 film. It has the same sensitive component and, in addition, it contains a yellow marker dye in order to protect the film against ambient light exposure and to serve as a base for corrections of small differences in film response. Furthermore, the configuration of the film layers as well as the binder material have been changed in comparison to the EBT film. When investigating the properties of EBT2 film, all characteristics were found to be similar to those of EBT film, except for the film response homogeneity. Thus, in this article special focus was put on examining the homogeneity of EBT2 film. METHODS: A scan protocol established for EBT film and published previously was used. The uniformity of the film coloration was investigated for unirradiated and irradiated EBT2 film sheets. The dose response of EBT2 film was measured and the influence of film inhomogeneities on dose determination was evaluated. RESULTS: Inhomogeneities in pixel values of up to +/- 3.7\% within one film were detected. The relative inhomogeneities were found to be approximately independent of the dose. Nonuniformities of the film response lead to uncertainties in dose determination of +/- 8.7\% at 1 Gy. When using net optical densities for dose calibration, uncertainties in dose determination amount to more than +/- 6\%. CONCLUSIONS: EBT2 films from the lot investigated in this study show response inhomogeneities, which lead to uncertainties in dose determination exceeding the commonly accepted tolerance levels. It is important to test further EBT2 lots regarding homogeneity before using the film in clinical routine",

abstract="Increased accuracy in radiation delivery to a patient provided by scanning particle beams leads to high demands on quality assurance (QA). To meet the requirements, an extensive quality assurance programme has been implemented at the Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Center. Currently, high-resolution radiographic films are used for beam spot position measurements and homogeneity measurements for scanned fields. However, given that using this film type is time and equipment demanding, considerations have been made to replace the radiographic films in QA by another appropriate device. In this study, the suitability of the flat-panel detector RID 256 L based on amorphous silicon was investigated as an alternative method. The currently used radiographic films were taken as a reference. Investigations were carried out for proton and carbon ion beams. The detectors were irradiated simultaneously to allow for a direct comparison. The beam parameters (e.g. energy, focus, position) currently used in the daily QA procedures were applied. Evaluation of the measurements was performed using newly implemented automatic routines. The results for the flat-panel detector were compared to the standard radiographic films. Additionally, a field with intentionally decreased homogeneity was applied to test the detector's sensitivities toward possible incorrect scan parameters. For the beam position analyses, the flat-panel detector results showed good agreement with radiographic films. For both detector types, deviations between measured and planned spot distances were found to be below 1\% (1 mm). In homogeneously irradiated fields, the flat-panel detector showed a better dose response homogeneity than the currently used radiographic film. Furthermore, the flat-panel detector is sensitive to field irregularities. The flat-panel detector was found to be an adequate replacement for the radiographic film in QA measurements. In addition, it saves time and equipment because no post-exposure treatment and no developer and darkroom facilities are needed",

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The technique of convergent beam irradiation, that is a series of successive isocentric arc irradiations, is specifically considered in this paper. Accuracy and precision depend on a sequence of methods and equipment among which localization of the target, patient alignment, and the dose delivery are the most critical steps. The purpose of the investigation was to quantitatively assess their contribution to the overall accuracy. The definitions and methods used to quantify and control accuracy are described. Measurements were carried out at a phantom to analyze the localization and positioning errors. Errors which may occur with the dose delivery technique were studied by a computer simulation. RESULTS: The calculations showed that these errors are not the main contributors to the overall accuracy as long as the linac inaccuracies are in the order or less than 1 mm. The accuracy found in the localization and positioning methods was less than 1 mm. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that an overall accuracy in the order of 1 mm can be obtained also under routine conditions. The great importance of adequate quality control is emphasized",

abstract="PURPOSE: To present treatment outcomes of hypofractionated high-dose proton beam therapy for Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one patients with Stage I NSCLC (11 with Stage IA and 10 with Stage IB) underwent hypofractionated high-dose proton beam therapy. At the time of irradiation, patient age ranged from 51 to 85 years (median, 74 years). Nine patients were medically inoperable because of comorbidities, and 12 patients refused surgical resection. Histology was squamous cell carcinoma in 6 patients, adenocarcinoma in 14, and large cell carcinoma in 1. Tumor size ranged from 10 to 42 mm (median, 25 mm) in maximum diameter. Three and 18 patients received proton beam irradiation with total doses of 50 Gy and 60 Gy in 10 fractions, respectively, to primary tumor sites. RESULTS: Of 21 patients, 2 died of cancer and 2 died of pneumonia at a median follow-up period of 25 months. The 2-year overall and cause-specific survival rates were 74\% and 86\%, respectively. All but one of the irradiated tumors were controlled during the follow-up period. Five patients showed recurrences 6-29 months after treatment, including local progression and new lung lesions outside of the irradiated volume in 1 and 4 patients, respectively. The local progression-free and disease-free rates were 95\% and 79\% at 2 years, respectively. No therapy-related toxicity of Grade > or =3 was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Hypofractionated high-dose proton beam therapy seems feasible and effective for Stage I NSCLC. Proton beams may contribute to enhanced efficacy and lower toxicity in the treatment of patients with Stage I NSCLC",

abstract="OBJECTIVE: High-risk prostate cancer patients are at risk for subclinical disease and micro-metastasis at the time of treatment. Nowadays, tight margins reduce dose to periprostatic areas compared to earlier techniques. We investigated whether rectangular fields were associated with fewer failures compared to conformal fields (with lower extraprostatic dose). METHODS: We selected 164 high-risk patients from the trial population of 266 T1-T4N0M0 patients, randomized between rectangular (n=79) and conformal fields (n=85). Prescribed dose was 66 Gy to the prostate and seminal vesicles plus 15 mm margin. We compared clinical failure rates (in- and excluding local failures), between both arms. Dose differences around the prostate were calculated based on an inter-patient mapping method. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 34 months. There were 9 clinical failures in the rectangular arm versus 24 in the conformal arm (p=0.012). Number of failures outside the prostate was 7 and 19, respectively (p=0.025). We observed average dose differences of 5-35 Gy between the arms in the regions around the prostate. CONCLUSIONS: We found a significantly lower risk of early tumor progression for patients treated with rectangular fields. Treatment failure can probably in part be prevented by irradiation of areas suspected of subclinical disease in high-risk prostate cancer",

Intraoperatively, after open reduction, a cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) dataset was generated using the SIREMOBIL Iso-C3D (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). After DICOM-import in eFilm Workstation axial, coronal and sagittal reconstructions were evaluated by five examiners with the help of six defined criteria. In our study, secondary reconstructions were available after 6 min, excluding the time needed for the evaluation of the images. Especially the positioning of the isocentre of the SIREMOBIL Iso-C3D proved to be uncomplicated. Because of the size of the datasets, assessment of the symmetry of the malar projection proved difficult. Best scoring results were found regarding the visualization of the fragment position, bony anchorage of the screws and the fitting of the plates. Remarkable was the low level of metal artefacts in primary and secondary reconstructions. In conclusion, our results demonstrate intraoperative CBCT using the SIREMOBIL Iso-C3D suitable for assessment of postoperative results following ZMC reduction",

abstract="PURPOSE: The study was aimed at the measurement of effect-depth distributions of intracellularly induced DNA damage in water as tissue equivalent after heavy ion irradiation with therapy particle beams. METHODS AND MATERIALS: An assay involving embedding of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells in large agarose plugs and electrophoretic elution of radiation induced DNA fragments by constant field gel electrophoresis was developed. Double-strand break production was quantified by densitometric analysis of DNA-fluorescence after staining with ethidium-bromide and determination of the fraction of DNA eluted out of the agarose plugs. Intracellular double-strand break induction and the effect of a 3 h rejoining incubation were investigated following irradiation with 250 kV x-rays and 109 MeV/u carbon- and 295 MeV/u neon-ions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: While the DNA damage induced by x-irradiation decreased continuously with penetration depth, a steady increase in the yield of double-strand breaks was observed for particle radiation, reaching distinct maxima at the position of the physical Bragg peaks. Beyond this, the extent of radiation damage dropped drastically. From comparison of DNA damage and calculated dose profiles, relative biological efficiencies (RBEs) for both double-strand break induction and unrejoined strand breaks after 3 h were determined. While RBE for the induction of DNA double-strand breaks decreased continuously with penetration depth, RBE maxima greater than unity were found with carbon- and neon-ions for double-strand break rejoining near the maximum range of the particles. The method presented here allows for a fast and accurate determination of depth profiles of relevant radiobiological effects for mixed particle fields in tissue equivalent",

abstract="PURPOSE: Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) are a useful tool in state-of-the-art radiotherapy treatment planning, and it is essential to recognize their limitations. Even after a specific dose-calculation model is optimized, dose distributions computed by using treatment-planning systems are affected by several sources of uncertainty, such as algorithm limitations, measurement uncertainty in the data used to model the beam, and residual differences between measured and computed dose. This report presents a novel method to take them into account. METHODS AND MATERIALS: To take into account the effect of associated uncertainties, a probabilistic approach using a new kind of histogram, a dose-expected volume histogram, is introduced. The expected value of the volume in the region of interest receiving an absorbed dose equal to or greater than a certain value is found by using the probability distribution of the dose at each point. A rectangular probability distribution is assumed for this point dose, and a formulation that accounts for uncertainties associated with point dose is presented for practical computations. RESULTS: This method is applied to a set of DVHs for different regions of interest, including 6 brain patients, 8 lung patients, 8 pelvis patients, and 6 prostate patients planned for intensity-modulated radiation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Results show a greater effect on planning target volume coverage than in organs at risk. In cases of steep DVH gradients, such as planning target volumes, this new method shows the largest differences with the corresponding DVH; thus, the effect of the uncertainty is larger",

abstract="Clinical radiotherapy procedures aim at high accuracy. However, there are many error sources that act during treatment preparation and execution that limit the accuracy. As a consequence, a safety margin is required to ensure that the planned dose is actually delivered to the target for (almost) all patients. Before treatment planning, a planning computed tomography scan is made. In particular, motion of skin with respect to the internal anatomy limits the reproducibility of this step, introducing a systematic setup error. The second important error source is organ motion. The tumor is imaged in an arbitrary position, leading to a systematic organ motion error. The image may also be distorted because of the interference of the scanning process and organ motion. A further systematic error introduced during treatment planning is caused by the delineation process. During treatment, the most important errors are setup error and organ motion leading to day-to-day variations. There are many ways to define the margins required for these errors. In this article, an overview is given of errors in radiotherapy and margin recipes, based on physical and biological considerations. Respiration motion is treated separately",

abstract="PURPOSE: Knowledge about the mobility of organs relative to the bony anatomy is of great importance when preparing and verifying conformal radiotherapy. The conventional technique for measuring the motion of an organ is to locate landmarks on the organ and the bony anatomy and to compare the distance between these landmarks on subsequent computerized tomography (CT) scans. The first purpose of this study is to investigate the use of a three dimensional (3D) image registration method based on chamfer matching for measurement of the location and orientation of the whole organ relative to the bony anatomy. The second purpose is to quantify organ motion during conformal therapy of the prostate. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four CT scans were made during the course of conformal treatment of 11 patients with prostate cancer. With the use of a 3D treatment planning system, the prostate and seminal vesicles were contoured interactively. In addition, bladder and rectum were contoured and the volume computed. Next, the bony anatomy of subsequent scans was segmented and matched automatically on the first scan. The femora and the pelvic bone were matched separately to quantify motion of the legs. Prostate (and seminal vesicle) contours from the subsequent scans were matched on the corresponding contours of the first scan, resulting in the 3D rotations and translations that describe the motion of the prostate and seminal vesicles relative to the pelvic bone. RESULTS: Bone matching of two scans with about 50 slices of 256 x 256 pixels takes about 2 min on a workstation and achieves subpixel registration accuracy. Matching of the organ contours takes about 30 s. The accuracy in determining the relative movement of the prostate is 0.5 to 0.9 mm for translations (depending on the axis) and 1 degree for rotations (standard deviations). Because all organ contours are used for matching, small differences in delineation of the prostate, missing slices, or differences in slice distance have only a limited influence on the accuracy. Rotations of the femora and the pelvic bone are quantified with about 0.4 degree accuracy. A strong correlation was found between rectal volume and anterior-posterior translation and rotation around the left-right axis of the prostate. Consequently, these parameters had the largest standard deviations of 2.7 mm and 4.0 degrees. Bladder filling had much less influence. Less significant correlations were found between various leg rotations and pelvic and prostate motion. Standard deviations of the rotation angles of the pelvic bone were less than 1 degree in all directions. CONCLUSIONS: Using 3D image registration, the motion of organs relative to bony anatomy has been quantified accurately. Uncertainties in contouring and visual interpretation of the scans have a much smaller influence on the measurement of organ displacement with our new method than with conventional methods. We have quantified correlations between rectal filling, leg motions, and prostate motion",

abstract="PURPOSE: To provide an analytical description of the effect of random and systematic geometrical deviations on the target dose in radiotherapy and to derive margin rules. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The cumulative dose distribution delivered to the clinical target volume (CTV) is expressed analytically. Geometrical deviations are separated into treatment execution (random) and treatment preparation (systematic) variations. The analysis relates each possible preparation (systematic) error to the dose distribution over the CTV and allows computation of the probability distribution of, for instance, the minimum dose delivered to the CTV. RESULTS: The probability distributions of the cumulative dose over a population of patients are called dose-population histograms in short. Large execution (random) variations lead to CTV underdosage for a large number of patients, while the same level of preparation (systematic) errors leads to a much larger underdosage for some of the patients. A single point on the histogram gives a simple ``margin recipe.'' For example, to ensure a minimum dose to the CTV of 95\% for 90\% of the patients, a margin between CTV and planning target volume (PTV) is required of 2.5 times the total standard deviation (SD) of preparation (systematic) errors (Sigma) plus 1.64 times the total SD of execution (random) errors (sigma') combined with the penumbra width, minus 1.64 times the SD describing the penumbra width (sigma(p)). For a sigma(p) of 3.2 mm, this recipe can be simplified to 2.5 Sigma + 0.7 sigma'. Because this margin excludes rotational errors and shape deviations, it must be considered as a lower limit for safe radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Dose-population histograms provide insight into the effects of geometrical deviations on a population of patients. Using a dose-probability based approach, simple algorithms for choosing margins were derived",

abstract="To account for geometric uncertainties during radiotherapy, safety margins are applied. In many cases, these margins overlap organs at risk, thereby limiting dose escalation. The aim of image-guided radiotherapy is to improve the accuracy by imaging tumors and critical structures on the machine just before irradiation. The availability of high-quality imaging systems and automatic image registration on the machine leads to many new clinical applications, such as high-precision hypofractionated treatments of brain metastases and solitary long tumors with online tumor position corrections. In this review, the prerequisites for image guidance in terms of planning, image acquisition, and processing are first described. Then, the various methods of correction are discussed such as table shifts and rotation and direct adaptation of machine parameters. Then, online, offline, and intrafraction correction strategies are discussed. Finally, some imaging dose issues are discussed showing that kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography guidance has a net positive impact on the integral dose; the gain caused by margin reduction is larger than the image dose. We can conclude that image-guided radiotherapy is very much a clinical reality and that the development of optimal clinical protocols should currently be the focus of research",

abstract="INTRODUCTION: Fiducial markers based on a removable stent are currently used in image guided radiotherapy. Here it is investigated what the possible dosimetric impact of such a marker could be, if used in proton or carbon ion treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The simulations have been done using the Monte Carlo particle transport code FLUKA with its default hadron therapy settings. A 3 cm long stent is approximated in FLUKA by stacking hollow tori. To simulate realistic clinical conditions a field 5 x 5 cm has been used, delivering a 5 cm wide spread out Bragg peak located 5 cm deep for protons and carbon ions. For protons fields mimicking active and passive beam delivery have been investigated. The stent has been arranged perpendicular, turned 45 degrees, and parallel to the beam axis. RESULTS: The position of the 95\% dose level shifts for carbon ions 7 mm in proximal direction for the marker perpendicular to the beam and 8 mm if the stent is turned 45 degree for a 1 x 1 cm dose binning on the centre beam axis. For the case where the stent was parallel to beam direction the 95\% dose level shifts 26 mm. For active delivered protons, the shift of the 95\% dose level is less. The shift for a perpendicular arranged marker is 6 mm, for 45 degrees turned it is 7 mm. For the case where the stent was oriented parallel to the beam, the observed shift is 21 mm. Dose inhomogeneities caused by straggling effects occur only near the distal edge of the field. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our investigations show that the Ni-Ti marker has a non negligible impact on the dose distributions for the used radiation types. However if the treatment plan rules out narrow angles between symmetry axis of the stent and the beam direction, this may be compensated",

abstract="PURPOSE: To provide methods for quantification of uncertainties in 4-dimensional (4D) treatment during treatment planning. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Uncertainty information was generated by multiple 4D treatment simulations with varying parameters. Sampled data were analyzed using uncertainty visualization methods that have been added to common treatment plan evaluation methods (eg, dose-volume histogram and dose distribution analysis). To illustrate the potential of the introduced methods, uncertainty analysis was completed for a single lung cancer case using 3 motion mitigation techniques: gating, slice-by-slice rescanning, and breath-controlled rescanning. RESULTS: By repeating 4D dose calculations with varying parameters, we were able to show local uncertainties in dose distributions and to evaluate the stability of treatment setups. The new methods were found suitable for uncertainty evaluation in 4D treatment planning of moving tumors. Calculation time of the uncertainty base data was time consuming but contrivable overnight. CONCLUSIONS: Uncertainty analysis and visualization for 4D treatment planning provide an important tool in the decision process for an optimal treatment approach",

abstract="PURPOSE: Particle therapy (PT) has advantages over photon irradiation on static tumors. An increased biological effectiveness and active target conformal dose shaping are strong arguments for PT. However, the sensitivity to changes of internal geometry complicates the use of PT for moving organs. In case of interfractionally moving objects adaptive radiotherapy (ART) concepts known from intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) can be adopted for PT treatments. One ART strategy is to optimize a new treatment plan based on daily image data directly before a radiation fraction is delivered [treatment replanning (TRP)]. Optimizing treatment plans for PT using a scanned beam is a time consuming problem especially for particles other than protons where the biological effective dose has to be calculated. For the purpose of TRP, fast optimization and fast dose calculation have been implemented into the GSI in-house treatment planning system (TPS) TRiP98. METHODS: This work reports about the outcome of a code analysis that resulted in optimization of the calculation processes as well as implementation of routines supporting parallel execution of the code. To benchmark the new features, the calculation time for therapy treatment planning has been studied. RESULTS: Compared to the original version of the TPS, calculation times for treatment planning (optimization and dose calculation) have been improved by a factor of 10 with code optimization. The parallelization of the TPS resulted in a speedup factor of 12 and 5.5 for the original version and the code optimized version, respectively. Hence the total speedup of the new implementation of the authors' TPS yielded speedup factors up to 55. CONCLUSIONS: The improved TPS is capable of completing treatment planning for ion beam therapy of a prostate irradiation considering organs at risk in this has been overseen in the review process.

There is, consequently, widespread interest in accurately relating information in the different images for diagnosis, treatment and basic science. This article reviews registration techniques used to solve this problem, and describes the wide variety of applications to which these techniques are applied. Applications of image registration include combining images of the same subject from different modalities, aligning temporal sequences of images to compensate for motion of the subject between scans, image guidance during interventions and aligning images from multiple subjects in cohort studies. Current registration algorithms can, in many cases, automatically register images that are related by a rigid body transformation (i.e. where tissue deformation can be ignored). There has also been substantial progress in non-rigid registration algorithms that can compensate for tissue deformation, or align images from different subjects. Nevertheless many registration problems remain unsolved, and this is likely to continue to be an active field of research in the future",

abstract="Four-dimensional (4D) respiratory correlated computed tomography (RCCT) has been widely used for studying organ motion. Most current RCCT imaging algorithms use binning techniques that are susceptible to artifacts and challenge the quantitative analysis of organ motion. In this paper, we develop an algorithm for analyzing organ motion which uses the raw, time-stamped imaging data to reconstruct images while simultaneously estimating deformation in the subject's anatomy. This results in reduction of artifacts and facilitates a reduction in dose to the patient during scanning while providing equivalent or better image quality as compared to RCCT. The framework also incorporates fundamental physical properties of organ motion, such as the conservation of local tissue volume. We demonstrate that this approach is accurate and robust against noise and irregular breathing patterns. We present results for a simulated cone beam CT phantom, as well as a detailed real porcine liver phantom study demonstrating accuracy and robustness of the algorithm. An example of applying this algorithm to real patient image data is also presented",

Marketing data and financial records were analyzed to determine the effectiveness of each recruitment method.Results The total amount spent on advertising was \$144,668, with the cost of enrollment per participant averaging \$130. For black participants, the recruitment cost per person was \$406, whereas for white and other race participants, the cost was \$122 (P < 0.0001). To encourage minority enrollment, \$13,192 was spent on television advertising geared toward black viewers, resulting in eight black participants at an average cost per person of \$1,649. Direct mailing cost \$143 per participant recruited, whereas TV ads cost \$382 per participant.Conclusion Direct mailing to a targeted group was the most efficient way to recruit participants. Printed advertising methods, that is, newspaper ads and brochures, were quite effective, whereas television ads were expensive. Appropriate minority recruitment needs sufficient attention and resources to ensure census groups are adequately represented",

In this scheme, the amplitude of the betatron oscillations inside the constant separatrix is increased by electromagnetic transverse or longitudinal perturbations, or scattering by other particles. Particles outside the separatrix are extracted through nonlinear resonance. The scheme is applied to the second order resonant extraction in the computer simulations. As a measure of transverse perturbation, the filtered noise and monochromatic signal are studied. The position of the extracted beam in the phase space is found to be nearly constant, meaning that the emittance of the extracted beam almost vanishes",

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A homogenous phantom was irradiated separately by carbon-ion and proton beams and the images obtained were compared. The PET images of cancer patients just after proton RT were then taken after informed consent. RESULTS: In the PET image produced by carbon-ion beams, the high pixel counts in the image corresponded to the Bragg peak; however, in that produced by proton beams, they were visible throughout the entire track of the proton beams and were not related to the Bragg peak. The PET image of patients treated with proton RT was similar to that of the phantom experiment. CONCLUSION: The PET image after proton RT was different from that of carbon-ion RT. It was found that the PET image was very useful in proton RT to verify treatment planning",

abstract="PurposeThe treatment of early-stage lung cancers is a primary domain of thoracic surgery, leading to persuasive results. In patients with medical contraindications, radiotherapy is an alternative, although with considerably worse outcome. Radiotherapy is associated with the risk of severe acute side effects and a permanent decrease of lung function. By the introduction of an extracranial stereotactic treatment technique, the amount of normal tissue in the high-dose region can be reduced, allowing the performance of single-dose treatment with high, biologically effective doses.Methods and materialsBetween October 1998 and May 2001, 10 patients with histologically confirmed Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer were treated with stereotactic single-dose radiotherapy. A self-developed stereotactic frame was used for patient positioning and navigation. Total doses applied ranged from 19 to 26 Gy. After treatment, regular CT-based follow-up was performed.ResultsDuring a median follow-up period of 14.9 months, the tumors in 8 of 10 patients were locally controlled. The actuarial overall survival was 80\% and 64\%, respectively, 12 and 24 months after therapy. Actuarial local recurrence-free survival reached 88.9\% and 71.1\%, respectively. Therapy-related perifocal normal-tissue reaction occurred in 70\% of all treated patients, although no major clinical symptoms were seen. In 5 patients, systemic metastases were found during follow-up; 1 patient developed suspect mediastinal lymph nodes.ConclusionStereotactic single-fraction radiotherapy is a feasible, safe, and effective procedure for the treatment of Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer. It promises high local control with a reduced overall treatment time. However, further investigation in a larger patient collective with extended follow-up is necessary",

abstract="BACKGROUND: The clinical results after stereotactic single-dose radiotherapy of nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stages I and II were evaluated. METHODS: Forty-two patients with biopsy-proven NSCLC received stereotactic radiotherapy. Patients were treated in a stereotactic body frame and breathing motion was reduced by abdominal compression. The single doses used ranged between 19 and 30 Gy/isocenter. RESULTS: After a median follow-up period of 15 months (range, 1.5-72 months) the actuarial overall survival rates and disease-free survival rates were 74.5\%, 65.4\%, 37.4\%, and 70.2\%, 49.1\%, 49.1\% at 12, 24, and 36 months after therapy, respectively. The actuarial local tumor control rates were 89.5\%, 67.9\%, and 67.9\% at 12, 24, and 36 months after therapy, respectively. A significant difference (P = .032) in local tumor control was found for patients receiving 26-30 Gy (n = 32) compared with doses of less than 26 Gy (n = 10). The effect of the tumor volume on local tumor control was also evaluated. Although the difference was not statistically significant (P = .078), the subgroup of tumors with a tumor volume of less than 12 cm(3) (n = 10) experienced no tumor recurrence. Thirteen (31\%) patients developed metastases during follow-up, whereas isolated regional lymph node recurrence was only encountered in 2 patients. No clinically significant treatment-associated side effects were documented. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic single-dose radiotherapy is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with early stage NSCLC not suitable for surgery. Especially for small tumor volumes it seems to be equally effective as hypofractionated radiotherapy, while minimizing the overall treatment time",

abstract="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A simulation investigating the accuracy and reproducibility of a tumour motion prediction model over clinical time frames is presented. The model is formed from surrogate and tumour motion measurements, and used to predict the future position of the tumour from surrogate measurements alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were acquired from five non-small cell lung cancer patients, on 3 days. Measurements of respiratory volume by spirometry and abdominal displacement by a real-time position tracking system were acquired simultaneously with X-ray fluoroscopy measurements of superior-inferior tumour displacement. A model of tumour motion was established and used to predict future tumour position, based on surrogate input data. The calculated position was compared against true tumour motion as seen on fluoroscopy. Three different imaging strategies, pre-treatment, pre-fraction and intrafractional imaging, were employed in establishing the fitting parameters of the prediction model. The impact of each imaging strategy upon accuracy and reproducibility was quantified. RESULTS: When establishing the predictive model using pre-treatment imaging, four of five patients exhibited poor interfractional reproducibility for either surrogate in subsequent sessions. Simulating the formulation of the predictive model prior to each fraction resulted in improved interfractional reproducibility. The accuracy of the prediction model was only improved in one of five patients when intrafractional imaging was used. CONCLUSIONS: Employing a prediction model established from measurements acquired at planning resulted in localization errors. Pre-fractional imaging improved the accuracy and reproducibility of the prediction model. Intrafractional imaging was of less value, suggesting that the accuracy limit of a surrogate-based prediction model is reached with once-daily imaging",

The linear correlation coefficient was computed for each data acquisition. The phase relationship between the surrogate and tumor signals was estimated through cross-correlation delay analysis.Results: Correlation coefficients ranged from very high to very low (0.99-0.39, p Conclusions: Respiratory volume has a more reproducible correlation with tumor motion than does abdominal displacement. If forming a tumor-surrogate prediction model from a limited series of observations, the use of surrogates to guide treatment might result in geographic miss",

An analytical algorithm based on the generalized Fermi-Eyges theory is developed and used to calculate the effects of multiple scattering and range straggling on the dose distribution of light ion beams in water.

Nuclear reactions are not taken into account in this study. The analytical algorithm given in the present study allows an accurate description of the radial spread and the range straggling of light ions traversing matter.

abstract="The sharp lateral penumbra and the rapid fall-off of dose at the end of range of a proton beam are among the major advantages of proton radiation therapy. These beam characteristics depend on the position and characteristics of upstream beam-modifying devices such as apertures and compensating boluses. The extent of separation, if any, between these beam-modifying devices and the patient is particularly critical in this respect. We have developed a pencil beam algorithm for proton dose calculations which takes accurate account of the effects of materials upstream of the patient and of the air gap between them and the patient. The model includes a new approach to picking the locations of the pencil beams so as to more accurately model the penumbra and to more effectively account for the multiple-scattering effects of the media around the point of interest. We also present a faster broad-beam version of the algorithm which gives a reasonably accurate penumbra. Predictions of the algorithm and results from experiments performed in a large-field proton beam are presented. In general the algorithm agrees well with the measurements",

abstract="Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in the treatment of head-and-neck (H\&N) cancer provides the opportunity to diminish normal tissue toxicity profiles and thereby enhance patient quality of life. However, highly conformal treatment techniques commonly establish steep dose gradients between tumor and avoidance structures. Daily setup variations can therefore significantly compromise the ultimate precision of idealized H\&N IMRT delivery. This study provides a detailed analysis regarding the potential impact of daily setup variations on the overall integrity of H\&N IMRT.Methods and materialsA series of 10 patients with advanced H\&N cancer were prospectively enrolled in a clinical trial to examine daily H\&N radiation setup accuracy. These patients were treated with conventional shrinking field design using three-dimensional treatment planning techniques (not IMRT). Immobilization and alignment were performed using modern H\&N practice techniques including conventional thermoplastic masking, baseplate fixation to the treatment couch, three-point laser alignment, and weekly portal film evaluation. After traditional laser alignment, setup accuracy was assessed daily for each patient by measuring 3 Cartesian and 3 angular deviations from the specified isocenter using a high-precision, optically guided patient localization system, which affords submillimeter setup accuracy. These positional errors were then applied to a distinct series of 10 H\&N IMRT plans for detailed analysis regarding the impact of daily setup variation (without optical guidance) on the ultimate integrity of IMRT plans over a 30-day treatment course. Dose-volume histogram (DVH), equivalent uniform dose (EUD), mean total dose (mTd), and maximal total dose (MTD) for normal structures were analyzed for IMRT plans with and without incorporation of daily setup variation.ResultsUsing conventional H\&N masking and laser alignment for daily positioning, the mean setup error in any single dimension averaged 3.33 mm. However, when all six degrees of freedom were accounted for, using the optically guided patient localization system, the mean composite vector offset was 6.97 mm with a standard deviation of 3.63 mm. Superimposition of mean offset vectors on idealized H\&N IMRT treatment plans enabled evaluation of resultant shifts in DVH, EUD, mTd, and MTD calculations. Partial geographic tumor miss (GTV underdosing) and normal tissue overdosing was common when these mean positional offsets were incorporated. The decrease in EUD for defined tumor volumes ranged up to 21\% when the largest offset histories were applied, and 3-14\% for plans when the least and median offset histories were applied.ConclusionThe successful implementation of H\&N IMRT requires accurate and reproducible treatment delivery over a 6- to 7-week treatment course. The adverse impact of daily setup variation, which occurs routinely with conventional H\&N masking techniques, may be considerably greater than recognized. Isocenter verification checks on two-dimensional orthogonal films may not sufficiently alert the clinician to the magnitude of three-dimensional offset vectors and the resultant impact on the quality of overall IMRT delivery. Unrecognized geographic miss and resultant target underdose may occur. Similarly, selected normal structures such as parotid glands may receive higher doses than intended. The results of this study suggest that more rigorous immobilization techniques than conventional masking and routine patient setup tracking methodologies are important for the accurate monitoring and successful delivery of high-quality IMRT for H\&N cancer",

abstract="PURPOSE: To quantify the clinical accuracy of the respiratory motion tracking system of the CyberKnife treatment device. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Data in log files of 44 lung cancer patients treated with tumor tracking were analyzed. Errors in the correlation model, which relates the internal target motion with the external breathing motion, were quantified. The correlation model error was compared with the geometric error obtained when no respiratory tracking was used. Errors in the prediction method were calculated by subtracting the predicted position from the actual measured position after 192.5 ms (the time lag to prediction in our current system). The prediction error was also measured for a time lag of 115 ms and a new prediction method. RESULTS: The mean correlation model errors were less than 0.3 mm. Standard deviations describing intrafraction variations around the whole-fraction mean error were 0.2 to 1.9 mm for cranio-caudal, 0.1 to 1.9 mm for left-right, and 0.2 to 2.5 mm for anterior-posterior directions. Without the use of respiratory tracking, these variations would have been 0.2 to 8.1 mm, 0.2 to 5.5 mm, and 0.2 to 4.4 mm. The overall mean prediction error was small (0.0 +/- 0.0 mm) for all directions. The intrafraction standard deviation ranged from 0.0 to 2.9 mm for a time delay of 192.5 ms but was halved by using the new prediction method. CONCLUSIONS: Analyses of the log files of real clinical cases have shown that the geometric error caused by respiratory motion is substantially reduced by the application of respiratory motion tracking",

abstract="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The goal of this work is to develop and evaluate strategies to reduce the uncertainty in the prostate position and rectum shape that arises in the preparation stage of the radiation treatment of prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nineteen prostate cancer patients, who were treated with 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, received each a planning CT scan and 8-13 repeat CT scans during the treatment period. We quantified prostate motion relative to the pelvic bone by first matching the repeat CT scans on the planning CT scan using the bony anatomy. Subsequently, each contoured prostate, including seminal vesicles, was matched on the prostate in the planning CT scan to obtain the translations and rotations. The variation in prostate position was determined in terms of the systematic, random and group mean error. We tested the performance of two correction strategies to reduce the systematic error due to prostate motion. The first strategy, the pre-treatment strategy, used only the initial rectum volume in the planning CT scan to adjust the angle of the prostate with respect to the left-right (LR) axis and the shape and position of the rectum. The second strategy, the adaptive strategy, used the data of repeat CT scans to improve the estimate of the prostate position and rectum shape during the treatment. RESULTS: The largest component of prostate motion was a rotation around the LR axis. The systematic error (1 SD) was 5.1 degrees and the random error was 3.6 degrees (1 SD). The average LR-axis rotation between the planning and the repeat CT scans correlated significantly with the rectum volume in the planning CT scan (r=0.86, P<0.0001). Correction of the rotational position on the basis of the planning rectum volume alone reduced the systematic error by 28\%. A correction, based on the data of the planning CT scan and 4 repeat CT scans reduced the systematic error over the complete treatment period by a factor of 2. When the correction was carried out later in the treatment (based on the data of more scans) the overall reduction was less. For the rectum, the first strategy performed best at the upper anterior side, where a reduction of the anterior-posterior displacement of 30\% could be achieved. The systematic error could be reduced by 43\% for the whole rectum by using the data of 4 repeat CT scans and the planning CT scan. CONCLUSIONS: Both the pre-treatment as well as the adaptive correction strategy reduced the systematic error in the prostate position and rectum position and shape. A smaller systematic error makes it possible to safely reduce the margin around the clinical tumor volume, so that normal tissues can be spared or the prescription dose can be escalated",

abstract="We report on various algorithms used for the nonlinear optimization of RBE-weighted dose in particle therapy. Concerning the dose calculation carbon ions are considered and biological effects are calculated by the Local Effect Model. Taking biological effects fully into account requires iterative methods to solve the optimization problem. We implemented several additional algorithms into GSI's treatment planning system TRiP98, like the BFGS-algorithm and the method of conjugated gradients, in order to investigate their computational performance. We modified textbook iteration procedures to improve the convergence speed. The performance of the algorithms is presented by convergence in terms of iterations and computation time. We found that the Fletcher-Reeves variant of the method of conjugated gradients is the algorithm with the best computational performance. With this algorithm we could speed up computation times by a factor of 4 compared to the method of steepest descent, which was used before. With our new methods it is possible to optimize complex treatment plans in a few minutes leading to good dose distributions. At the end we discuss future goals concerning dose optimization issues in particle therapy which might benefit from fast optimization solvers",

abstract="PURPOSE: To quantify nonrespiratory organ motion in the pancreatic region and its effect on clinical target volume. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three-dimensional translations of the geometric centers of the volumes of interest--pancreatic head, body, and tail; left and right kidney; and the superior mesenteric artery--were measured in 20 patients by analyzing three spiral computed tomographic (CT) protocols performed at static exhalation and representing differential gastrointestinal distention. Wilcoxon test for paired differences was applied to determine statistical significance (P <.05). Spearman rank correlation coefficients were calculated between combinations of statistically significant translations. With the assumption that the organ positions were represented by a three-dimensional Gaussian distribution that occurs during treatment, clinical target volume expansions were calculated to account for organ motion and a typical setup error. RESULTS: Significant translations of the volume of interest were observed. The most mobile parts of the target organs were the pancreatic tail (P =.001) and the superior mesenteric artery (P =.01). Larger variations from the mean in the planning CT protocol in which negative contrast material was used usually resulted in a slightly larger clinical target volume expansion.

abstract="PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to establish the in vivo verification of proton beam path by using proton-activated positron emission distributions. METHODS: A total of 50 PET/CT imaging studies were performed on ten prostate cancer patients immediately after daily proton therapy treatment through a single lateral portal. The PET/CT and planning CT were registered by matching the pelvic bones, and the beam path of delivered protons was defined in vivo by the positron emission distribution seen only within the pelvic bones, referred to as the PET-defined beam path. Because of the patient position correction at each fraction, the marker-defined beam path, determined by the centroid of implanted markers seen in the posttreatment (post-Tx) CT, is used for the planned beam path. The angular variation and discordance between the PET- and marker-defined paths were derived to investigate the intrafraction prostate motion. For studies with large discordance, the relative location between the centroid and pelvic bones seen in the post-Tx CT was examined. The PET/CT studies are categorized for distinguishing the prostate motion that occurred before or after beam delivery. The post-PET CT was acquired after PET imaging to investigate prostate motion due to physiological changes during the extended PET acquisition. RESULTS: The less than 2 degrees of angular variation indicates that the patient roll was minimal within the immobilization device. Thirty of the 50 studies with small discordance, referred as good cases, show a consistent alignment between the field edges and the positron emission distributions from the entrance to the distal edge. For those good cases, average displacements are 0.6 and 1.3 mm along the anterior-posterior (D(AP)) and superior-inferior (D(SI)) directions, respectively, with 1.6 mm standard deviations in both directions. For the remaining 20 studies demonstrating a large discordance (more than 6 mm in either D(AP) or D(SI)), 13 studies, referred as motion-after-Tx cases, also show large misalignment between the field edge and the positron emission distribution in lipomatous tissues around the prostate. These motion-after-Tx cases correspond to patients with large changes in volume of rectal gas between the post-Tx and the post-PET CTs. The standard deviations for D(AP) and D(SI) are 5.0 and 3.0 mm, respectively, for these motion-after-Tx cases. The final seven studies, referred to as position-error cases, which had a large discordance but no misalignment, were found to have deviations of 4.6 and 3.6 mm in D(AP) and D(SI), respectively. The position-error cases correspond to a large discrepancy on the relative location between the centroid and pelvic bones seen in post-Tx CT and recorded x-ray radiographs. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic analyses of proton-activated positron emission distributions provide patient-specific information on prostate motion (sigmaM) and patient position variability (sigmap) during daily proton beam delivery. The less than 2 mm of displacement variations in the good cases indicates that population-based values of sigmap and sigmaM, used in margin algorithms for treatment planning at the authors' institution are valid for the majority of cases. However, a small fraction of PET/CT studies (approximately 14\%) with -4 mm displacement variations may require different margins. Such data are useful in establishing patient-specific planning target volume margins",

abstract="PURPOSE: Delivering high dose to prostate with external beam radiation has been shown to improve local tumor control. However, it has to be carefully performed to avoid partial target miss and delivering excessive dose to surrounding normal tissues. One way to achieve safe dose escalation is to precisely localize prostate immediately before daily treatment. Therefore, the radiation can be accurately delivered to the target. Once the prostate position is determined with high confidence, planning target volume (PTV) safety margin might be reduced for further reduction of rectal toxicity. A rapid computed tomography (CT)-based online prostate localization method is presented for this purpose. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Immediately before each treatment session, the patient is immobilized and undergoes a CT scan in the treatment position using a CT scanner situated in the treatment room. At the CT console, posterior, anterior, left, and right extents of the prostate are manually identified on each axial slice. The translational prostate displacements relative to the planned position are estimated by simultaneously fitting these identified extents from this CT scan to a template created from the finely sliced planning CT scan. A total of 106 serial CT scans from 8 prostate cancer patients were performed immediately before treatments and used to retrospectively evaluate the precision of this daily prostate targeting method. The three-dimensional displacement of the prostate with respect to its planned position was estimated. RESULTS: Five axial slices from each treatment CT scan were sufficient to produce a reliable correction when compared with prostate center of gravity (CoG) displacements calculated from physician-drawn contours. The differences (mean +/- SD) between these two correction schemes in the right-left (R/L), posterior-anterior (P/A), and superior-inferior (S/I) directions are 0.0 +/- 0.4 mm, 0.0 +/- 0.7 mm, and -0.4 +/- 1.9 mm, respectively. With daily CT extent-fitting correction, 97\% of the scans showed that the entire posterior prostate gland was covered by PTV given a margin of 6 mm at the rectum-prostate interface and 10 mm elsewhere. In comparison, only 74\% and 65\% could be achieved by the corrections based on daily and weekly bony matching on portal images, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Results show that daily CT extent fitting provides a precise correction of prostate position in terms of CoG. Identifying prostate extents on five axial CT slices at the CT console is less time-consuming compared with daily contouring of the prostate on many slices. Taking advantage of the prostate curvature in the longitudinal direction, this method also eliminates the necessity of identifying prostate base and apex. Therefore, it is clinically feasible and should provide an accelerated localization of the prostate immediately before daily treatment",

abstract="PURPOSE: Although the interfraction motion of the prostate has been previously studied through the use of fiducial markers, CT scans, and ultrasound-based systems, intrafraction motion is not well documented. In this report, the B-mode, Acquisition, and Targeting (BAT) ultrasound system was used to measure intrafraction prostate motion during 200 intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) sessions for prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty men receiving treatment with IMRT for clinically localized prostate cancer were selected for the study. Pre- and posttreatment BAT ultrasound alignment images were collected immediately before and after IMRT on 10 treatment days for a total of 400 BAT alignment procedures. Any ultrasound shifts of the prostate borders in relation to the planning CT scan were recorded in 3 dimensions: right-left (RL), anteroposterior (AP), and superior-inferior (SI). Every ultrasound procedure was evaluated for image quality and alignment according to a 3-point grading scale. RESULTS: All the BAT images were judged to be of acceptable quality and alignment. The dominant directions of intrafraction prostate motion were anteriorly and superiorly. The mean magnitude of shifts (+/-SD) was 0.01 +/- 0.4 mm, 0.2 +/- 1.3 mm, and 0.1 +/- 1.0 mm in the left, anterior, and superior directions, respectively. The maximal range of motion occurred in the AP dimension, from 6.8 mm anteriorly to 4.6 mm posteriorly. The percentage of treatments during which prostate motion was judged to be <or=5 mm was 100\%, 99\%, and 99.5\% in the RL, AP, and SI directions, respectively. Three of the measurements were >5 mm. The extent of intrafraction motion was much smaller than that of interfraction motion. Linear regression analysis showed very little correlation between the two types of motion (r = 0.014, 0.029, and 0.191, respectively) in the RL, AP, and SI directions. CONCLUSION: Using an ultrasound-based system, intrafraction prostate motion occurred predominantly in the anterior and superior directions, but was clinically insignificant. Intrafraction motion was much smaller than interfraction motion, and the two types of movement did not correlate",

abstract="PURPOSE: To identify dosimetric, anatomic, and clinical factors that correlate with late rectal toxicity after three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively analyzed the dose-volume histograms and clinical records of 163 Stage T1b-T3c prostate cancer patients treated between 1992 and 1999 with 3D-CRT, to a total isocenter dose of 74-78 Gy at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. The median follow-up was 62 months (range 24-102). All late rectal complications were scored using modified Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and Late Effects Normal Tissue Task Force criteria. The 6-year toxicity rate was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test. A univariate proportional hazards regression model was used to test the correlation between Grade 2 or higher toxicity and the dosimetric, anatomic, and clinical factors. In a multivariate regression model, clinical factors were added to the dosimetric and anatomic variables to determine whether they significantly altered the risk of developing late toxicity. RESULTS: At 6 years, the rate of developing Grade 2 or higher late rectal toxicity was 25\%. A significant volume effect was observed at rectal doses of 60, 70, 75.6, and 78 Gy, and the risk of developing rectal complications increased exponentially as greater volumes were irradiated. Although the percentage of rectal volume treated correlated significantly with the incidence of rectal complications at all dose levels (p <0.0001 for all comparisons), the absolute rectal volume appeared to be a factor only at the higher doses of 70, 75.6, and 78 Gy (p = 0.0514, 0.0016, and 0.0021, respectively). The following variables also correlated with toxicity on the univariate analysis: maximal dose to the clinical target volume, maximal dose to rectum, maximal dose to the rectum as a percentage of the prescribed dose, and maximal dose delivered to 10 cm(3) of the rectum. Of the clinical variables tested, only a history of hemorrhoids correlated with rectal toxicity (p = 0.003). Multivariate analysis showed that the addition of hemorrhoids increased the risk of toxicity for each dosimetric variable found to be significant on univariate analysis (p <0.05 for all comparisons). CONCLUSION: Dose-volume histogram analyses clearly indicated a volume effect on the probability of developing late rectal complications. Therefore, dose escalation may be safely achieved by adherence to dose-volume histogram constraints during treatment planning and organ localization at the time of treatment to ensure consistent patient setup",

The ideal fiducial marker is clearly visible in kV imaging, does not perturb the therapeutic dose in the target volume and does not cause any artifacts on the CT images used for treatment planning. As yet, ideal markers that fully meet all three of these criteria have not been reported. In this study, 12 fiducial markers were evaluated for their potential clinical utility in proton radiation therapy for prostate cancer. In order to identify the good candidates, each fiducial was imaged using a CT scanner as well as a kV imaging system. Additionally, the dose perturbation caused by each fiducial was quantified using radiochromic film and a clinical proton beam. Based on the results, three fiducials were identified as good candidates for use in proton radiotherapy of prostate cancer",

abstract="BACKGROUND: In selected patients with NSCLC the therapeutic index of radical radiotherapy can be improved with gating/tracking technology. Both techniques require real-time information on target location. This is often derived from a surrogate ventilatory signal. We assessed the correlation of two novel surrogate ventilatory signals with a spirometer-derived signal. The novel signals were obtained using the VisionRT stereoscopic camera system. The VisionRT-Tracked-Point (VRT-TP) signal was derived from tracking a point located midway between the umbilicus and xiphisternum. The VisionRT-Surface-Derived-Volume (VRT-SDV) signal was derived from 3D body surface imaging of the torso. Both have potential advantages over the current surrogate signals. METHODS: Eleven subjects with NSCLC were recruited. Each was positioned as for radiotherapy treatment, and then instructed to breathe in five different modes: normal, abdominal, thoracic, deep and shallow breathing. Synchronous ventilatory signals were recorded for later analysis. The signals were analysed for correlation across all modes of breathing, and phase shifts. The VRT-SDV was also assessed for its ability to determine the mode of breathing. RESULTS: Both novel respiratory signals showed good correlation (r>0.80) with spirometry in 9 of 11 subjects. For all subjects the correlation with spirometry was better for the VRT-SDV signal than for the VRT-TP signal. Only one subject displayed a phase shift between the VisionRT-derived signals and spirometry. The VRT-SDV signal could also differentiate between different modes of breathing. Unlike the spirometer-derived signal, neither VisionRT-derived signal was subject to drift. CONCLUSION: Both the VRT-TP and VRT-SDV signals have potential applications in ventilatory-gated and tracked radiotherapy. They can also be used as a signal for sorting 4DCT images, and to drive 4DCT single- and multiple-parameter motion models",

abstract="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To quantify changes in patients' diaphragm motion pattern over the course of radiotherapy and to evaluate the implications of these changes for 4D radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2004 to October 2004, 10 patients with lung malignancies treated at our department underwent weekly respiratory motion verification during the course of external beam radiation. An onboard kilovoltage imaging system was used to acquire fluoroscopy weekly for patients with lung neoplasms. The diaphragm position as a function of time was extracted automatically from the fluoroscopy and used to calculate the daily mean and daily SD of motion. The diaphragm position was related to both a bony reference point and machine isocenter. Changes in the daily mean and daily SD in relation to the reference (first day) daily mean and reference daily SD were measured. RESULTS: The mean change in the daily mean was 0.32 mm+/-6.11 mm in relation to the bony reference point and 0.38 mm+/-6.28 mm in relation to isocenter. The mean change in the daily SD was 0.91 mm+/-1.81 mm. The mean systematic change in the daily mean was 4.97 mm, and the mean random change in the daily mean was 3.61 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Daily verification of 4D radiotherapy techniques to assess the necessity of online set-up correction may be required due to the large change in the mean diaphragm position observed for these patients. However, the variation of the daily SD was small for most patients. Adaptive adjustment of the margin may be necessary for those patients with larger variation of the daily SD",

abstract="PURPOSE: Proton doses are sensitive to intra- and interfractional anatomic changes. We analyzed the effects of interfractional anatomic changes in doses to lung tumors treated with proton therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Weekly four-dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT) scans were acquired for 8 patients with mobile Stage III non-small cell lung cancer who were actually treated with intensity-modulated photon radiotherapy. A conformal proton therapy passive scattering plan was designed for each patient. Dose distributions were recalculated at end-inspiration and end-expiration breathing phases on each weekly 4D-CT data set using the same plans with alignment based on bone registration. RESULTS: Clinical target volume (CTV) coverage was compromised (from 99\% to 90.9\%) in 1 patient because of anatomic changes and motion pattern variation. For the rest of the patients, the mean CTV coverage on the repeated weekly 4D-CT data sets was 98.4\%, compared with 99\% for the original plans. For all 8 patients, however, a mean 4\% increase in the volume of the contralateral lung receiving a dose of at least 5 Gy (V5) and a mean 4.4-Gy increase in the spinal cord maximum dose was observed in the repeated 4D-CT data sets. A strong correlation between the CTV density change resulting from tumor shrinkage or anatomic variations and mean contralateral lung dose was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptive re-planning during proton therapy may be indicated in selected patients with non-small cell lung cancer. For most patients, however, CTV coverage is adequate if tumor motion is taken into consideration in the original simulation and planning processes",

abstract="The management of primary lung cancer relies on sophisticated imaging methods to assist in the diagnosis, staging, and evaluation of tumor regression during treatment. The information provided is generally anatomical in nature, except for that provided by positron emission tomography with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose, a modality that yields physiological data that have been shown to be useful in identifying neoplasia, based on an elevated glucose metabolic rate. Because the metabolism of malignant tissue depends intimately on neovascularization to provide oxygen and glucose in sufficient quantities to allow tumor growth, the characterization of tumor vascular physiology could be an important tool for assessing and predicting the likely effectiveness of treatment. Our goal was to show the feasibility and practical value of parameters of tumor vascular physiology obtained using dynamic T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to correlate them with glucose metabolism and to demonstrate changes in these parameters during and after treatment in patients with lung cancer. Parameters of vascular physiology [permeability-surface area (PS) product and extracellular contrast agent distribution volume] and glucose metabolism were assessed in 14 patients with lung cancer. Glucose metabolism was measured by using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. Vascular physiology was assessed by dynamic T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced MRI. The mean PS product in tumor was 0.0015 +/- 0.0002 s(-1) (n = 13) before, 0.0023 +/- 0.0003 s(-1) (n = 3, P = 0.053) midway through, and 0.00075 +/- 0.0002 s(-1) (n = 5, P < 0.03) 2 weeks after treatment. Values for the extracellular contrast distribution space were 0.321 +/- 0.03 before, 0.289 +/- 0.02 midway through, and 0.195 +/- 0.02 (P < 0.01) 2 weeks after therapy. The glucose metabolic rate was significantly correlated with the PS product (P < 0.01) but not with the extracellular contrast distribution space. Our results demonstrate that tumor PS product correlates with glucose metabolism, that chemo- and radiotherapy induce observable and quantifiable changes in these parameters, and that such changes can be measured by in vivo dynamic MRI. Quantitative dynamic T1-weighted MRI of tumor vascular physiology may have a useful role in the clinical management of lung cancer",

The fixation rate of the markers using the bronchial insertion technique, reliability of the setup using markers around the target volume, dislocation of the markers after real-time tumor-tracking RT, and long-term toxicity of marker insertion were investigated.Methods and MaterialsBetween July 2000 and April 2004, 154 gold markers were inserted into 57 patients with peripheral lung cancer. The distances between the implanted markers in 198 measurements in 71 setups in 11 patients were measured using two sets of orthogonal diagnostic X-ray images of the real-time tumor-tracking RT system. The distance between the markers and the chest wall was also measured in a transaxial CT image on 186 occasions in 48 patients during treatment planning and during follow-up. The median treatment time was 6 days (range, 4-14 days).ResultsIn 115 (75\%) of the 154 inserted markers, the gold marker was detected throughout the treatment period. In 122 markers detected at CT planning, 115 (94\%) were detected until the end of treatment. The variation in the distances between the implanted markers was within {\backslash}pm2 mm in 95\% and {\backslash}pm1 mm in 80\% during treatment. The variation in the distances between the implanted markers was >2 mm in at least one direction in 9\% of the setups for which reexamination with a CT scan was indicated. The fixation rate in the left upper lobe was lower than in the other lobes. A statistically significant relationship was found between a shorter distance between the markers and the chest wall and the fixation rate, suggesting that the markers in the smaller bronchial lumens fixed better than those in the larger lumens. A learning curve among the endoscopists was suggested in the fixation rate. The distance between the markers and the chest wall changed significantly within a median of 44 days (range, 16-181 days) after treatment.ConclusionThe fixation of markers into the bronchial tree was useful for the setup for peripheral lung cancer and had an accuracy of {\backslash}pm2 mm during the 1-2-week treatment period. The relationship between the markers and tumor can change significantly after 2 weeks, suggesting that adaptive four-dimensional RT is required",

abstract="In radiation therapy with highly energetic heavy ions, the conformal irradiation of a tumour can be achieved by using their advantageous features such as the good dose localization and the high relative biological effectiveness around their mean range. For effective utilization of such properties, it is necessary to evaluate the range of incident ions and the deposited dose distribution in a patient's body. Several methods have been proposed to derive such physical quantities; one of them uses positron emitters generated through projectile fragmentation reactions of incident ions with target nuclei. We have proposed the application of the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method to a detected annihilation gamma-ray distribution for determination of the range of incident ions in a target and we have demonstrated the effectiveness of the method with computer simulations. In this paper, a water, a polyethylene and a polymethyl methacrylate target were each irradiated with stable (12)C, (14)N, (16)O and (20)Ne beams. Except for a few combinations of incident beams and targets, the MLE method could determine the range of incident ions R(MLE) with a difference between R(MLE) and the experimental range of less than 2.0 mm under the circumstance that the measurement of annihilation gamma rays was started just after the irradiation of 61.4 s and lasted for 500 s. In the process of evaluating the range of incident ions with the MLE method, we must calculate many physical quantities such as the fluence and the energy of both primary ions and fragments as a function of depth in a target. Consequently, by using them we can obtain the dose distribution. Thus, when the mean range of incident ions is determined with the MLE method, the annihilation gamma-ray distribution and the deposited dose distribution can be derived simultaneously. The derived dose distributions in water for the mono-energetic heavy-ion beams of four species were compared with those measured with an ionization chamber. The good agreement between the derived and the measured distributions implies that the deposited dose distribution in a target can be estimated from the detected annihilation gamma-ray distribution with a positron camera",

abstract="In three-dimensional irradiation with pencil beam scanning, an extra dose is inevitably delivered to the irradiated site due to the finite reaction times of the beam delivery system, and it causes a severe distortion of the dose distribution in the target region. Since the amount of the extra dose is proportional to the beam intensity, the dose uniformity deteriorates as the beam intensity is increased in order to shorten the treatment time. In order to overcome this problem and shorten the treatment time, we have developed an optimization method in which the extra dose is integrated into the optimization process of the best weighting matrix. The effectiveness and applicability of the optimization method for spot and raster scanning irradiation were confirmed with computer simulations and also confirmed using irradiation experiments for spot scanning irradiation. The treatment time could be shortened to about one sixth of the time needed without taking the extra dose into account while obtaining the same degree of dose homogeneity in the target volume. A typical treatment time with the proposed method is about 15 s for the irradiation of a spherical target with an 80 mm diameter at 3 GyE",

abstract="In order to effectively utilize the prominent properties of heavy ions in radiotherapy, it is important to evaluate both the position of the field irradiated with incident ions and the absorbed dose distribution in a patient's body. One of the methods for this purpose is the utilization of the positron emitters produced through the projectile fragmentation reactions of stable heavy ions with target nuclei. In heavy-ion therapy, spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) beams are used to achieve uniform biological dose distributions in the whole tumor volume. Therefore, in this study, we designed SOBP beams of 30 and 50 mm water-equivalent length (mmWEL) in width for (12)C and (16)O, and carried out irradiation experiments using them. Water, polyethylene and polymethyl methacrylate were selected as targets to simulate a human body. Pairs of annihilation gamma rays were detected by means of a limited-angle positron camera for 500 s, and annihilation gamma-ray distributions were obtained. The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method was applied to the detected distributions for evaluating the positions of the distal and proximal edges of the SOBP in a target. The differences between the positions evaluated with the MLE method and those derived from the measured dose distributions were less than 1.7 mm and 2.5 mm for the distal and the proximal edge, respectively, in all irradiation conditions. When the positions of both edges are determined with the MLE method, the most probable shape of the dose distribution in a target can be estimated simultaneously. The close agreement between the estimated and the measured distributions implied that the shape of the dose distribution in an irradiated target could be evaluated from the detected annihilation gamma-ray distribution",

In addition, we show the procedure for integrating the modified MKM into a treatment planning system for a scanned carbon beam. With this procedure, the model is fully integrated into our research version of the treatment planning system. To account for the change in radiosensitivity of a cell line, we measured one of the three MKM parameters from a single survival curve of the current cells and used the parameter in biological optimization. Irradiation of human salivary gland tumor cells was performed with a scanned carbon beam in the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC), and we then compared the measured depth-survival curve with the modified MKM predicted survival curve. Good agreement between the two curves proves that the proposed method is a candidate for calculating the biological effects in treatment planning for ion irradiation",

abstract="In gated radiation therapy procedures, the lung tumor position is used directly (by implanted radiopaque markers) or indirectly (by external surrogate methods) to decrease the volume of irradiated healthy tissue. Due to a risk of pneumothorax, many clinics do not implant fiducials, and the gated treatment is primarily based on a respiratory induced external signal. The external surrogate method relies upon the assumption that the internal tumor motion is well correlated with the external respiratory induced motion, and that this correlation is constant in time. Using a set of data that contains synchronous internal and external motion traces, we have developed a dynamic data analysis technique to study the internal-external correlation, and to quantitatively estimate its underlying time behavior. The work presented here quantifies the time dependent behavior of the correlation between external respiratory signals and lung implanted fiducial motion. The corresponding amplitude mismatch is also reported for the lung patients studied. The information obtained can be used to improve the accuracy of tumor tracking. For the ten patients in this study, the SI internal-external motion is well correlated, with small time shifts and corresponding amplitude mismatches. Although the AP internal-external motion reveals larger time shifts than along the SI direction, the corresponding amplitude mismatches are below 5 mm",

abstract="PURPOSE: To compare hyperpolarized helium-3 magnetic resonance imaging ((3)He-MRI) acquired from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients before and after external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: In an Ethics Committee-approved prospective study, five patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC gave written informed consent to undergo computed tomography (CT) and (3)He-MR ventilation imaging 1 week prior to and 3 months after radiotherapy. Images were registered to pre-treatment CT using anatomical landmark-based rigid registration to enable comparison. Emphysema was graded from examination of the CT. MRI-defined ventilation was calculated as the intersection of (3)He-MRI and CT lung volume as a percentage of the CT lung volume for the whole lung and regions of CT-defined pneumonitis. RESULTS: On pre-treatment images, there was a significant correlation between the degree of CT-defined emphysema and (3)He-MRI whole lung ventilation (Spearman's rho=0.90, p=0.04). After radiation therapy, pneumonitis was evident on CT for 3/5 patients. For these cases, (3)He-MRI ventilation was significantly reduced within the regions of pneumonitis (pre: 94.1+/-2.2\%, post: 73.7+/-4.7\%; matched pairs Student's t-test, p=0.02, mean difference=20.4\%, 95\% confidence interval 6.3-34.6\%). CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates the feasibility of detecting ventilation changes between pre- and post-treatment using hyperpolarized helium-3 MRI for patients with NSCLC. Pre-treatment, the degree of emphysema and (3)He-MRI ventilation were correlated. For three cases of radiation pneumonitis, (3)He-MRI ventilation changes between pre- and post-treatment imaging were consistent with CT evidence of radiation-induced lung injury",

abstract="It is desirable to reduce range ambiguities in treatment planning for making full use of the major advantage of heavy-ion radiotherapy, that is, good dose localization. A range verification system using positron emitting beams has been developed to verify the ranges in patients directly. The performance of the system was evaluated in beam experiments to confirm the designed properties. It was shown that a 10C beam could be used as a probing beam for range verification when measuring beam properties. Parametric measurements indicated the beam size and the momentum acceptance and the target volume did not influence range verification significantly. It was found that the range could be measured within an analysis uncertainty of +/-0.3 mm under the condition of 2.7 x 10(5) particle irradiation, corresponding to a peak dose of 96 mGyE (gray-equivalent dose), in a 150 mm diameter spherical polymethyl methacrylate phantom which simulated a human head",

abstract="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy and feasibility of carbon ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) for prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 2000 and November 2003, 175 patients received C-ion RT using a recommended dose fractionation (66.0 GyE/20 fractions) established from prior studies. C-ion RT alone was performed for 33 patients constituting a low-risk group (Stage < or =T2a and PSA <20 ng/ml and Gleason score < or =6); the remaining 142 high-risk patients received an additional androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). RESULTS: The 4-year overall survival and bNED rates were 91\% and 87\%, respectively. Local control was achieved in all but one patient. The 4-year bNED rates were 87\% in the low-risk group and 88\% in the high-risk group. In very advanced diseases (Stage > or= T3a or PSA > or= 20 ng/ml or Gleason score > or =8), there was significant difference in the bNED rate according to period of ADT administration (ADT > or =24 months: 93\%, ADT <24 months: 73\%, p<0.01). Grade 2 late toxicities developed in 4 patients (2\%) for the rectum and 9 patients (5\%) for the genitourinary system but no Grade 3 or higher toxicity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of C-ion RT for prostate cancer has been well confirmed. Based on these results, new study of a C-ion RT modified for the administration strategy of ADT according to the patient risk has been started by dividing patients into 3 groups, high-risk, intermediate-risk, and low-risk",

abstract="BACKGROUND: A study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical outcome of particle therapy for stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: From April 2003 to April 2007, 80 patients with stage I NSCLC were treated with proton therapy or carbon-ion therapy (57 with proton therapy and 23 with carbon-ion therapy) using 3 treatment protocols. In the first protocol, 80 gray equivalents (GyE) of proton therapy was given in 20 fractions, and the second proton therapy protocol used 60 GyE in 10 fractions. For carbon-ion therapy, 52.8 GyE was given in 4 fractions. After achieving promising preliminary results for the first protocol, the authors started to use the second proton therapy protocol to shorten the overall treatment time. Carbon-ion therapy was started in 2005, and thereafter, both proton and carbon-ion therapy plans were made for each patient, and the 1 that appeared superior was adopted. Patient age ranged from 48 to 89 years (median, 76 years). Thirty-seven patients were medically inoperable, and 43 refused surgery. Forty-two patients had T1 tumors, and 38 had T2 tumors. RESULTS: The median follow-up period for living patients was 35.5 months. For all 80 patients, the 3-year overall survival, cause-specific survival, and local control rates were 75\% (IA: 74\%; IB: 76\%), 86\% (IA: 84\%; IB: 88\%), and 82\% (IA: 87\%; IB: 77\%), respectively. There were no significant differences in treatment results among the 3 protocols. Grade 3 pulmonary toxicity was observed in only 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy and carbon-ion therapy are safe and effective for stage I NSCLC. Further investigation of particle therapy for stage I NSCLC is warranted",

abstract="PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE: Late rectal bleeding is a potentially dose limiting complication of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for prostate cancer. The frequency of late rectal bleeding has been shown to increase as the prescription dose rises above 70 Gy. The purpose of this study is to identify features of the cumulative dose-volume histogram (DVH) for the rectal wall that correlate with late rectal bleeding after 3D-CRT for prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Follow-up information on rectal bleeding is available for 261 and 315 patients treated using 3D-CRT at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center for Stage T1c-T3 prostate cancer with minimum target doses of 70.2 and 75.6 Gy, respectively. All patients in this study were treated with a coplanar 6-field technique (2 lateral and 4 oblique fields). Patients were classified as having rectal bleeding if they bled (> or = Grade 2) before 30 months, and nonbleeding (< or = Grade 1) if they were without bleeding at 30 months, using the RTOG morbidity scale. Rectal bleeding was observed in 13 and 38 of the patients treated at 70.2 and 75.6 Gy, respectively. Treatment plans were analyzed for 39 nonbleeding and 13 bleeding patients receiving 70.2 Gy, and 83 nonbleeding and 36 bleeding patients receiving 75.6 Gy. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for the anatomic rectal wall were calculated. Average DVHs of the bleeding and nonbleeding patients were generated, and a permutation test was used to assess the significance of differences between them, for each dose group. The confounding effect of total rectal wall volume (V(RW)) was removed by calculating the average differences in DVHs between all combinations of bleeding and nonbleeding patients with similar V(RW)s. Finally, multivariate analysis using logistic regression was performed to test the significance of the DVH variables in the presence of anatomic, geometric, and medical variables previously found to correlate with rectal bleeding in a companion analysis of the same patients. RESULTS: The area under the average percent volume DVH for the rectal wall of patients with bleeding was significantly higher than those of patients without bleeding in both dose groups (p = 0.02, 70.2 Gy; p < 0.0001, 75.6 Gy). However, small V(RW)s were associated with rectal bleeding (p = 0.06, 70.2 Gy; p < 0.01, 75.6 Gy), resulting in an increase in average percent volumes exposed to all doses for patients with rectal bleeding. For patients with similar V(RW)s, rectal bleeding was significantly correlated with the volumes exposed to 46 Gy in both dose groups (p = 0.02, 70.2 Gy; p = 0.005, 75.6 Gy, tolerance in V(RW): 5 ccs). For the 75.6 Gy dose group, the percent volume receiving 77 Gy was significantly correlated with rectal bleeding (p < 0.005). Bivariate analysis using logistic regression, including V(RW) together with a single DVH variable, showed good agreement with the above analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed a borderline significant correlation of the percent volume receiving 71 Gy in the 70.2 Gy dose group. It also showed that the DVH variables were highly correlated with geometric and dosimetric variables previously found to correlate with rectal bleeding in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Significant volume effects were found in the probability of late rectal bleeding for patients undergoing 3D-CRT for prostate cancer with prescription doses of 70.2 and 75.6 Gy. The percent volumes exposed to 71 and 77 Gy in the 70.2 and 75.6 Gy dose groups respectively were significantly correlated with rectal bleeding. The independent correlation of small V(RW) with rectal bleeding may indicate the existence of a functional reserve for the rectum. The independent association with larger percent volumes exposed to intermediate doses ( approximately 46 Gy) seen in both dose groups may indicate that a large surrounding region of intermediate dose may interfere with the ability to repair the effects of a central high dose region",

abstract="PURPOSE: Respiratory motion must be accounted for daily in order to permit optimum radiotherapy of hepatic malignancies. However, existing tracking systems are often invasive or poorly tolerated by patients. The authors describe the development and validation of an ultrasound-guided tracking and gating system for stereotactic body radiation therapy of the liver. METHODS: This noninvasive system is designed to determine the correlation between tumor and external fiducial motion and to verify the optimum gating level for treatment delivery daily. A tracked ultrasound probe moves with patient respiration, obtaining 2D ultrasound images of tumor motion throughout the respiratory cycle. The target volume is registered to the static radiotherapy treatment beams in order to verify optimum gating levels. These gating levels are then transferred to an existing gating system for treatment delivery. The authors examined the temporal and spatial accuracy of this system using a custom-built phantom and verified the accuracy of gating level transfer and delivery. RESULTS: The temporal accuracy of the ultrasound-guided system was shown to be comparable to the existing clinical x-ray imaging system. Using ultrasound rather than x-rays to image internal targets provides good soft-tissue contrast without the invasiveness of implanting fiducial markers. High frame rates enable continuous monitoring of the target throughout the respiratory cycle. The authors anticipate this passive monitoring system should be well tolerated by patients. CONCLUSIONS: The system developed provides good quality video of the laboratory motion phantom and can be successfully used in gated beam delivery",

The system works by acquiring a 3D image set just prior to treatment delivery. This image set is matched automatically with bones and prostate defined in the planning CT to determine the required couch translation and to determine a best fitting treatment plan which is subsequently delivered. Because of the improved localization of the prostate on the treatment machine, potentially smaller safety margins can be applied and a higher dose can be delivered leading to a higher cure rate without increasing damage to healthy tissues",

abstract=": Geometric uncertainties in the process of radiation planning and delivery constrain dose escalation and induce normal tissue complications. An imaging system has been developed to generate high-resolution, soft-tissue images of the patient at the time of treatment for the purpose of guiding therapy and reducing such uncertainties. The performance of the imaging system is evaluated and the application to image-guided radiation therapy is discussed. : A kilovoltage imaging system capable of radiography, fluoroscopy, and cone-beam computed tomography (CT) has been integrated with a medical linear accelerator. Kilovoltage X-rays are generated by a conventional X-ray tube mounted on a retractable arm at 90[degree sign] to the treatment source. A 41 x 41 cm2 flat-panel X-ray detector is mounted opposite the kV tube. The entire imaging system operates under computer control, with a single application providing calibration, image acquisition, processing, and cone-beam CT reconstruction. Cone-beam CT imaging involves acquiring multiple kV radiographs as the gantry rotates through 360[degree sign] of rotation. A filtered back-projection algorithm is employed to reconstruct the volumetric images. Geometric nonidealities in the rotation of the gantry system are measured and corrected during reconstruction. Qualitative evaluation of imaging performance is performed using an anthropomorphic head phantom and a coronal contrast phantom. The influence of geometric nonidealities is examined. : Images of the head phantom were acquired and illustrate the submillimeter spatial resolution that is achieved with the cone-beam approach. High-resolution sagittal and coronal views demonstrate nearly isotropic spatial resolution. Flex corrections on the order of 0.2 cm were required to compensate gravity-induced flex in the support arms of the source and detector, as well as slight axial movements of the entire gantry structure. Images reconstructed without flex correction suffered from loss of detail, misregistration, and streak artifacts. Reconstructions of the contrast phantom demonstrate the soft-tissue imaging capability of the system. A contrast of 47 Hounsfield units was easily detected in a 0.1-cm-thick reconstruction for an imaging exposure of 1.2 R (in-air, in absence of phantom). The comparison with a conventional CT scan of the phantom further demonstrates the spatial resolution advantages of the cone-beam CT approach. : A kV cone-beam CT imaging system based on a large-area, flat-panel detector has been successfully adapted to a medical linear accelerator. The system is capable of producing images of soft tissue with excellent spatial resolution at acceptable imaging doses. Integration of this technology with the medical accelerator will result in an ideal platform for high-precision, image-guided radiation therapy",

abstract="Radiotherapy is one of the main treatment modalities in lung cancer, contributing to both its cure and palliation. Thoracic irradiation has traditionally been considered the mainstay of treatment in inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer. However, despite technical developments and the addition of chemotherapy, the curative potential of radiotherapy in this subset of patients is disappointingly poor. The role of radiotherapy as an adjunct to pulmonary resection (preoperative and postoperative) is questionable, but well-designed and executed phase III studies are lacking. An important application of radiotherapy is palliation of tumor-related symptoms in the chest and in metastatic sites, such as bones and brain. In small cell lung cancer, routine applications of radiotherapy include chest radiotherapy in limited disease and prophylactic cranial irradiation in complete responders to chemotherapy, each increasing survival by about 5\%",

The quality assurance program addresses acceptance and constancy tests of the treatment planning program. Results of the acceptance tests served as a basis for its governmental approval. Two main results of the acceptance tests are representative for the overall performance of the system. (1) The geometrical uncertainty that could be achieved for the target point definition, setup accuracy, field contouring, and field alignment is typically 1.5 mm. The uncertainty for the setup verification using digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR's) is limited to 2 mm. (2) The mean deviations between measured and planned dose values is 3\% for standardized cases in a water phantom and up to 6\% for more complicated treatment configurations",

abstract="The geometrical treatment configuration for skull base tumours is investigated using three different sources of information. First, an analysis of treatment angle combinations for 50 patients treated with conventional conformal radiation therapy is performed. In a second step, nine treatment plans for a hypothetical heavy ion gantry were prepared. Finally, cylindrical projections of the organs at risk are introduced as a tool to analyse the distribution of treatment angles as well as the treatment geometry for each patient. The results of the analysis for conventional therapy clearly show treatment angle combinations that are preferably used. These findings are also supported by the geometrical analysis using the cylindrical projections. The majority of treatment angles for heavy ions also seem to be confined to those regions. In one case, however, the sharp distal dose fall-off of the heavy ions allowed a beam direction outside these conventionally used regions. The advantages of a heavy ion gantry versus a fixed horizontal beam line are shown by comparison of treatment plans for both systems. Treatment angle combinations are suggested that should be accessible for any beam line design using either fixed beams or a gantry",

abstract="Cylindrical ionization chambers are used for the determination of absorbed dose in beams of heavy charged particles, where the effective point of measurement, Peff (the point in depth to which the measured dose refers), is a priori not known. A measurement of Peff for a Farmer-type chamber in a carbon ion beam is presented. It is based on a comparison of relative depth dose curves measured with a cylindrical chamber and a plane-parallel Markus chamber. Both measurements were compared against another high-precision relative depth dose measurement using large-area plane-parallel chambers. For Peff, a value of 72 +/- 7\% of the inner radius of the chamber is obtained. The relative depth dose curve for the cylindrical chamber is calculated using an averaging of the depth dose values over the curved inner surface of the active volume while taking account of the different depths of points on the inner surface. Within the measurement uncertainty of 0.2 mm the measurements agree well with the calculated Bragg curve for the Farmer chamber. The result for Peff is in correspondence with the value suggested in a new code of practice by the IAEA for protons and ions, and somewhat less than that suggested by Palmans for protons. The measurements show that cylindrical chambers are in general well suited for depth dose measurements in fields of heavy charged particles if the correct Peff is used",

abstract="The clinical implementation and application of a novel treatment planning system (TPS) for scanned ion beams is described, which is in clinical use for carbon ion treatments at the German heavy ion facility (GSI). All treatment plans are evaluated on the basis of biologically effective dose distributions. For therapy control, in-beam positron emission tomography (PET) and an online monitoring system for the beam intensity and position are used. The absence of a gantry restricts the treatment plans to horizontal beams. Most of the treatment plans consist of two nearly opposing lateral fields or sometimes orthogonal fields. In only a very few cases a single beam was used. For patients with very complex target volumes lateral and even distal field patching techniques were applied. Additional improvements can be achieved when the patient's head is fixed in a tilted position, in order to achieve sparing of the organs at risk. In order to test the stability of dose distributions in the case of patient misalignments we routinely simulate the effects of misalignments for patients with critical structures next to the target volume. The uncertainties in the range calculation are taken into account by a margin around the target volume of typically 2-3 mm, which can, however, be extended if the simulation demonstrates larger deviations. The novel TPS developed for scanned ion beams was introduced into clinical routine in December 1997 and was used for the treatment planning of 63 patients with head and neck tumours until July 2000. Planning strategies and methods were developed for this tumour location that facilitate the treatment of a larger number of patients with the scanned heavy ion beam in a clinical setting. Further developments aim towards a simultaneous optimization of the treatment field intensities and more effective procedures for the patient set-up. The results demonstrate that ion beams can be integrated into a clinical environment for treatment planning and delivery",

abstract="The GSI carbon ion radiotherapy facility established the first completely active beam shaping system for heavy ions, using energy variation on the synchrotron and pencil beam scanning. The introduction of an active beam shaping system for carbon ions has considerable impact on the design of the treatment planning system (TPS). The TPS has to account for the capability of the beam delivery and the biological modelling, which is needed to calculate the RBE for the resulting varying depth dose modulation. The TPS used in clinical routine with carbon ions is described and its use in treatment planning studies are outlined. A clinical trial with carbon ion therapy as primary therapy for chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the base of skull has been completed in 2001. Currently, carbon ion therapy as a boost treatment together with conventional conformal photon therapy or IMRT is under investigation in clinical trials for adenoid cystic carcinoma, chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the cervical spine and sacrococcygeal chordoma. Treatment planning studies comparing carbon ion therapy with IMRT, using optimization of combination therapy, and optimization of beam-line design have already been completed. Analysis of uncertainties in treatment planning has been started with the investigation of range uncertainties stemming from CT imaging. Uncertainties coming from the beam delivery play only a minor role. An attempt to asses the uncertainties introduced in treatment plans by the biological modelling, was done, using phantom verification of calculated cell survival levels. The clinical trials and planning studies are of special importance for the upcoming new clinical ion facility of the Heidelberg university hospital",

abstract="An international code of practice (CoP) for dosimetry based on standards of absorbed dose to water has recently been published by the IAEA [Technical Report Series No. 398, 2000] (TRS-398). This new CoP includes procedures for proton and heavy ion beams as well as all other beam qualities. In particular it defines reference conditions to which dose measurements should refer to. For proton and ion beams these conditions include dose measurements in the center of all possible modulated Bragg peaks. The recommended reference conditions in general are used also for the calibration of beam monitors. For a dynamic beam delivery system using beam scanning in combination with energy variation, like, e.g., at the German carbon ion radiotherapy facility, this calibration procedure is not appropriate. We have independently developed a different calibration procedure. Similar to the IAEA CoP this procedure is based on the measurement of absorbed dose to water. This is translated in terms of fluence which finally results in an energy-dependent calibration of the beam monitor in units of particle number per monitor unit, which is unique for all treatment fields. In contrast to the IAEA CoP, the reference depth is chosen to be very small. The procedure enables an accurate and reliable determination of calibration factors. In a second step, the calibration is verified by measurements of absorbed dose in various modulated Bragg peaks by comparing measured against calculated doses. The agreement between measured and calculated doses is usually better than 1\% for homogeneous fields and the mean deviation for more inhomogeneous treatment fields, as they are used for patient treatments, is within 3\%. It is proposed that the CoP in general, and in particular the IAEA TRS-398 should include explicit recommendations for the beam monitor calibration. These recommendations should then distinguish between systems using static and dynamic beams",

abstract="In proton and ion radiotherapy, the range of particles is calculated from x-ray computed tomography (CT) numbers. Due to the strong absorption of x-rays in a metal and a cut-off for large Hounsfield units (HU) in the software of most CT-scanners, a range calculation in metals cannot be based on the measured HU. This is of special importance when metal implants such as gold fillings or hip prostheses are close to the treatment volume. In order to overcome this problem in treatment planning for heavy charged particles, the correct ranges of ions in the metal relative to water have to be assigned in the CT data. Measurements and calculations of carbon ion ranges in various metals are presented that can be used in treatment planning to allow for a more accurate range calculation of carbon ion beams in titanium, steel, tungsten and gold. The suggested values for the relative water-equivalent range and their uncertainties are 3.13 (+/-3\%) for titanium, 5.59 (+/-3\%) for stainless steel and 10.25 (+/-4\%) for gold",

abstract="The influence of artefacts due to metal implants on the range of ion beams is investigated, using a geometrically well-defined head and pelvic phantom together with inserts from steel, titanium and tungsten. The ranges along various beam paths including artefacts were calculated from the TPS and compared to known calculations for phantoms without any insert. In the head phantom, beams intersecting the streak artefacts lead to errors in the range of around or below 1\%, which is mainly due to a cancellation of various effects. Beams through the metal or close to it show an underestimation of 3.5\% of the range for tungsten. For the pelvic phantom, a large underestimation of the range is observed for a lateral path through the metal insert. In the case of tungsten and steel, range errors of -5\% and -18\% are observed, respectively. Such beam paths are typically used for pelvic tumours in radiotherapy with ion beams. For beams in the anterior-posterior direction through the inserts, an overestimation of ion ranges of up to 3\% for titanium and 8\% for steel is expected, respectively. Beam paths outside the metal insert show a large cancellation for the lateral beams (leading to errors of around 1\% only) and somewhat higher errors for anterior-posterior beams (around 3\% for titanium and 6\% for steel). The analysis of CT data of patients with dental implants of gold as compared to patients with healthy teeth also showed a significant effect of the artefacts on the distribution of HU in the data, namely a redistribution of HU to higher and lower values as compared to patients with healthy teeth. The corresponding mean range variation was a 2.5\% reduction in the data with artefacts as compared to the data without artefacts. It is concluded that beam paths through metal implants should generally be avoided in proton and ion therapy. In this case, the underestimation of ion range due to artefacts alone may amount to 3\% for dental fillings and up to 5\% and 18\% for hip prosthesis made of titanium and steel, respectively. It is important to note that the size of the metal inserts cannot be determined correctly from the images, so that a correction of the ranges in metal also leads to large uncertainties. Finally, it should be stressed that the stated relative deviations are strictly valid only for the investigated phantoms and can only give a rough estimate on the size of range uncertainties that may appear in real patients",

This report considers incidence data through 2003 and mortality data through 2004. Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,444,920 new cancer cases and 559,650 deaths for cancers are projected to occur in the United States in 2007. Notable trends in cancer incidence and mortality rates include stabilization of the age-standardized, delay-adjusted incidence rates for all cancers combined in men from 1995 through 2003; a continuing increase in the incidence rate by 0.3\% per year in women; and a 13.6\% total decrease in age-standardized cancer death rates among men and women combined between 1991 and 2004. This report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and calendar year, as well as the proportionate contribution of selected sites to the overall trends. While the absolute number of cancer deaths decreased for the second consecutive year in the United States (by more than 3,000 from 2003 to 2004) and much progress has been made in reducing mortality rates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons under age 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by supporting new discoveries and by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population",

Breast cancer is now also the leading cause of cancer death among females in economically developing countries, a shift from the previous decade during which the most common cause of cancer death was cervical cancer. Further, the mortality burden for lung cancer among females in developing countries is as high as the burden for cervical cancer, with each accounting for 11\% of the total female cancer deaths. Although overall cancer incidence rates in the developing world are half those seen in the developed world in both sexes, the overall cancer mortality rates are generally similar. Cancer survival tends to be poorer in developing countries, most likely because of a combination of a late stage at diagnosis and limited access to timely and standard treatment. A substantial proportion of the worldwide burden of cancer could be prevented through the application of existing cancer control knowledge and by implementing programs for tobacco control, vaccination (for liver and cervical cancers), and early detection and treatment, as well as public health campaigns promoting physical activity and a healthier dietary intake. Clinicians, public health professionals, and policy makers can play an active role in accelerating the application of such interventions globally",

abstract="To identify and measure the respiratory-induced movement of calcified mediastinal lymph nodes.Methods and materialsTwenty-one patients receiving radiation therapy for primary lung or pleural tumors were noted to have calcification within one or more mediastinal lymph nodes. The breathing motion of 27 such nodes was measured with orthogonal fluoroscopic imaging during quiet respiration.ResultsAll 27 nodes showed some motion synchronous with breathing. The mean respiratory movement was 6.6 mm, 2.6 mm, and 1.4 mm in the craniocaudal, dorsoventral, and mediolateral planes, respectively. There was a significant difference in the amplitude of motion in the craniocaudal plane compared with movement in the other two directions (p ConclusionsMediastinal lymph nodes move during breathing, and this needs to be accounted for when the internal margin component of the PTV is defined. The amplitude of this movement is anisotropic and seems to be less than that reported for primary lung tumors.

abstract="BACKGROUND: Despite maximum therapy the prognosis of esophageal carcinoma still remains extremely poor. New treatment strategies including improved radiation therapy techniques promise better outcome by improving local control through precise dose delivery due to higher conformality. CASE REPORT: A 62-year-old patient with locally advanced carcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction underwent definitive radiochemotherapy with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). On positioning control with the in-room CT, the distal esophagus, and hence the tumor, was found to be highly mobile exhibiting changes in position of up to 4 cm from fraction to fraction. RESULTS: IMRT plans were created for various positions establishing a plan library to choose from as appropriate. CT scans were performed prior to each treatment fraction to clarify esophagus position in order to choose the adequate treatment plan. CONCLUSION: Image guidance was crucial in this unusual case of esophageal carcinoma. Without the information from position control CTs, the tumor would have received only about half the prescribed dose due to variations in position. For this specific case, in-room CT scans are probably superior to kilo- or megavoltage CTs due to the higher soft-tissue contrast enabling detection of positioning variation of the organ and offering the possibility to use the CT for treatment planning",

abstract="Lung cancer is the number one cause of death from cancer in the United States. Currently, there is no official recommendation to screen for lung cancer even in high-risk populations. Accordingly, we wait for patients to present with symptoms. Only 15-20\% of patients are stage I lung cancer at diagnosis. Past screening trials with chest roentgenogram and sputum cytology did not show a reduction of lung cancer mortality in the screened population. Since the completion of those trials in the early 1980s we have learned that the chest X ray is not sensitive at detecting lesions <2 cm in size, and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a 4- to 6-fold increased risk of lung cancer independent of their smoking history. Recent trials with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan screening have detected 80-85\% of lung cancers while they are stage I. The problems related to spiral CT screening are the cost and the frequent detection of benign lesions. Algorithms are being developed to try and prevent unnecessary biopsies and/or surgery. Sputum cytology is currently the only clinically approved sputum test for detecting lung cancer. However, in patients with moderate dysplasia of cytology, the LIFE autofluorescence bronchoscopy system may yield an increased sensitivity of detecting precancerous or cancerous lesions. More studies are needed before the LIFE system can be adopted as a standard clinical tool. Currently, investigators are evaluating the sputum for early lung cancer detection markers. The marker that is the most developed is the monoclonal antibody to the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 on the sputum epithelial cell surface. Encouraging preliminary results have been reported and trials are ongoing. The future looks bright for the field of lung cancer screening",

abstract="The Monte Carlo method provides the most accurate dose calculations on a patient computed tomography (CT) geometry. The increase in accuracy is, at least in part, due to the fact that instead of treating human tissues as water of various densities as in analytical algorithms, the Monte Carlo method allows human tissues to be characterized by elemental composition and mass density, and hence allows the accurate consideration of all relevant electromagnetic and nuclear interactions. On the other hand, the algorithm to convert CT Hounsfield numbers to tissue materials for Monte Carlo dose calculation introduces uncertainties. There is not a simple one to one correspondence between Hounsfield numbers and tissue materials. To investigate the effects of Hounsfield number conversion for proton Monte Carlo dose calculations, clinical proton treatment plans were simulated using the Geant4 Monte Carlo code. Three Hounsfield number to material conversion methods were studied. The results were compared in forms of dose volume histograms of gross tumor volume and clinical target volume. The differences found are generally small but can be dosimetrically significant. Further, different methods may cause deviations in the predicted proton beam range in particular for deep proton fields. Typically, slight discrepancies in mass density assignments play only a minor role in the target region, whereas more significant effects are caused by different assignments in elemental compositions. In the presence of large tissue inhomogeneities, for head and neck treatments, treatment planning decisions could be affected by these differences because of deviations in the predicted tumor coverage. Outside the target area, differences in elemental composition and mass density assignments both may play a role. This can lead to pronounced effects for organs at risk, in particular in the spread-out Bragg peak penumbra or distal regions. In addition, the significance of the elemental composition effect (dose to water vs. dose to tissue) is tissue-type dependent and is also affected by nuclear reactions",

abstract="Respiration-induced tumour motion can potentially compromise the use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) as a dose escalation tool for lung tumour treatment. We have experimentally investigated the intra-fractional organ motion effects in lung IMRT treatments delivered by multi-leaf collimator (MLC). An in-house made motor-driven platform, which moves sinusoidally with an amplitude of 1 cm and a period of 4 s, was used to mimic tumour motion. Tumour motion was simulated along cranial-caudal direction while MLC leaves moved across the patient from left to right, as in most clinical cases. The dose to a point near the centre of the tumour mass was measured according to geometric and dosimetric parameters from two five-field lung IMRT plans. For each field, measurement was done for two dose rates (300 and 500 MU min\$^\&minus;1\$), three MLC delivery modes (sliding window, step-and-shoot with 10 and 20 intensity levels) and eight equally spaced starting phases of tumour motion. The dose to the measurement point delivered from all five fields was derived for both a single fraction and 30 fractions by randomly sampling from measured dose values of each field at different initial phases. It was found that the mean dose to a moving tumour differs slightly (\$<\$2\&ndash;3\&percent;) from that to a static tumour. The variation in breathing phase at the start of dose delivery results in a maximum variation around the mean dose of greater than 30\&percent; for one field. The full width at half maximum for the probability distribution of the point dose is up to 8\&percent; for all five fields in a single fraction, but less than 1\&ndash;2\&percent; after 30 fractions. In general, lower dose rate can reduce the motion-caused dose variation and therefore might be preferable for lung IMRT when no motion mitigation techniques are used. From the two IMRT cases we studied where tumour motion is perpendicular to MLC leaf motion, the dose variation was found to be insensitive to the MLC delivery mode",

abstract="Based on statistical approach, a novel dose uncertainty model was introduced considering both nonspatial and spatial dose deviations. Non-space-oriented uncertainty is mainly caused by dosimetric uncertainties, and space-oriented dose uncertainty is the uncertainty caused by all spatial displacements. Assuming these two parts are independent, dose difference between measurement and calculation is a linear combination of nonspatial and spatial dose uncertainties. Two assumptions were made: (1) the relative standard deviation of nonspatial dose uncertainty is inversely proportional to the dose standard deviation sigma, and (2) the spatial dose uncertainty is proportional to the gradient of dose. The total dose uncertainty is a quadratic sum of the nonspatial and spatial uncertainties. The uncertainty model provides the tolerance dose bound for comparison between calculation and measurement. In the statistical uncertainty model based on a Gaussian distribution, a confidence level of 3sigma theoretically confines 99.74\% of measurements within the bound. By setting the confidence limit, the tolerance bound for dose comparison can be made analogous to that of existing dose comparison methods (e.g., a composite distribution analysis, a gamma test, a chi evaluation, and a normalized agreement test method). However, the model considers the inherent dose uncertainty characteristics of the test points by taking into account the space-specific history of dose accumulation, while the previous methods apply a single tolerance criterion to the points, although dose uncertainty at each point is significantly different from others. Three types of one-dimensional test dose distributions (a single large field, a composite flat field made by two identical beams, and three-beam intensity-modulated fields) were made to verify the robustness of the model. For each test distribution, the dose bound predicted by the uncertainty model was compared with simulated measurements. The simulated measurements were within the tolerance bound as expected by a statistical prediction of the model. Using the dose uncertainty distributions, an uncertainty length (uncertainty area and uncertainty volume for two-dimensional and three-dimensional, respectively) histogram (a plot of the dose uncertainty of 1sigma received by a length of field) was made. The histogram provides additional information on superiority of a treatment plan in terms of uncertainty. In summary, the uncertainty model provides the dose comparison tool as well as the evaluation tool of a treatment planning system",

abstract="PURPOSE: To analyze dose uncertainty using a previously published dose-uncertainty model, and to assess potential dosimetric risks existing in prostate intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: The dose-uncertainty model provides a three-dimensional (3D) dose-uncertainty distribution in a given confidence level. For 8 retrospectively selected patients, dose-uncertainty maps were constructed using the dose-uncertainty model at the 95\% CL. In addition to uncertainties inherent to the radiation treatment planning system, four scenarios of spatial errors were considered: machine only (S1), S1 + intrafraction, S1 + interfraction, and S1 + both intrafraction and interfraction errors. To evaluate the potential risks of the IMRT plans, three dose-uncertainty-based plan evaluation tools were introduced: confidence-weighted dose-volume histogram, confidence-weighted dose distribution, and dose-uncertainty-volume histogram. RESULTS: Dose uncertainty caused by interfraction setup error was more significant than that of intrafraction motion error. The maximum dose uncertainty (95\% confidence) of the clinical target volume (CTV) was smaller than 5\% of the prescribed dose in all but two cases (13.9\% and 10.2\%). The dose uncertainty for 95\% of the CTV volume ranged from 1.3\% to 2.9\% of the prescribed dose. CONCLUSIONS: The dose uncertainty in prostate IMRT could be evaluated using the dose-uncertainty model. Prostate IMRT plans satisfying the same plan objectives could generate a significantly different dose uncertainty because a complex interplay of many uncertainty sources. The uncertainty-based plan evaluation contributes to generating reliable and error-resistant treatment plans",

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate multi-detector row computed tomographic (CT) depiction of pulmonary veins to provide a road map for radiofrequency catheter ablation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For patients, institutional review board (IRB) approval was not required, and consent was obtained for treatment. Control subjects were part of an IRB-approved research protocol at the institution, in which they had consented to participate. Multi-detector row CT was performed in 23 patients (17 men, six women; mean age, 48 years +/- 11 [standard deviation]) with atrial fibrillation who were admitted for isolation of pulmonary veins by means of radiofrequency catheter ablation. Pulmonary vein anatomy was evaluated, and diameters of pulmonary vein ostia were measured. To determine the shape of ostia, a venous ostium index was calculated for all veins by dividing anterior-posterior measurements by superior-inferior measurements. Results were compared with those in a control group of 11 patients (eight men, three women; mean age, 56 years +/- 11) without atrial fibrillation. Images were evaluated by two observers in consensus. RESULTS: Pulmonary veins additional to the four main veins were found in seven (30\%) of 23 patients. Common ostia of left and right pulmonary veins were detected in 19 (83\%) and nine (39\%) patients, respectively. Early branching occurred more often with right than with left veins (19 [83\%] vs three [13\%] cases, P <.05) in both patients and control subjects. Anterior-posterior diameter of ostia was 12.8 mm +/- 3.3 for left veins, 16.2 mm +/- 3.8 for right veins, and 18.8 mm +/- 7.7 and 28.7 mm +/- 5.1 for left and right common ostia, respectively. Ostia of right pulmonary veins were more round than were ostia of left pulmonary veins (venous ostium index in patients, 0.91 +/- 0.21 vs 0.75 +/- 0.17, P <.05; in control subjects, 0.93 +/- 0.12 vs 0.82 +/- 0.17, P <.05). The CT data were used to determine ablation strategy and guide catheters during radiofrequency ablation. CONCLUSION: Multi-detector row CT provides a valuable road map for pulmonary vein anatomy prior to radiofrequency catheter ablation. Variations in number and insertion of pulmonary veins were observed in a considerable number of patients and control subjects",

abstract="INTRODUCTION: With the purpose of implementing gated radiotherapy for lung cancer patients, this study investigated the interfraction variations in tumour size and internal displacement over entire treatment courses. To explore the potential of image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) the variations were measured using a set-up strategy based on imaging of bony landmarks and compared to a strategy using in room lasers, skin tattoos and cupper landmarks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During their six week treatment course of 60Gy in 2Gy fractions, ten patients underwent 3 respiratory gated CT scans. The tumours were contoured on each CT scan to evaluate the variations in volumes and position. The lung tumours and the mediastinal tumours were contoured separately. The positional variations were measured as 3D mobility vectors and correlated to matching of the scans using the two different strategies. RESULTS: The tumour size was significantly reduced from the first to the last CT scan. For the lung tumours the reduction was 19\%, p=0.03, and for the mediastinal tumours the reduction was 34\%, p=0.0007. The mean 3D mobility vector and the SD for the lung tumours was 0.51 cm (+/-0.21) for matching using bony landmarks and 0.85 cm (+/-0.54) for matching using skin tattoos. For the mediastinal tumours the corresponding vectors and SD's were 0.55 cm (+/-0.19) and 0.72 cm (+/-0.43). The differences between the vectors were significant for the lung tumours p=0.004. The interfractional overlap of lung tumours was 80-87\% when matched using bony landmarks and 70-76\% when matched using skin tattoos. The overlap of the mediastinal tumours were 60-65\% and 41-47\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the use of gating the tumours varied considerably, regarding both position and volume. The variations in position were dependent on the set-up strategy. Set-up using IGRT was superior to set-up using skin tattoos",

abstract="In the scope of a prospective multi-centre study after neoadjuvant combined chemotherapy (carboplatin, ifosfamide, etoposide, vindesine) and radiotherapy (45 Gy) 40 resection specimens of locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer were analysed in order to establish reproducible pathological/anatomical results of tumour regression. Resection specimens of 28 squamous cell carcinomas and 12 adenocarcinomas were investigated using serial sections of the primary lesion. The mean age of the patients was 57 years. The results were compared to spontaneous regressive changes in a control group of 50 untreated non-small-cell lung cancers. Marked scarry fibrosis in the region of the former primary tumour, concentric foci of fresh tumour necroses and surrounding foam cell clusters with transition into vascular granulation tissue could be established as characteristic features of therapy-induced tumour regression, whereas untreated carcinomas revealed necroses with adjoining vital tumour tissue. Using a three-step regression system, 3 tumours could be classified as grade I (no or only slight tumour regression), 10 tumours as grade IIA (marked but incomplete tumour regression, more than 10\% vital tumour tissue), 20 tumours as grade IIB (less than 10\% vital tumour tissue) and 7 tumours as grade III (complete tumour regression without vital tumour tissue). After a median follow-up period of 32.3 months in patients with grade IIB or III tumour regression (``responders'') the median survival time of 27.9 months was found to be significantly longer than in patients with grade I or IIA tumour regression (``non-responders'') with a median survival period of 13.7 months (log-rank test, P = 0.020). The resection specimens analysed, which were obtained 7 weeks (on average) after the end of radiochemotherapy, did not show specific changes due to preoperative therapy, but quite characteristic histological alterations in the former tumour area were registered, which had been induced by combined neoadjuvant radiation and chemotherapy. The grade of therapy-induced tumour regression could be shown to be a significant prognostic factor in non-small-cell lung cancer",

abstract="The Mitchell Theory implies the proton motive force Deltap across the inner mitochondrial membrane as the energy-rich intermediate of oxidative phosphorylation. Deltap is composed mainly of an electrical (DeltaPsi(m)) and a chemical part (DeltapH) and generated by the respiratory chain complexes I, III and IV. It is consumed mostly by the ATP synthase (complex V) to produce ATP. The free energy of electron transport within the proton pumps is sufficient to generate Deltap of about 240 mV. The proton permeability of biological membranes, however, increases exponentially above 130 mV leading to a waste of energy at high values (DeltaPsi(m)>140 mV). In addition, at DeltaPsi(m)>140 mV, the production of the superoxide radical anion O(2)(-) at complexes I, II and III increases exponentially with increasing DeltaPsi(m). O(2)(-) and its neutral product H(2)O(2) (=ROS, reactive oxygen species) induce oxidative stress which participates in aging and in the generation of degenerative diseases. Here we describe a new mechanism which acts independently of the Mitchell Theory and keeps DeltaPsi(m) at low values through feedback inhibition of complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) at high ATP/ADP ratios, thus preventing the formation of ROS and maintaining high efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation",

abstract="Aging and degenerative diseases are associated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are mostly produced in mitochondria, and their levels increase with higher mitochondrial membrane potential. Cellular respiratory control is based on inhibition of respiration by high membrane potentials. However, we have described a second mechanism of respiratory control based on allosteric inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain, at high ATP:ADP ratios. The mechanism is independent of membrane potential. We have proposed that feedback inhibition of CcO by ATP keeps the membrane potential and ROS production at low levels. Various forms of stress switch off allosteric ATP-inhibition via reversible dephosphorylation of CcO, resulting in increased membrane potential and cellular ROS levels. This mechanism is proposed to represent a missing molecular link between stress and degenerative diseases",

abstract="This investigation focused on the characterization of the lateral dose fall-off following the irradiation of the target with photons, protons and carbon ions. A water phantom was irradiated with a rectangular field using photons, passively delivered protons as well as scanned protons and carbon ions. The lateral dose profile in the depth of the maximum dose was measured using an ion chamber, a diamond detector and thermoluminescence detectors TLD-600 and TLD-700. The yield of thermal neutrons was estimated for all radiation types while their complete spectrum was measured with bubble detectors during the irradiation with photons. The peripheral dose delivered by photons is significantly higher compared to both protons and carbon ions and exceeds the latter by up to two orders of magnitude at distances greater than 50 mm from the field. The comparison of passive and active delivery techniques for protons shows that, for the chosen rectangular target shape, the former has a sharper penumbra whereas the latter has a lower dose in the far-out-of-field region. When comparing scanning treatments, carbon ions present a sharper dose fall-off than protons close to the target but increasing peripheral dose with increasing incident energy. For photon irradiation, the contribution to the out-of-field dose of photoneutrons appears to be of the same order of magnitude as the scattered primary beam. Charged particles show a clear supremacy over x-rays in achieving a higher dose conformality around the target and in sparing the healthy tissue from unnecessary radiation exposure. The out-of-field dose for x-rays increases with increasing beam energy because of the production of biologically harmful neutrons",

abstract="PURPOSE: This study designed photon and proton treatment plans for patients treated with hypofractionated proton radiotherapy (PT) at the Southern Tohoku Proton Therapy Center (STPTC). We then calculated dosimetric parameters and compared results with simulated treatment plans for stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), using dose--volume histograms to clearly explain differences in dose distributions between PT and SBRT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one patients with stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (stage IA, n = 15 patients; stage IB, n = 6 patients) were studied. All tumors were located in the peripheral lung, and total dose was 66 Gray equivalents (GyE) (6.6 GyE/fraction). For treatment planning, beam incidence for proton beam technique was restricted to two to three directions for PT, and seven or eight noncoplanar beams were manually selected for SBRT to achieve optimal planning target volume (PTV) coverage and minimal dose to organs at risk. RESULTS: Regarding lung tissues, mean dose, V5, V10, V13, V15, and V20 values were 4.6 Gy, 13.2\%, 11.4\%, 10.6\%, 10.1\%, and 9.1\%, respectively, for PT, whereas those values were 7.8 Gy, 32.0\%, 21.8\%, 17.4\%, 15.3\%, and 11.4\%, respectively, for SBRT with a prescribed dose of 66 Gy. Pearson product moment correlation coefficients between PTV and dose--volume parameters of V5, V10, V15, and V20 were 0.45, 0.52, 0.58, and 0.63, respectively, for PT, compared to 0.52, 0.45, 0.71, and 0.74, respectively, for SBRT. CONCLUSIONS: Correlations between dose--volume parameters of the lung and PTV were observed and may indicate that PT is more advantageous than SBRT when treating a tumor with a relatively large PTV or several tumors.",

abstract="The quality of radiation therapy delivered for treating cancer patients is related to set-up errors and organ motion. Due to the margins needed to ensure adequate target coverage, many breast cancer patients have been shown to develop late side effects such as pneumonitis and cardiac damage. Breathing-adapted radiation therapy offers the potential for precise radiation dose delivery to a moving target and thereby reduces the side effects substantially. However, the basic requirement for breathing-adapted radiation therapy is to track and predict the target as precisely as possible. Recent studies have addressed the problem of organ motion prediction by using different methods including artificial neural network and model based approaches. In this study, we propose to use a hybrid intelligent system called ANFIS (the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system) for predicting respiratory motion in breast cancer patients. In ANFIS, we combine both the learning capabilities of a neural network and reasoning capabilities of fuzzy logic in order to give enhanced prediction capabilities, as compared to using a single methodology alone. After training ANFIS and checking for prediction accuracy on 11 breast cancer patients, it was found that the RMSE (root-mean-square error) can be reduced to sub-millimetre accuracy over a period of 20 s provided the patient is assisted with coaching. The average RMSE for the un-coached patients was 35\% of the respiratory amplitude and for the coached patients 6\% of the respiratory amplitude",

abstract="X-ray computed tomography (CT), introduced into clinical practice in 1972, was the first of the modern slice-imaging modalities. To reconstruct images mathematically from measured data and to display and to archive them in digital form was a novelty then and is commonplace today. CT has shown a steady upward trend with respect to technology, performance and clinical use independent of predictions and expert assessments which forecast in the 1980s that it would be completely replaced by magnetic resonance imaging. CT not only survived but exhibited a true renaissance due to the introduction of spiral scanning which meant the transition from slice-by-slice imaging to true volume imaging. Complemented by the introduction of array detector technology in the 1990s, CT today allows imaging of whole organs or the whole body in 5 to 20 s with sub-millimetre isotropic resolution. This review of CT will proceed in chronological order focussing on technology, image quality and clinical applications. In its final part it will also briefly allude to novel uses of CT such as dual-source CT, C-arm flat-panel-detector CT and micro-CT. At present CT possibly exhibits a higher innovation rate than ever before. In consequence the topical and most recent developments will receive the greatest attention",

abstract="This work proposes a new probabilistic mathematical model for predicting tumor motion and position based on a finite state representation using the natural breathing states of exhale, inhale and end of exhale. Tumor motion was broken down into linear breathing states and sequences of states. Breathing state sequences and the observables representing those sequences were analyzed using a hidden Markov model (HMM) to predict the future sequences and new observables. Velocities and other parameters were clustered using a k-means clustering algorithm to associate each state with a set of observables such that a prediction of state also enables a prediction of tumor velocity. A time average model with predictions based on average past state lengths was also computed. State sequences which are known a priori to fit the data were fed into the HMM algorithm to set a theoretical limit of the predictive power of the model. The effectiveness of the presented probabilistic model has been evaluated for gated radiation therapy based on previously tracked tumor motion in four lung cancer patients. Positional prediction accuracy is compared with actual position in terms of the overall RMS errors. Various system delays, ranging from 33 to 1000 ms, were tested. Previous studies have shown duty cycles for latencies of 33 and 200 ms at around 90\% and 80\%, respectively, for linear, no prediction, Kalman filter and ANN methods as averaged over multiple patients. At 1000 ms, the previously reported duty cycles range from approximately 62\% (ANN) down to 34\% (no prediction). Average duty cycle for the HMM method was found to be 100\% and 91 +/- 3\% for 33 and 200 ms latency and around 40\% for 1000 ms latency in three out of four breathing motion traces. RMS errors were found to be lower than linear and no prediction methods at latencies of 1000 ms. The results show that for system latencies longer than 400 ms, the time average HMM prediction outperforms linear, no prediction, and the more general HMM-type predictive models. RMS errors for the time average model approach the theoretical limit of the HMM, and predicted state sequences are well correlated with sequences known to fit the data",

abstract="Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia causing substantial morbidity and probably increasing the risk of death. Most commonly, it is divided into a paroxysmal form, when--by definition--episodes end spontaneously, or a persistent one that lasts and requires a medical or electrical intervention for its termination. It might be called permanent, when no further attempts seem to be indicated for its elimination. Until recently, therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing cardiac embolism and at restoring and maintaining sinus rhythm by antiarrhythmic drugs. Long-term efficacy of the latter approach is poor, since less than 50\% of patients can be maintained in stable sinus rhythm when periods of more than 1 year are considered. Can atrial fibrillation be cured? More than ten years ago Cox and coworkers demonstrated that the surgical compartimentation of both atria (MAZE procedure) is able to abolish atrial fibrillation in up to 90\% of patients with chronic paroxysmal and also persistent atrial fibrillation. However, all studies trying to imitate the MAZE procedure by electrophysiological catheter-based techniques applying radiofrequency energy to produce transmural linear lesions were either not successful or showed a non-acceptable complication rate, especially a high rate of cerebrovascular accidents. The rationale behind the principle of compartimentation of the atria is the reduction of the critical atrial muscle mass necessary to facilitate fibrillation of the atria. A different approach aiming especially at the problem of paroxysmal atial fibrillation is based on the observation that there might be a ``focal trigger'' responsible for the initiation of the atrial tachyarrhythmia and that by eliminating this focal trigger atrial fibrillation can be avoided. This hypothesis was first verified in patients by Haissaguerre et al., in fact experimental creation of ``focal atrial fibrillation'' was presented by Moe and Abildskov more than 30 years ago. During the last 3 years the concept of curing paroxysmal atrial fibrillation by applying focal radiofrequency lesions was supported by the results of several groups in more than 200 patients: 60 to 85\% of patients can be cured, but in almost half of the cases more than one procedure is necessary. Most interestingly--and this is a finding of all investigators--more than 90\% of the triggering ectopic foci are located in the pulmonary veins or in the pulmonary vein/left atrial junction. This concept is also supported by surgical experience from performing pulmonary vein isolations during open heart surgery. Most recently, the concept of eliminating the trigger was extended and applied to patients with established persistent atrial fibrillation. Until now, it has not been well established how many patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation are ``good candidates'' for a focal RF ablation procedure, nor is the risk of the procedure well defined. Besides the necessity of performing a transseptal catheterization there is the risk of cardiac embolism and pulmonary vein stenosis. The endpoint of the procedure is also not well defined: instead of trying to eliminate the ``trigger'' located in a pulmonary vein, it might be safer to isolate the ``arrhythmogenic vein''. This however, is a difficult task with current catheter technologies. It can be expected that new catheter designs for mapping and ablation and--maybe--the use of alternative energy sources--e.g., ultrasound, microwave--will make the procedure easier and applicable to more patients with drug refractory atrial fibrillation",

abstract="Charged particle therapy is generally regarded as cutting-edge technology in oncology. Many proton therapy centres are active in the USA, Europe, and Asia, but only a few centres use heavy ions, even though these ions are much more effective than x-rays owing to the special radiobiological properties of densely ionising radiation. The National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS) Chiba, Japan, has been treating cancer with high-energy carbon ions since 1994. So far, more than 8000 patients have had this treatment at NIRS, and the centre thus has by far the greatest experience in carbon ion treatment worldwide. A panel of radiation oncologists, radiobiologists, and medical physicists from the USA and Europe recently completed peer review of the carbon ion therapy at NIRS. The review panel had access to the latest developments in treatment planning and beam delivery and to all updated clinical data produced at NIRS. A detailed comparison with the most advanced results obtained with x-rays or protons in Europe and the USA was then possible. In addition to those tumours for which carbon ions are known to produce excellent results, such as bone and soft-tissue sarcoma of the skull base, head and neck, and pelvis, promising data were obtained for other tumours, such as locally recurrent rectal cancer and pancreatic cancer. The most serious impediment to the worldwide spread of heavy ion therapy centres is the high initial capital cost. The 20 years of clinical experience at NIRS can help guide strategic decisions on the design and construction of new heavy ion therapy centres",

abstract="Data on cellular inactivation resulting from mixed irradiation with charged-particle beams of different linear energy transfer (LET) are needed to design a spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) for heavy-ion radiotherapy. The present study was designed to study the relationship between the physical (LET) and biological (cell killing) properties by using different monoenergetic beams of 3He, 4He and 12C ions (12 and 18.5 MeV/nucleon) and to attempt to apply the experimental data in the design of the SOBP (3 cm width) with a 135 MeV/nucleon carbon beam. Experimental studies of the physical and biological measurements using sequentially combined irradiation were carried out to establish a close relationship between LET and cell inactivation. The results indicated that the dose-cell survival relationship for the combined high- and low-LET beams could be described by a linear-quadratic (LQ) model, in which new coefficients alpha and beta for the combined irradiation were obtained in terms of dose-averaged alpha and square root of beta for the single irradiation with monoenergetic beams. Based on the relationship obtained, the actual SOBP designed for giving a uniform biological effect at 3 cm depth was tested with the 135 MeV/nucleon carbon beam. The results of measurements of both physical (LET) and biological (90\% level of cell killing, etc.) properties clearly demonstrated that the SOBP successfully and satisfactorily retained its high dose localization and uniform depth distribution of the biological effect. Based on the application of these results, more useful refinement and development can be expected for the heavy-ion radiotherapy currently under way at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Japan",

Wobbler magnets and a scatterer were used for flattening the radiation field. A patient-positioning system using X ray and image intensifiers was also installed in the irradiation system. The depth-dose distributions of the carbon beams were modified to make a spread-out Bragg peak, which was designed based on the biophysical characteristics of monoenergetic beams. A dosimetry system for heavy-ion radiotherapy was established to deliver heavy-ion doses safely to the patients according to the treatment planning. A carbon beam of 80 keV/[mu]m in the spread-out Bragg peak was found to be equivalent in biological responses to the neutron beam that is produced at cyclotron facility in National Institute Radiological Sciences (NIRS) by bombarding 30-MeV deuteron beam on beryllium target. The fractionation schedule of the NIRS neutron therapy was adapted for the first clinical trials using carbon beams.Results: Carbon beams, 290, 350, and 400 MeV/u, were used for a clinical trial from June of 1994.

abstract="The commissioning of conformal radiotherapy system using heavy-ion beams at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) is described in detail. The system at HIMAC was upgraded for a clinical trial using a new technique: large spot uniform scanning with conformal layer stacking. The system was developed to localize the irradiation dose to the target volume more effectively than with the old system. With the present passive irradiation method using a ridge filter, a scatterer, a pair of wobbler magnets, and a multileaf collimator, the width of the spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) in the radiation field could not be changed. With dynamic control of the beam-modifying devices during irradiation, a more conformal radiotherapy could be achieved. In order to safely perform treatments with this conformal therapy, the moving devices should be watched during irradiation and the synchronousness among the devices should be verified. This system, which has to be safe for patient irradiations, was constructed and tested for safety and for the quality of the dose localization realized. Through these commissioning tests, we were successfully able to prepare the conformal technique using layer stacking for patients. Subsequent to commissioning the technique has been applied to patients in clinical trials",

abstract="Purpose: A retrospective analysis was made to examine appropriateness in the estimation of the biologic effectiveness of carbon-ion radiotherapy using resultant data from clinical trials at the heavy-ion medical accelerator complex (HIMAC) at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences in Chiba, Japan. Methods and Materials: At HIMAC, relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) values of therapeutic carbon beams were determined based on experimental results of cell responses, on values expected with the linear-quadratic model, and based on experiences with neutron therapy. We use fixed RBE values independent of dose levels, although this apparently contradicts radiobiologic observations. Our RBE system depends only on LET of the heavy-ion radiation fields. With this RBE system, over 2,000 patients have been treated by carbon beams. With data from these patients, the local control rate of non-small-cell lung cancer was analyzed to verify the clinical RBE of the carbon beam. The local control rate was compared with rates published by groups from Gunma University and Massachusetts General Hospital. Using a simplified tumor control probability (TCP) model, clinical RBE values were obtained for different levels of TCP. Results: For the 50\% level of the clinical TCP, the RBE values nearly coincide with those for in vitro human salivary gland cell survival at 10\%. For the higher levels of clinical TCP, the RBE values approach closer to those adapted in clinical trials at HIMAC",

abstract="Lung cancer is one of the most lethal form of cancer worldwide. The tumor present in the lungs is not static and changes its shape and position during each breathing cycle. In order to segment the tumor, the physicians manually outline the tumor on each slice. Slice by slice manual segmentation is prone to errors and causes physician fatigue. A semi-automatic method to segment and track the tumor in all the frames of PET data is proposed in this paper. The tumor is segmented from each slice of the first frame using wavelet features and support vector machine classifier. This segmented tumor, after validated by the experts is used in initialization of the contour for segmentation of the tumor in subsequent frames by the level set method. Another important contribution of this paper is setting up tumor volume obtained from the first frame as the termination condition for the level set method. The results obtained from the proposed methodology are very promising and eliminates the need for manual tumor segmentation. Our proposed technique also maintains consistent segmentation and the results obtained are not dependent on the operator as is the case in manual segmentation",

abstract="We have upgraded a heavy-ion radiotherapy treatment-planning system to adapt for the layer-stacking irradiation method, which is to conform a variable spread-out Bragg peak to a target volume by means of dynamic control of the conventional beam-modifying devices. The biophysical model, the beam-setup logic, and the dose-calculation algorithm implemented for the layer-stacking method are described and the expected clinical usability is discussed. The layer-stacking method was integrated in perfect accordance with the ongoing conventional treatments so that the established protocols, which are the clinically optimized dose fractionation schemes, will still be valid. On the other hand, a simulation study indicated a substantial improvement of dose distribution with the layer-stacking method though the significance may depend on the size, shape, and location of the tumor. The completed treatment system will provide an option for improved conformal radiotherapy without interfering with the conventional method and we expect a gradual expansion of the clinical cases applicable to the layer-stacking method",

With simple and specific corrections for non-equivalencies of the substitutes, a calibration accuracy of 1\% will be achieved.

abstract="18F-FRP170, 1-(2-fluoro-1-[hydroxymethyl]ethoxy)methyl-2-nitroimidazole, is a new hypoxia imaging agent for positron emission tomography. This compound was synthesized by 18F-labeling of RP170, which was developed as a new hydrophilic 2-nitroimidazole analog. In the present study, we analyzed dynamic whole-body imaging in healthy volunteers and dynamic tumor imaging in three patients with lung cancer. METHODS: Four healthy male volunteers and three lung cancer patients were enrolled in this study. Volunteers underwent dynamic whole-body scans just after injection of 18F-FRP170 for about 90 min, while the lung cancer patients underwent dynamic tumor imaging for about 60 or 120 min. Data are expressed as standardized uptake values (SUV). Regions of interest were placed over images of each organ or tumor to generate time-SUV curves. RESULTS: The series of dynamic whole-body scans showed rapid elimination of 18F-FRP170 from the kidneys following elimination from the liver. Very low physiological uptake was observed above the diaphragm. 18F-FRP170 uptake in the lung cancer lesion could be visualized clearly from early after injection. The changes of tumor SUV, tumor/blood ratio, or tumor/muscle ratio about 30 min after injection or later were small. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic imaging using 18F-FRP170 demonstrated rapid elimination from the kidney, suggesting the high hydrophilicity of this imaging agent. The background activity above the diaphragm was very low, and patients with lung cancer showed clear tumor uptake of 18F-FRP170 early after injection",

abstract="A three-dimensional (3D) intensity modulated proton therapy treatment plan to be delivered by magnetic scanning may comprise thousands of discrete beam positions. This research presents the minimization of the total scan path length by application of a fast simulated annealing (FSA) optimization algorithm. Treatment plans for clinical prostate and head and neck cases were sequenced for continuous raster scanning in two ways, and the resulting scan path lengths were compared: (1) A simple back-and-forth, top-to-bottom (zigzag) succession, and (2) an optimized path produced as a solution of the FSA algorithm. Using a first approximation of the scanning dynamics, the delivery times for the scan sequences before and after path optimization were calculated for comparison. In these clinical examples, the FSA optimization shortened the total scan path length for the 3D target volumes by approximately 13\%-56\%. The number of extraneous spilled particles was correspondingly reduced by about 13\%-54\% due to the more efficient scanning maps that eliminated multiple crossings through regions of zero fluence. The relative decrease in delivery time due to path length minimization was estimated to be less than 1\%, due to both a high scanning speed and time requirements that could not be altered by optimization (e.g., time required to change the beam energy). In a preliminary consideration of application to rescanning techniques, the decrease in delivery time was estimated to be 4\%-20\%",

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate strategies for designing compensator-based 3D proton treatment plans for mobile lung tumors using four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) images. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four-dimensional CT sets for 10 lung cancer patients were used in this study. The internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) was obtained by combining the tumor volumes at different phases of the respiratory cycle. For each patient, we evaluated four planning strategies based on the following dose calculations: (1) the average (AVE) CT; (2) the free-breathing (FB) CT; (3) the maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT; and (4) the AVE CT in which the CT voxel values inside the IGTV were replaced by a constant density (AVE\_RIGTV). For each strategy, the resulting cumulative dose distribution in a respiratory cycle was determined using a deformable image registration method. RESULTS: There were dosimetric differences between the apparent dose distribution, calculated on a single CT dataset, and the motion-corrected 4D dose distribution, calculated by combining dose distributions delivered to each phase of the 4DCT. The AVE\_RIGTV plan using a 1-cm smearing parameter had the best overall target coverage and critical structure sparing. The MIP plan approach resulted in an unnecessarily large treatment volume. The AVE and FB plans using 1-cm smearing did not provide adequate 4D target coverage in all patients. By using a larger smearing value, adequate 4D target coverage could be achieved; however, critical organ doses were increased. CONCLUSION: The AVE\_RIGTV approach is an effective strategy for designing proton treatment plans for mobile lung tumors",

abstract="In this work we develop techniques that can derive the tumor position from external respiratory surrogates (abdominal surface motion) through periodically updated internal/external correlation. A simple linear function is used to express the correlation between the tumor and surrogate motion. The function parameters are established during a patient setup session with the tumor and surrogate positions simultaneously measured at a 30 Hz rate. During treatment, the surrogate position, constantly acquired at 30 Hz, is used to derive the tumor position. Occasionally, a pair of radiographic images is acquired to enable the updating of the linear correlation function. Four update methods, two aggressive and two conservative, are investigated: (A1) shift line through the update point; (A2) re-fit line through the update point; (C1) re-fit line with extra weight to the update point; (C2) minimize the distances to the update point and previous line fit point. In the present study of eight lung cancer patients, tumor and external surrogate motion demonstrate a high degree of linear correlation which changes dynamically over time. It was found that occasionally updating the correlation function leads to more accurate predictions than using external surrogates alone. In the case of high imaging rates during treatment (greater than 2 Hz) the aggressive update methods (A1 and A2) are more accurate than the conservative ones (C1 and C2). The opposite is observed in the case of low imaging rates",

abstract="The introduction of dynamic intensity modulation into radiotherapy using conventional photon beams or scanning particle beams requires additional and efficient methods of dose verification. Dose measurements in dynamically generated dose distributions with a single ionization chamber require a complete application of the treatment field for each single measurement. Therefore measurements are performed by simultaneous use of multiple ionization chambers. The measurement is performed by a computer controlled system and is comprised of the following steps: (a) automated positioning of the ionization chambers, (b) measurement at these points, (c) a comparison with the calculated dose from the treatment planning system, and (d) documentation of the measurement. The ionization chambers are read out by a multichannel electrometer and are densely packed into a mounting of polymethylmetacrylate, which is attached to the arm of a three-dimensional motor-driven water phantom. The measured and planned dose values are displayed numerically as well as graphically. The mean deviation between measured and planned doses as well as their standard deviation are calculated and displayed. Through printouts complete documentation of the measurement is obtained and a quick decision can be made whether the dose distribution is acceptable for the patient. The system is now routinely used for dose verification at the heavy ion therapy project at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt. Up to now 242 measurements have been performed for heavy ion treatment of 30 patients. The system allows efficient verification and documentation of carbon ion fields and is in principle also applicable to intensity-modulated photon beams",

abstract="For the commissioning and operation of the German Heavy Ion Therapy Project a quality assurance program was developed and successfully applied. The complete radiotherapy process using heavy ions was carefully analyzed and divided into three areas related to beam delivery and control, safety-interlock system and medical physics issues. In this paper, the medical physics issues are addressed. Since the irradiation with heavy ions is a nonstandard modality, new concepts and ion specific tests were developed. As far as possible, national and international standard specifications for radiotherapy were adopted. For each aspect, a performance characteristic and a corresponding acceptance test were introduced. In addition, test characteristics for the constancy tests were established. For all tests, intervention thresholds and test frequencies were specified. Using the described protocol of acceptance tests, the commissioning was passed successfully. The heavy ion irradiation facility was approved by the governmental authorities on the basis of these test results. During clinical operation, constancy tests are performed at the beginning of each treatment period, in order to maintain the quality found during the acceptance tests. Up to now, 48 patients have been treated within 6 treatment periods of 4 weeks each. The concepts used and the tests developed for the quality assurance program may serve as an example of how to introduce systematically a quality assurance program for a new treatment modality",

abstract="Purpose: Conformal radiotherapy in the head and neck region requires precise and reproducible patient setup. The definition of safety margins around the clinical target volume has to take into account uncertainties of fixation and positioning. Data are presented to quantify the involved uncertainties for the system used.Methods and Materials: Interfractional reproducibility of fixation and positioning of a target point in the brain was evaluated by biplanar films. 118 film pairs obtained at 52 fractions in 4 patients were analyzed. The setup was verified at the actual treatment table position by diagnostic X-ray units aligned to the isocenter and by a stereotactic X-ray localization technique. The stereotactic coordinates of the treated isocenter, of fiducials on the mask, and of implanted internal markers within the patient were measured to determine systematic and random errors. The data are corrected for uncertainty of the localization method.Results: Displacements in target point positioning were 0.35 {\backslash}pm 0.41 mm, 1.22 {\backslash}pm 0.25 mm, and -0.74 {\backslash}pm 0.32 mm in the x, y, and z direction, respectively. The reproducibility of the fixation of the patient?s head within the mask was 0.48 mm (x), 0.67 mm (y), and 0.72 mm (z). Rotational uncertainties around an axis parallel to the x, y, and z axis were 0.72{\backslash}textdegree, 0.43{\backslash}textdegree, and 0.70{\backslash}textdegree, respectively. A simulation, based on the acquired data, yields a typical radial overall uncertainty for positioning and fixation of 1.80 {\backslash}pm 0.60 mm.Conclusions: The applied setup technique showed to be highly reproducible. The data suggest that for the applied technique, a safety margin between clinical and planning target volume of 1-2 mm along one axis is sufficient for a target at the base of skull",

abstract="At an isocentric irradiation facility, the rotation axis of the treatment table has to be accurately aligned in vertical orientation to the isocentre, which is usually marked by three perpendicular laser planes. In particular, high precision radiotherapy techniques, such as radiosurgery or intensity modulated radiotherapy, require a higher alignment accuracy of the table axis than routinely specified by the manufacturers. A simple and efficient method is presented to measure the direction and the size of the displacement of the table axis from the isocentre as marked by the lasers. In addition, the inclination of the table axis against the vertical direction can be determined. The measured displacement and inclination provide the required data to correct for possible misalignments of the treatment table axis and to maintain its alignment. Measurements were performed over a period of two years for a treatment table located at the German heavy ion therapy facility. The mean radial distance between the table axis and the isocentre was found to be 0.25 +/- 0.25 mm. The mean inclination of the table axis in the XZ- and YZ-planes was measured to be -0.03 +/- 0.02 degrees and -0.04 +/- 0.01 degrees, respectively. The measurements demonstrate the good alignment of the treatment table over the analysed time period. The described method can be applied to any isocentric irradiation facility, especially including isocentric linear accelerators used for radiosurgery or other high precision irradiation techniques",

abstract="Tumours partly surrounding the cervical spine may be treated by conformal radiotherapy (RT) using intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) with photons or heavy charged particle RT. For both, a high setup accuracy is required to spare the radiosensitive spinal cord, if a high dose is to be delivered. A phantom study was performed to determine the variation of the dose to the spinal cord surface by predefined setup errors. The measured doses were compared to those calculated by the treatment planning programme. The influence of systematic setup errors on characteristic parameters of the treatment plan quality was quantified. The largest variation of the mean and maximum doses to the spinal cord due to setup errors was significantly larger for carbon ions than for IMRT (mean: 11.9\% versus 3.9\%, max: 29.2\% versus 10.8\% of the prescribed dose). For the comparison of measured and calculated doses, mean deviations of 3\% (IMRT) and 6\% (carbon ions) of the prescribed dose were obtained. These deviations have to be considered, when the spinal cord dose is assessed from the treatment plan and they may also influence the dose prescription. Carbon ions yield better values for coverage (99.9\% versus 93.1\%) and conformality (110\% versus 126\%) of the PTV as compared to IMRT, while the spinal cord is better spared. Dose distributions produced with carbon ions, however, are more sensitive to setup errors, which have to be considered during treatment",

Applying ion therapy, uncertainties in the range and the biologically effective dose have to be considered.

abstract="Recently, ion beam radiotherapy (including protons as well as heavier ions) gained considerable interest. Although ion beam radiotherapy requires dose prescription in terms of iso-effective dose (referring to an iso-effective photon dose), absorbed dose is still required as an operative quantity to control beam delivery, to characterize the beam dosimetrically and to verify dose delivery. This paper reviews current methods and standards to determine absorbed dose to water in ion beam radiotherapy, including (i) the detectors used to measure absorbed dose, (ii) dosimetry under reference conditions and (iii) dosimetry under non-reference conditions. Due to the LET dependence of the response of films and solid-state detectors, dosimetric measurements are mostly based on ion chambers. While a primary standard for ion beam radiotherapy still remains to be established, ion chamber dosimetry under reference conditions is based on similar protocols as for photons and electrons although the involved uncertainty is larger than for photon beams. For non-reference conditions, dose measurements in tissue-equivalent materials may also be necessary. Regarding the atomic numbers of the composites of tissue-equivalent phantoms, special requirements have to be fulfilled for ion beams. Methods for calibrating the beam monitor depend on whether passive or active beam delivery techniques are used. QA measurements are comparable to conventional radiotherapy; however, dose verification is usually single field rather than treatment plan based. Dose verification for active beam delivery techniques requires the use of multi-channel dosimetry systems to check the compliance of measured and calculated dose for a representative sample of measurement points. Although methods for ion beam dosimetry have been established, there is still room for developments. This includes improvement of the dosimetric accuracy as well as development of more efficient measurement techniques",

abstract="Purpose: The tolerance of the rat spinal cord to photon and carbon ion irradiations was investigated to determine the relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) of carbon ions (12C) in the plateau region and in a 1 cm spread-out Bragg-peak. Methods and Materials: The cranial part of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord of 336 rats was irradiated with 6 or 18 fractions (Fx) of photons or 12C-ions, respectively. Animals were followed up for 300 days for the onset of paresis grade II and dose-response curves were calculated. Results: The D50-values (dose at 50\% complication probability) were 42.9 +/- 0.5 Gy, 62.2 +/- 0.9 Gy (6 and 18 Fx, 12C-plateau) and 19.2 +/- 0.2 Gy, 17.6 +/- 0.2 Gy (6 and 18 Fx 12C-peak), respectively. For photons, the D50-values were 57.0 +/- 0.7 Gy for 6 and 88.6 +/- 0.7 Gy for 18 Fx. The corresponding RBE-values were 1.33 +/- 0.02, 1.42 +/- 0.02 (6 and 18 Fx, 12C-plateau) and 2.97 +/- 0.05, 5.04 +/- 0.08 (6 and 18 Fx 12C-peak), respectively. Including data of a previously performed experiment for 1 and 2 Fx (1) the parameter [alpha]/[beta] of the LQ-model was found to be 2.8 +/- 0.4 Gy, 2.1 +/- 0.4 Gy and 37.0 +/- 5.3 Gy for photon-, 12C-plateau- and 12C-peak irradiations, respectively. Conclusions: Carbon ion irradiations of the spinal cord are significantly more effective in the peak than in the plateau region. The [alpha]/[beta]-values indicate a significant fractionation effect only for the plateau irradiations. In the Bragg-peak, the applied RBE-model correctly describes the main features although it generally underestimates the RBE by 25\%. In the plateau region, maximum deviations of up to 20\% were found. The acquired data contribute significantly to the validation of the applied RBE-model",

In this study, amorphous track structure models instead of the stochastic energy deposition are used for the MKM calculation, and it is found that the MKM calculation is useful for predicting the survival curves of the mammalian cells in vitro for (3)He-, (12)C- and (20)Ne-ion beams. The survival curves are also calculated by two different implementations of the LEM, which inherently used an amorphous track structure model. The results calculated in this manner show good agreement with the experimental results especially for the modified LEM. These results are compared to those calculated by the MKM. Comparison of the two models reveals that both models require three basic constituents: target geometry, photon survival curve and track structure, although the implementation of each model is significantly different. In the context of the amorphous track structure model, the difference between the MKM and LEM is primarily the result of different approaches calculating the biological effects of the extremely high local dose in the center of the ion track",

abstract="The looming potential of deformable alignment tools to play an integral role in adaptive radiotherapy suggests a need for objective assessment of these complex algorithms. Previous studies in this area are based on the ability of alignment to reproduce analytically generated deformations applied to sample image data, or use of contours or bifurcations as ground truth for evaluation of alignment accuracy. In this study, a deformable phantom was embedded with 48 small plastic markers, placed in regions varying from high contrast to roughly uniform regional intensity, and small to large regional discontinuities in movement. CT volumes of this phantom were acquired at different deformation states. After manual localization of marker coordinates, images were edited to remove the markers. The resulting image volumes were sent to five collaborating institutions, each of which has developed previously published deformable alignment tools routinely in use. Alignments were done, and applied to the list of reference coordinates at the inhale state. The transformed coordinates were compared to the actual marker locations at exhale. A total of eight alignment techniques were tested from the six institutions. All algorithms performed generally well, as compared to previous publications. Average errors in predicted location ranged from 1.5 to 3.9 mm, depending on technique. No algorithm was uniformly accurate across all regions of the phantom, with maximum errors ranging from 5.1 to 15.4 mm. Larger errors were seen in regions near significant shape changes, as well as areas with uniform contrast but large local motion discontinuity. Although reasonable accuracy was achieved overall, the variation of error in different regions suggests caution in globally accepting the results from deformable alignment.",

The disease stage was Stage II in 10, IIIA in 6, and IVA in 8 patients. The Common Toxicity Criteria, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria, and Child-Pugh score were used to evaluate toxicity. The antitumor effect was evaluated by the tumor response, cumulative local control, and survival rates. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 71 months (range, 63-83 months), no severe adverse effects and no treatment-related deaths occurred. The Child-Pugh score did not increase by >2 points after the start of therapy. In 78\% and 75\% of all patients, the score did not increase by >1 point in the early and late phase, respectively. The overall tumor response rate was 71\%. The local control and overall survival rate was 92\% and 92\%, 81\% and 50\%, and 81\% and 25\% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively.

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for locally advanced cervical cancer by two phase I/II clinical trials. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1995 and January 2000, 44 patients were treated with CIRT. Thirty patients had Stage IIIB disease, and 14 patients had Stage IVA disease. Median tumor size was 6.5 cm (range, 4.2-11.0 cm). The treatment consisted of 16 fractions of whole pelvic irradiation and 8 fractions of local boost. In the first study, the total dose ranged from 52.8 to 72.0 gray equivalents (GyE) (2.2-3.0 GyE per fraction). In the second study, the whole pelvic dose was fixed at 44.8 GyE, and an additional 24.0 or 28.0 GyE was given to the cervical tumor (total dose, 68.8 or 72.8 GyE). RESULTS: No patient developed severe acute toxicity. In contrast, 8 patients developed major late gastrointestinal complications. The doses resulting in major complications were > or =60 GyE. All patients with major complications were surgically salvaged. The 5-year local control rate for patients in the first and second studies was 45\% and 79\%, respectively. When treated with > or =62.4 GyE, the local control was favorable even for the patients with stage IVA disease (69\%) or for those with tumors > or =6.0 cm (64\%).

abstract="The clinical use of respiratory-gated radiotherapy and the application of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) are 2 relatively new innovations to the treatment of lung cancer. Respiratory gating can reduce the deleterious effects of intrafraction motion, and IMRT can concurrently increase tumor dose homogeneity and reduce dose to critical structures including the lungs, spinal cord, esophagus, and heart. The aim of this work is to describe the clinical implementation of respiratory-gated IMRT for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Documented clinical procedures were developed to include a tumor motion study, gated CT imaging, IMRT treatment planning, and gated IMRT delivery. Treatment planning procedures for respiratory-gated IMRT including beam arrangements and dose-volume constraints were developed. Quality assurance procedures were designed to quantify both the dosimetric and positional accuracy of respiratory-gated IMRT, including film dosimetry dose measurements and Monte Carlo dose calculations for verification and validation of individual patient treatments. Respiratory-gated IMRT is accepted by both treatment staff and patients. The dosimetric and positional quality assurance test results indicate that respiratory-gated IMRT can be delivered accurately. If carefully implemented, respiratory-gated IMRT is a practical alternative to conventional thoracic radiotherapy. For mobile tumors, respiratory-gated radiotherapy is used as the standard of care at our institution. Due to the increased workload, the choice of IMRT is taken on a case-by-case basis, with approximately half of the non-small cell lung cancer patients receiving respiratory-gated IMRT. We are currently evaluating whether superior tumor coverage and limited normal tissue dosing will lead to improvements in local control and survival in non-small cell lung cancer",

abstract="Intrafraction motion caused by breathing requires increased treatment margins for chest and abdominal radiotherapy and may lead to ?motion artefacts? in dose distributions during intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Technologies such as gated radiotherapy may significantly increase the treatment time, while breath-hold techniques may be poorly tolerated by pulmonarily compromised patients. A solution that allows reduced margins and dose distribution artefacts, without compromising delivery time, is to synchronously follow the target motion by adapting the x-ray beam using a dynamic multileaf collimator (MLC), i.e. motion adaptive x-ray therapy, or MAX-T for short. Though the target is moving with time, in the MAX-T beam view the target is static. The MAX-T method superimposes the target motion due to respiration onto the beam originally planned for delivery. Thus during beam delivery the beam is dynamically changing position with respect to the isocentre using a dynamic MLC, the leaf positions of which are dependent upon the target position. Synchronization of the MLC motion and target motion occurs using respiration gated radiotherapy equipment. The concept and feasibility of MAX-T and the capability of the treatment machine to deliver such a treatment were investigated by performing measurements for uniform and IMRT fields using a mechanical sinusoidal oscillator to simulate target motion. Target dose measurements obtained using MAX-T for a moving target were found to be equivalent to those delivered to a static target by a static beam",

abstract="Respiratory motion degrades anatomic position reproducibility during imaging, necessitates larger margins during radiotherapy planning and causes errors during radiation delivery. Computed tomography (CT) scans acquired synchronously with the respiratory signal can be used to reconstruct 4D CT scans, which can be employed for 4D treatment planning to explicitly account for respiratory motion. The aim of this research was to develop, test and clinically implement a method to acquire 4D thoracic CT scans using a multislice helical method. A commercial position-monitoring system used for respiratory-gated radiotherapy was interfaced with a third generation multislice scanner. 4D cardiac reconstruction methods were modified to allow 4D thoracic CT acquisition. The technique was tested on a phantom under different conditions: stationary, periodic motion and non-periodic motion. 4D CT was also implemented for a lung cancer patient with audio-visual breathing coaching. For all cases, 4D CT images were successfully acquired from eight discrete breathing phases, however, some limitations of the system in terms of respiration reproducibility and breathing period relative to scanner settings were evident. Lung mass for the 4D CT patient scan was reproducible to within 2.1\% over the eight phases, though the lung volume changed by 20\% between end inspiration and end expiration (870 cm\$^3\$). 4D CT can be used for 4D radiotherapy, respiration-gated radiotherapy, \&lsquo;slow\&rsquo; CT acquisition and tumour motion studies",

abstract="Four-dimensional (4D) radiotherapy is the explicit inclusion of the temporal changes in anatomy during the imaging, planning and delivery of radiotherapy. Temporal anatomic changes can occur for many reasons, though the focus of the current investigation was respiration motion for lung tumours. The aims of the current research were first to develop a 4D Monte Carlo methodology and second to apply this technique to an existing 4D treatment plan. A 4D CT scan consisting of a series of 3D CT image sets acquired at different respiratory phases was used. Deformable image registration was performed to map each CT set from the end-inhale respiration phase to the CT image sets corresponding with subsequent respiration phases. This deformable registration allowed the contours drawn on the end-inhale CT to be automatically drawn on the other respiratory phase CT image sets. A treatment plan was created on the end-inhale CT image set and then automatically created on each of the 3D CT image sets corresponding with subsequent respiration phases, based on the beam arrangement and dose prescription in the end-inhale plan. Dose calculation using Monte Carlo was simultaneously performed on each of the N (=8) 3D image sets with 1/N fewer particles per calculation than for a 3D plan. The dose distribution from each respiratory phase CT image set was mapped back to the end-inhale CT image set for analysis. This use of deformable image registration to merge all the statistically noisy dose distributions back onto one CT image set effectively yielded a 4D Monte Carlo calculation with a statistical uncertainty equivalent to a 3D calculation, with a similar calculation time for the 3D and 4D methods. Monte Carlo as a dose calculation tool for 4D radiotherapy planning has two advantages: (1) higher accuracy for calculation in electronic disequilibrium conditions, such as those encountered during lung radiotherapy, and (2) if deformable image registration is used, the calculation time for Monte Carlo is independent of the number of 3D CT image sets constituting a 4D CT, unlike other algorithms for which the calculation time scales linearly with the number of 3D CT image sets constituting a 4D CT",

abstract="PURPOSE: Dynamically compensating for target motion during radiotherapy will increase treatment accuracy. A laboratory system for real-time target tracking with a dynamic MLC has been developed. In this study, the geometric accuracy limits of this DMLC target tracking system were evaluated. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A motion simulator was programmed to follow patient-derived tumor motion paths, parallel to the leaf motion direction. A target attached to the simulator was optically tracked, and the leaf positions adjusted to continually align the DMLC beam aperture to the target. Analysis of the tracking accuracy was based on video images of the target and beam alignment. The system response time was determined and the tracking error measured. Response time-corrected tracking accuracy was also calculated to investigate the accuracy limits of an improved system. RESULTS: The response time of the system is 160 +/- 2 ms. The geometric precision for tracking patient motion is 0.6 to 1.1 mm (1 sigma) for the 3 patient datasets tested, with tracking errors relative to the original patient motion of 35, 40, and 100\%. CONCLUSIONS: A DMLC target tracking system has been developed that can account for detected motion parallel to the leaf motion direction. The tracking error has a negligible systematic component. Reducing the response time will further increase the overall system accuracy",

abstract="A strategy is proposed in which intrafraction internal target translation is corrected for by repositioning the multileaf collimator position aperture to conform to the new target pose in the beam projection, and the beam monitor units are adjusted to account for the change in the geometric relationship between the target and the beam. The purpose of this study was to investigate the dosimetric stability of the prostate and critical structures in the presence of internal target translation using the dynamic compensation strategy. Twenty-five previously treated prostate cancer patients were replanned using a four-field conformal technique to deliver 72 Gy to 95\% of the planning target volume (PTV). Internal translation was introduced by displacing the prostate PTV (no rotation or deformation was considered). Thirty-six randomly selected isotropic displacements of magnitude 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 cm were sampled for each patient, for a total of 3600 errors. Due to their anatomic relation to the prostate, the rectum and bladder contours were also moved with the same magnitude and direction as the prostate. The dynamic compensation strategy was used to correct each of these errors by conforming the beam apertures to the new target pose and adjusting the monitor units using inverse-square and off-axis factor corrections. The dynamic compensation strategy plans were then compared to the original treatment plans via dose-volume histogram (DVH) analysis. Changes of more than 5\% of the prescription dose (3.6 Gy) were deemed clinically significant. Compared to the original treatment plans, the dynamic compensation strategy produced small discrepancies in isodose distributions and DVH analyses for all structures considered apart from the femoral heads. These differences increased with the magnitude of the internal motion. Coverage of the PTV was excellent: D5, D95, and Dmean were not increased or decreased by more than 5\% of the prescription dose for any of the 3600 simulated internal motion shifts. Dose increases for adjacent organs at risk were rare. D33 of the rectum and D20 of the bladder were increased by more than 5\% of the prescription dose in 9 and 1 instances of the 3600 sampled internal motion shifts, respectively. Dmean of the right femoral head increased by more than 5\% of the prescription dose in 651 (18\%) internal motion shifts, predominantly due to the projection of the lateral beams through the femoral head for anterior prostate motion. However, D2 was not increased by more than 5\% for any of the internal motion shifts. These data demonstrate the robustness of the proposed dynamic compensation strategy for correction of internal motion in conformal prostate radiotherapy, with minimal deviation from the original treatment plans even for errors exceeding those commonly encountered in the clinic. The compensation strategy could be performed automatically with appropriate enhancements to available delivery software",

abstract="PURPOSE: Kilovoltage intrafraction monitoring (KIM) is a real-time image guidance method that uses widely available radiotherapy technology, i.e., a gantry-mounted x-ray imager. The authors report on the geometric and dosimetric results of the first patient treatment using KIM which occurred on September 16, 2014. METHODS: KIM uses current and prior 2D x-ray images to estimate the 3D target position during cancer radiotherapy treatment delivery. KIM software was written to process kilovoltage (kV) images streamed from a standard C-arm linear accelerator with a gantry-mounted kV x-ray imaging system. A 120 degrees pretreatment kV imaging arc was acquired to build the patient-specific 2D to 3D motion correlation. The kV imager was activated during the megavoltage (MV) treatment, a dual arc VMAT prostate treatment, to estimate the 3D prostate position in real-time. All necessary ethics, legal, and regulatory requirements were met for this clinical study. The quality assurance processes were completed and peer reviewed. RESULTS: During treatment, a prostate position offset of nearly 3 mm in the posterior direction was observed with KIM. This position offset did not trigger a gating event. After the treatment, the prostate motion was independently measured using kV/MV triangulation, resulting in a mean difference of less than 0.6 mm and standard deviation of less than 0.6 mm in each direction. The accuracy of the marker segmentation was visually assessed during and after treatment and found to be performing well. During treatment, there were no interruptions due to performance of the KIM software. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, KIM has been used for real-time image guidance during cancer radiotherapy. The measured accuracy and precision were both submillimeter for the first treatment fraction. This clinical translational research milestone paves the way for the broad implementation of real-time image guidance to facilitate the detection and correction of geometric and dosimetric errors, and resultant improved clinical outcomes, in cancer radiotherapy",

abstract="The depth absorbed dose and LET (linear energy transfer) distribution of different ions of clinical interest such as 1H, 4He, 7Li, and 12C ions have been investigated using the Monte Carlo code SHIELD-HIT. The energies of the projectiles correspond to ranges in water and soft tissue of approximately 260 mm. The depth dose distributions of the primary particles and their secondaries have been calculated and separated with regard to their low and high LET components. A LET value below 10 eV/nm can generally be regarded as low LET and sparsely ionizing like electrons and photons. The high LET region may be assumed to start at 20 eV/nm where on average two double-strand breaks can be formed when crossing the periphery of a nucleosome, even though strictly speaking the LET limits are not sharp and ought to vary with the charge and mass of the ion. At the Bragg peak of a monoenergetic high energy proton beam, less than 3\% of the total absorbed dose is comprised of high LET components above 20 eV/nm. The high LET contribution to the total absorbed dose in the Bragg peak is significantly larger with increasing ion charge as a natural result of higher stopping power and lower range straggling. The fact that the range straggling and multiple scattering are reduced by half from hydrogen to helium increases the possibility to accurately deposit only the high LET component in the tumor with negligible dose to organs at risk. Therefore, the lateral penumbra is significantly improved and the higher dose gradients of 7Li and 12C ions both longitudinally and laterally will be of major advantage in biological optimized radiation therapy. With increasing charge of the ion, the high LET absorbed dose in the beam entrance and the plateau regions where healthy normal tissues are generally located is also increased. The dose distribution of the high LET components in the 7Li beam is only located around the Bragg peak, characterized by a Gaussian-type distribution. Furthermore, the secondary particles produced by high energy 7Li ions in tissuelike media have mainly low LET character both in front of and beyond the Bragg peak",

abstract="In daily clinical practice, implanted fiducial markers are used to correct for prostate motion, but not for prostate deformation. The aim of this study is to investigate the variation in target and rectum dose due to the deformation of the prostate gland (without seminal vesicles). Therefore, we performed five to six MRI scans of eight healthy volunteers that exhibited large variation in rectal volume and thus prostate deformation. Prostate motion was corrected by a mask-based rigid registration which uses the delineation as well as the internal structures of the prostate gland. Per MRI scan, one IMRT plan with a PTV margin of 4 mm was created, resulting in 41 IMRT plans. The dose distribution of the IMRT plan based on the MRI scan with the minimum rectal volume was applied to the other rigidly registered MRI scans to evaluate the impact of prostate deformation. In conclusion, pre-treatment planning on the minimum rectal volume can cause a fraction dose increase (up to 15\%) to the rectum due to prostate deformation. The impact on the total dose increase to the rectum depends on the intrapatient rectum variation during treatment, but is negligible with the currently used PTV margins in a fractionated treatment",

abstract="This paper provides an overview of image registration and data fusion techniques used in radiation therapy, and examples of their use. They are used at all stages of the patient management process; for initial diagnosis and staging, during treatment planning and delivery, and after therapy to help monitor the patients' response to treatment. Most treatment planning systems now support some form of interactive or automated image registration and provide tools for mapping information, such as tissue outlines and computed dose from one imaging study to another. To complement this, modern treatment delivery systems offer means for acquiring and registering 2D and 3D image data at the treatment unit to aid patient setup. Techniques for adapting and customizing treatments during the course of therapy using 3D and 4D anatomic and functional imaging data are currently being introduced into the clinic. These techniques require sophisticated image registration and data fusion technology to accumulate properly the delivered dose and to analyse possible physiological and anatomical changes during treatment. Finally, the correlation of radiological changes after therapy with delivered dose also requires the use of image registration and fusion techniques",

abstract="In this paper we propose a novel similarity metric and a method for deformable registration of two images for a specific clinical application. The basic assumption in almost all deformable registration approaches is that there exist explicit correspondences between pixels across the two images. This principle is used to design image (dis)similarity metrics, such as sum of squared differences (SSD) or mutual information (MI). This assumption is strongly violated, for instance, within specific regions of images from abdominal or pelvic section of a patient taken at two different time points. Nevertheless, in some clinical applications, it is required to compute a smooth deformation field for all the regions within the image including the boundaries of such regions. In this paper, we propose a deformable registration method, which utilizes a priori intensity distributions of the regions delineated on one of the images to devise a new similarity measure that varies across regions of the image to establish a smooth and robust deformation field. We present validation results of the proposed method in mapping bladder, prostate, and rectum contours of computer tomography (CT) volumes of 10 patients taken for prostate cancer radiotherapy treatment planning and verification",

abstract="Deformable image registration (DIR) is an integral component for adaptive radiation therapy. However, accurate registration between daily cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and treatment planning CT is challenging, due to significant daily variations in rectal and bladder fillings as well as the increased noise levels in CBCT images. Another significant challenge is the lack of 'ground-truth' registrations in the clinical setting, which is necessary for quantitative evaluation of various registration algorithms. The aim of this study is to establish benchmark registrations of clinical patient data. Three pairs of CT/CBCT datasets were chosen for this institutional review board approved retrospective study. On each image, in order to reduce the contouring uncertainty, ten independent sets of organs were manually delineated by five physicians. The mean contour set for each image was derived from the ten contours. A set of distinctive points (round natural calcifications and three implanted prostate fiducial markers) were also manually identified. The mean contours and point features were then incorporated as constraints into a B-spline based DIR algorithm. Further, a rigidity penalty was imposed on the femurs and pelvic bones to preserve their rigidity. A piecewise-rigid registration approach was adapted to account for the differences in femur pose and the sliding motion between bones. For each registration, the magnitude of the spatial Jacobian (|JAC|) was calculated to quantify the tissue compression and expansion. Deformation grids and finite-element-model-based unbalanced energy maps were also reviewed visually to evaluate the physical soundness of the resultant deformations. Organ DICE indices (indicating the degree of overlap between registered organs) and residual misalignments of the fiducial landmarks were quantified. Manual organ delineation on CBCT images varied significantly among physicians with overall mean DICE index of only 0.7 among redundant contours. Seminal vesicle contours were found to have the lowest correlation amongst physicians (DICE = 0.5). After DIR, the organ surfaces between CBCT and planning CT were in good alignment with mean DICE indices of 0.9 for prostate, rectum, and bladder, and 0.8 for seminal vesicles. The Jacobian magnitudes |JAC| in the prostate, rectum, and seminal vesicles were in the range of 0.4-1.5, indicating mild compression/expansion. The bladder volume differences were larger between CBCT and CT images with mean |JAC| values of 2.2, 0.7, and 1.0 for three respective patients. Bone deformation was negligible (|JAC| = approximately 1.0). The difference between corresponding landmark points between CBCT and CT was less than 1.0 mm after DIR. We have presented a novel method of establishing benchmark DIR accuracy between CT and CBCT images in the pelvic region. The method incorporates manually delineated organ surfaces and landmark points as well as pixel similarity in the optimization, while ensuring bone rigidity and avoiding excessive deformation in soft tissue organs. Redundant contouring is necessary to reduce the overall registration uncertainty",

abstract="Metallic nanoparticles (MNP) are able to release localized x-rays when activated with a high energy proton beam by the particle-induced x-ray emission (PIXE) effect. The exploitation of this phenomenon in the therapeutic irradiation of tumors has been investigated. PIXE-based x-ray emission directed at CT26 tumor cells in vitro, when administered with either gold (average diameter 2 and 13 nm) or iron (average diameter 14 nm) nanoparticles (GNP or SNP), increased with MNP solution concentration over the range of 0.1-2 mg ml(-1). With irradiation by a 45 MeV proton therapy (PT) beam, higher concentrations had a decreased cell survival fraction. An in vivo study in CT26 mouse tumor models with tumor regression assay demonstrated significant tumor dose enhancement, thought to be a result of the PIXE effect when compared to conventional PT without MNP (radiation-only group) using a 45 MeV proton beam (p < 0.02). Those receiving GNP or SNP injection doses of 300 mg kg(-1) body weight before proton beam therapy demonstrated 90\% or 75\% tumor volume reduction (TVR) in 20 days post-PT while the radiation-only group showed only 18\% TVR and re-growth of tumor volume after 20 days. Higher complete tumor regression (CTR) was observed in 14-24 days after a single treatment of PT with an average rate of 33-65\% for those receiving MNP compared with 25\% for the radiation-only group. A lower bound of therapeutic effective MNP concentration range, in vivo, was estimated as 30-79 microg g(-1) tissue for both gold and iron nanoparticles. The tumor dose enhancement may compensate for an increase in entrance dose associated with conventional PT when treating large, solid tumors with a spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) technique. The use of a combined high energy Bragg peak PT with PIXE generated by MNP, or PIXE alone, may result in new treatment options for infiltrative metastatic tumors and other diffuse inflammatory diseases",

abstract="To evaluate in healthy volunteers the reproducibility of organ position using a voluntary breath-hold method with a spirometer and the feasibility of this method for extracranial stereotactic radiotherapy in a clinical setting.Methods and materialsFor this study, 5 healthy volunteers were enrolled. After training sessions, they held their breath at the end-inspiration and the end-expiration phase under spirometer-based monitoring. Computed tomography (CT) scans were performed twice at each respiratory phase, with a 10-min interval, on 2 separate days. The total number of CT scans was four at each respiratory phase. After CT volume data were transferred to a three-dimensional treatment-planning system, digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) were calculated for anterior-posterior and left-right beams. Verification was performed with DRRs relative to the diaphragm position, bony landmarks, and the isocenter in each healthy volunteer at each respiratory phase. To evaluate intrafraction reproducibility, we measured the distance between diaphragm position and bony landmarks. To evaluate interfraction reproducibility, we measured the distance between diaphragm position and the isocenter. Reproducibility and setup error were defined as the average value of the differences between each DRR with regard to the first DRR.ResultsIntrafraction reproducibility of the caudal-cranial direction was 4.0 \${\backslash}pm\$ 3.5 mm at the end-inspiration phase and 2.2 \${\backslash}pm\$ 2.0 mm at the end-expiration phase. Interfraction reproducibility of the caudal-cranial direction was 5.1 \${\backslash}pm\$ 4.8 mm at the end-inspiration phase and 2.1 \${\backslash}pm\$ 1.8 mm at the end-expiration phase.

abstract="Respiratory gating is used to counter the effects of organ motion during radiotherapy for chest tumors. The effects of variations in patient breathing patterns during a single treatment and from day to day are unknown. We evaluated the feasibility of using patient training tools and their effect on the breathing cycle regularity and reproducibility during respiratory-gated radiotherapy. To monitor respiratory patterns, we used a component of a commercially available respiratory-gated radiotherapy system (Real Time Position Management (RPM) System, Varian Oncology Systems, Palo Alto, CA 94304). This passive marker video tracking system consists of reflective markers placed on the patient's chest or abdomen, which are detected by a wall-mounted video camera. Software installed on a PC interfaced to this camera detects the marker motion digitally and records it. The marker position as a function of time serves as the motion signal that may be used to trigger imaging or treatment. The training tools used were audio prompting and visual feedback, with free breathing as a control. The audio prompting method used instructions to ``breathe in'' or ``breathe out'' at periodic intervals deduced from patients' own breathing patterns. In the visual feedback method, patients were shown a real-time trace of their abdominal wall motion due to breathing. Using this, they were asked to maintain a constant amplitude of motion. Motion traces of the abdominal wall were recorded for each patient for various maneuvers. Free breathing showed a variable amplitude and frequency. Audio prompting resulted in a reproducible frequency; however, the variability and the magnitude of amplitude increased. Visual feedback gave a better control over the amplitude but showed minor variations in frequency. We concluded that training improves the reproducibility of amplitude and frequency of patient breathing cycles. This may increase the accuracy of respiratory-gated radiation therapy",

All mediastinal structures, lungs and heart can exposure to total therapeutic dose during radiation therapy for thoracal or mediastinal malignancies such as Hodgkin disease and breast cancer. While early deaths following irradiation are caused by primary malignancies among these patients, long-term mortalities are resulted from radiation-induced morphological and functional organ abnormalities. Cardiac changes are the most frequently seen. Significant cardiac anatomical changes occur particularly in pericardium, myocardium, valves and result in severe cardiac dysfunctions after 10 to 20 years following administration of radiation into mediastinal or thoracal areas. The precision of the development of radiation-induced cardiovascular complications has increased due to achieving the complete cure of primary tumor and to the extended survival time of irradiated cases by using advanced radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy modalities. Early detection of radiation-induced morphological changes leading to cardiac dysfunction offers the possibility for early intervention such as administration of cardiovascular drugs and/or cardiac surgery in order to reduce or delay severe irreversible late complications",

abstract="The need for fast, accurate and high resolution dosimetric quality assurance in radiation therapy has been outpacing the development of new and improved 2D and 3D dosimetry techniques. This paper summarizes the efforts to create a novel and potentially very fast, 3D dosimetry method based on the observation of scintillation light from an irradiated liquid scintillator volume serving simultaneously as a phantom material and as a dose detector medium. The method, named three-dimensional scintillation dosimetry (3DSD), uses visible light images of the liquid scintillator volume at multiple angles and applies a tomographic algorithm to a series of these images to reconstruct the scintillation light emission density in each voxel of the volume. It is based on the hypothesis that with careful design and data processing, one can achieve acceptable proportionality between the local light emission density and the locally absorbed dose. The method is applied to a Ru-106 eye plaque immersed in a 16.4 cm\$^3\$ liquid scintillator volume and the reconstructed 3D dose map is compared along selected profiles and planes with radiochromic film and diode measurements. The comparison indicates that the 3DSD method agrees, within 25\% for most points or within \&sim;2 mm distance to agreement, with the relative radiochromic film and diode dose distributions in a small (\&sim;4.5 mm high and \&sim;12 mm diameter) volume in the unobstructed, high gradient dose region outside the edge of the plaque. For a comparison, the reproducibility of the radiochromic film results for our measurements ranges from 10 to 15\% within this volume. At present, the 3DSD method is not accurate close to the edge of the plaque, and further than \&sim;10 mm (\$<\$10\% central axis depth dose) from the plaque surface. Improvement strategies, considered important to provide a more accurate quick check of the dose profiles in 3D for brachytherapy applicators, are discussed",

Several devices for respiratory-correlated CT are available for clinical usage. They are based on the synchronization of the acquired CT image data with the respiratory motion using a signal from an external respiratory monitoring system. In this work, some practical aspects of clinical implementation of the multi-slice 4D CT scanner Somatom Sensation Open (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a respiratory gating system (RGS) AZ-733V (Anzai Medical, Tokyo, Japan) are discussed.

abstract="This report, compiled by experts on the treatment of mobile targets with advanced radiotherapy, summarizes the main conclusions and innovations achieved during the 4D treatment planning workshop 2013. This annual workshop focuses on research aiming to advance 4D radiotherapy treatments, including all critical aspects of time resolved delivery, such as in-room imaging, motion detection, motion managing, beam application, and quality assurance techniques. The report aims to revise achievements in the field and to discuss remaining challenges and potential solutions. As main achievements advances in the development of a standardized 4D phantom and in the area of 4D-treatment plan optimization were identified. Furthermore, it was noticed that MR imaging gains importance and high interest for sequential 4DCT/MR data sets was expressed, which represents a general trend of the field towards data covering a longer time period of motion. A new point of attention was work related to dose reconstructions, which may play a major role in verification of 4D treatment deliveries. The experimental validation of results achieved by 4D treatment planning and the systematic evaluation of different deformable image registration methods especially for inter-modality fusions were identified as major remaining challenges. A challenge that was also suggested as focus for future 4D workshops was the adaptation of image guidance approaches from conventional radiotherapy into particle therapy. Besides summarizing the last workshop, the authors also want to point out new evolving demands and give an outlook on the focus of the next workshop",

abstract="The most advanced delivery technique for proton radiotherapy is active spot scanning. So far, predominantly static targets have been treated with active spot scanning, since mobile targets in combination with dynamic treatment delivery can lead to interplay effects, causing inhomogeneous dose distributions. One way to mitigate motion effects is re-scanning. In this study we investigate the effectiveness of re-scanning in relation to different plan parameters (number of fields, field directions, number of re-scans) as well as in respect to different motion parameters (motion amplitude, motion starting phase). A systematic study was performed for three liver patients, for which ten different plans have been calculated, respectively. The treatment plans were evaluated for three different scenarios (static, motion/single-scan-delivery, motion/re-scanned-delivery). The choice of motion parameters was based on an evaluation of the 4D CT data sets of the three patients. It is shown that the effect of motion/re-scanning per fraction is largest the fewer fields per plan are used and the more the field direction differs from the main motion direction. For amplitudes up to 6 mm, re-scanning may not be required if multiple fields are used, since only dose blurring effects appear that cannot be compensated by re-scanning. For larger motion amplitudes two planning strategies are proposed",

abstract="PURPOSE: For 23 patients, an off-line positron emission tomography scan and a computed tomography scan after proton radiotherapy was performed at the Massachusetts General Hospital to assess in vivo treatment verification. A well-balanced population of patients was investigated to assess the effect of the tumor location on the accuracy of the technique. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Range verification was achieved by comparing the measured positron emission tomography activity distributions with the corresponding Monte Carlo-simulated distributions. Observed differences in the distal end of the activity distributions were analyzed as potential indicators for the range differences between the actual delivered and planned dose. RESULTS: The average spatial agreement between the measured and simulated activity distribution was within +/-3 mm, and the corresponding average absolute agreement was within +/-45\% (derived from gamma index analysis). The mean absolute range deviation at 93 randomly chosen positions in 17 treatment fields delivered to 11 patients was 3.6 mm. Characteristic differences in the agreement of the measured and simulated activity distribution for the different tumor/target sites were found. This resulted from the different effect of factors such as biologic washout effects, motion, or limitations in the Monte Carlo-simulated activity patterns. CONCLUSION: We found that intracranial and cervical spine patients can greatly benefit from off-line positron emission tomography and computed tomography range verification. However, for the successful application of the method to patients with abdominopelvic tumors, major technological and methodologic improvements are needed. Among the intracranial and cervical spine target sites, patients with arteriovenous malformations or metal implants represent groups that could especially benefit from the approach",

abstract="Advanced 4D dose calculations (4DDCs) for scanned particle therapy show that in the incidence of motion, it is insufficient to use target contours defined on one reference CT phase. ICRU Report 62 (ICRU 1999 ICRU Report 62 (Bethesda, MD: ICRU)) advises that variations in size, shape and position of CTVs relative to anatomic reference points have to be considered for internal target volumes (ITVs). In addition to geometrical margin adaption, changes of water equivalent path length have to be considered for particle therapy. Different ITV concepts have been applied to six representative patients (liver and lung indications) based on 4DCT. Geometrical ITVs (gITV) were calculated by combining deformed CTVs over all motion phases. To take into account path length changes, range adapted ITVs (raITV) were established as the union of range adapted CTVs in all phases. For gated delivery, gat\_gITVs and gat\_raITVs were calculated. Extensive 4DDCs have been performed for two exemplary patients to illustrate that neither re-scanning nor gating can sufficiently compensate for motion effects if no appropriate margins are employed and to evaluate the effectiveness of gITVs and raITVs. CTVs significantly differ from gITVs and raITVs in size (up to a factor 2 in volume). But also raITVs and gITVs differ significantly in size and are spatially displaced, particularly for lung patients. raITVs show a strong field dependence in shape. All volumes are reduced in size when gating is applied and considered during margin adaption. 4D dose distributions show big improvements when gITV or raITV are used compared to CTVs. However, the use of either gITVs or raITVs do not result in significant differences. If raITVs are used, slightly better target coverage is gained at the cost of more healthy tissue exposure. Our results emphasize that adapted target volumes have to be used for scanned particle therapy in the presence of motion. However, even though gITVs and raITVs differ significantly in shape and size, this difference does not necessarily translate into significant differences in the resultant 4D dose distributions",

abstract="PurposeTo measure the internal lung motion due to respiration using magnetic resonance images (MRIs); to evaluate the correlation between lung motion and skin surface motion and the reliability of tracking lung motion with external fiducials.Methods and materialsAn MRI protocol using fast gradient-echo sequences was developed to acquire dynamic cine images of the thoracoabdominal region along the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes. The subjects (3 healthy volunteers and 4 lung cancer patients) were instructed to perform normal or altered breathing during MRI. Lung vessels identified on MRI were used as anatomic landmarks for internal lung structures. From sagittal cine MRI scans, the positions of the lung vessels and skin surface were tracked and their movements measured. Correlation between the movements of the external markers and internal structures was then calculated and analyzed.ResultsLung vessel motion in the superior-inferior (SI) direction correlated best with mid-upper abdominal skin surface movement (correlation coefficient, 0.89 {\backslash}pm 0.09 and 0.87 {\backslash}pm 0.23 for volunteers and patients, respectively). The anterior-posterior (AP) vessel motion generally correlated poorly with the skin surface movement, with marker placement on the upper chest yielding the strongest results (correlation coefficient, 0.72 {\backslash}pm 0.23 and 0.44 {\backslash}pm 0.27 for volunteers and patients, respectively). The strength of the correlation depended on the locations of the tracked vessels, locations of the skin surface, and subjects? breathing patterns. The best correlation was seen between the motion of an abdominal fiducial and SI lung motion. Significant intersubject variability was also observed.ConclusionMovement of an external fiducial may not correlate fully with, or predict, internal lung motion. Effective monitoring of respiration may have to rely on a combination of multiple fiducials and other physiologic parameters, such as lung volume and/or air flow",

The penumbras predicted by an analytical penumbra calculation model were compared with the measured results. The results calculated by the model for various conditions agreed well with the experimental ones.

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate the dosimetric consequences for irradiated lung tissue for different respiration conditions for hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirteen patients with lung lesion undergoing SBRT treatment in shallow breathing with abdominal compression (SB+AP) underwent additional multislice CT studies in free breathing (FB), deep inspiration and expiration breath hold (DIBH, DEBH). For each patient 6 different treatment plans were designed for the various respiration conditions applying standard (7/7/10 mm), reduced (5/5/5 mm) and individual margins. The FB plan with standard margins was used as a reference. The percentage of volume of the ipsilateral lung receiving total doses > or=12, 15> or= and > or=18 Gy, mean lung dose (D(mean)), NTCP corrected for fractionation effects and the total monitor units (MU) were evaluated. RESULTS: With DIBH it was possible to reduce all lung dose parameters by about 20\%. Applying reduced margins in DIBH, this reduction was even increased to about 40\%. The standard technique (SB+AP) with individual margins showed similar results as DIBH with standard margins. DEBH showed some improvement over FB only when reduced margins were applied. Only for 5/13 patients NTCP values >1\% were obtained. For these patients a significant NTCP reduction was achieved with DIBH techniques. CONCLUSIONS: In SBRT shallow breathing with abdominal compression produces acceptable results concerning lung DVHs. DIBH, especially with reduced margins, showed the best lung sparing. For the clinical implementation of such a technique some form of gating is advisable. However, there are some practical limitations due to high fractional doses",

abstract="PURPOSE: We describe an image fusion application that addresses two basic problems that previously limited the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for geometric localization in stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). The first limitation is imposed by the use of a relocatable, MRI-incompatible, stereotactic frame for stereotactic radiotherapy. The second limitation is an inherent lack of geometric fidelity in current MRI scanners that invalidates the use of MRI for stereotactic localization. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We recently developed and implemented a novel automated method for fusing computerized tomography (CT) and MRI volumetric image studies. The method is based on a chamfer matching algorithm, and provides a quality assurance procedure to verify the accuracy of the fused image set. The image fusion protocol removes the need for stereotactic fixation of the patient for the MRI study. RESULTS: The image fusion protocol significantly improves on the spatial accuracy of the MRI study. We demonstrate the effect of distortion and the effectiveness of the fusion with a phantom study. We present two case studies, an acoustic neurinoma treated with SRS, and a pilocytic astrocytoma treated with SRT. CONCLUSION: The image fusion protocol significantly improves our logistical management of treating patients with radiosurgery and makes conformal therapy practical for treating patients with SRT. The image fusion protocol demonstrates both the superior diagnostic quality and the poor geometric fidelity of MRI. MRI is a required imaging modality in stereotactic therapy. Image fusion combines the superior MRI diagnostic quality with the superior CT geometric definition, and makes the use of MRI in stereotactic therapy possible and practical",

abstract="PURPOSE: We completed an implementation of pencil-beam scanning (PBS), a technology whereby a focused beam of protons, of variable intensity and energy, is scanned over a plane perpendicular to the beam axis and in depth. The aim of radiotherapy is to improve the target to healthy tissue dose differential. We illustrate how PBS achieves this aim in a patient with a bulky tumor. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Our first deployment of PBS uses ``broad'' pencil-beams ranging from 20 to 35 mm (full-width-half-maximum) over the range interval from 32 to 7 g/cm(2). Such beam-brushes offer a unique opportunity for treating bulky tumors. We present a case study of a large (4,295 cc clinical target volume) retroperitoneal sarcoma treated to 50.4 Gy relative biological effectiveness (RBE) (presurgery) using a course of photons and protons to the clinical target volume and a course of protons to the gross target volume. RESULTS: We describe our system and present the dosimetry for all courses and provide an interdosimetric comparison. DISCUSSION: The use of PBS for bulky targets reduces the complexity of treatment planning and delivery compared with collimated proton fields. In addition, PBS obviates, especially for cases as presented here, the significant cost incurred in the construction of field-specific hardware. PBS offers improved dose distributions, reduced treatment time, and reduced cost of treatment",

abstract="PurposeThere is limited information available on the three-dimensional (3D) motion of lung tumors. Data derived from multiple planning computed tomographic (CT) scans were used to characterize the 3D movement of small peripheral lung tumors.Methods and materialsA total of 29 data sets from patients with Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), each of which consisted of three ``rapid'' and three ``slow'' planning CT scans, were analyzed. All six scans were coregistered, and contoured gross tumor volumes (GTVs) were expanded by 5 mm to derive clinical target volumes (CTVs). Two-dimensional and 3D displacement vectors of the individual CTVs, relative to an ``optimal'' CTV derived from all six scans, were generated. Tumor mobility was correlated with location. Three-dimensional margins, which had to be added to individual CTVs to ensure coverage of ``optimal'' CTVs, were determined.ResultsNo significant correlation was observed between the anatomic location of tumors and the extent of mobility in the x, y, and z axes. However, supradiaphragmatic lesions exhibited more mobility, particularly in the craniocaudal direction. The addition of a 3D margin of 5 mm to a single slow CTV ensured full coverage of the ``optimal CTV''.ConclusionsLung tumors demonstrate significant mobility in all directions, and this did not closely correlate with anatomic location. Individualized assessment of tumor mobility remains necessary, and is possible when the CTV derived from a single slow scan is used for radiotherapy planning",

abstract="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: For a proper evaluation of the relationship between carbon ion beam dose escalation and local control in the 81 patients with 82 lesions of stage I non-small cell lung cancer, we have identified the incidence of in-field recurrence by collating the dose distribution with the CT images. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen fractions over 6 weeks for 47 patients (48 lesions) and nine fractions over 3 weeks for 34 patients were applied in the carbon dose escalation method from 59.4 to 95.4 gray equivalents (GyE) by a 10\% increment and from 68.4 to 79.2GyE by a 5\% increment, respectively. The radiation target consisted of primary tumor. Image analysis of the patients with local recurrence was systematically performed after the treatment by focusing attention on the enhanced thin slice CT images of the primary lesion. By superimposing the dose distribution on the planning CT image and marking the anatomically identified loci of recurrence, it was possible to establish the relationship between the dose distribution and the incipient loci of recurrence and to classify the recurrence patterns from the differences in the recurrence loci. RESULTS: Local recurrence was found in 19 (23.2\%) out of a total of 82 lesions. It is possible to distinguish between three recurrence patterns: Pattern 1 representing marginal recurrence and patterns 2a and 2b, which are both instances of in-field recurrence. In pattern 1, four recurrences take place from a region on the upper tumor margin. In pattern 2a, 13 recurrences take place from the center of the tumor. In pattern 2b, two recurrences take place from the near-center of the tumor. CONCLUSIONS: For the 15 in-field recurrence lesions (patterns 2a and 2b) after excluding the four marginal recurrence lesions (patterns 1), we have established that the local control shows dose-dependence. Based on this, we have determined the optimal therapeutic dose",

abstract="Swift heavy ions when penetrating through matter strip off those electrons having a smaller orbital velocity than the ion velocity. The remaining electrons screen the nuclear charge yielding an effective charge. The effective charge of the ions interacts predominantly with the target electrons causing excitation and ionizations of the target atoms. Using the Bethe Bloch formula for the energy loss combined with the Barkas formula for effective charge, the energy loss values as well as unrestricted and restricted linear transfer can be calculated within a few percent of accuracy. From the primary energy loss only a small fraction of 10\% or less is transformed into excitation. The major part of the energy loss is used for the ionization of the target atoms and the emission of the corresponding electrons with a high kinetic energy. These electrons form the track around the trajectory of the primary ion in which two thirds of the primary energy is deposited by collisions of primary, secondary and later generations of electrons with the target molecules. In the electron diffusion process the energy is transported from the center of the track into the halo. The radial dose decreases with the square of the radial distance from the center. The diameter of the track is determined by the maximum range of the emitted electrons, i.e. by the maximum energy electrons. All ions having the same velocity i.e. the same specific energy produce electrons of the same energy and therefore tracks of the same diameters independent of the effective charge. But the dose inside the track increases with the square of the effective charge. Track structure models using this continuous dose distributions produce a better agreement with the experiment than models based on microdosimetry. The critical volume as used in microdosimetry is too large compared to the size of the DNA as critical structure inside the biological objects. Track structure models yield better results because the gross-structure of the track i.e. its lateral extension and the thin down toward the end of the track is included in these calculations. In a recent refinement the repair capacity of the cell has been included in a track structure model by using the complete shouldered x-ray survival curve as a template for the local damage produced by the particle tracks. This improved model yields presently the best agreement with the experiment",

abstract="A method for simulating spot-scanned delivery to a moving tumour was developed which uses patient-specific image and plan data. The magnitude of interplay effects was investigated for two patient cases under different fractionation and respiratory motion variation scenarios. The use of volumetric rescanning for motion mitigation was also investigated. For different beam arrangements, interplay effects lead to severely distorted dose distributions for a single fraction delivery. Baseline shift variations for single fraction delivery reduced the dose to the clinical target volume (CTV) by up to 14.1 Gy. Fractionated delivery significantly reduced interplay effects; however, local overdosage of 12.3\% compared to the statically delivered dose remained for breathing period variations. Variations of the tumour baseline position and respiratory period were found to have the largest influence on target inhomogeneity; these effects were reduced with fractionation. Volumetric rescanning improved the dose homogeneity. For the CTV, underdosage was improved by up to 34\% in the CTV and overdosage to the lung was reduced by 6\%. Our results confirm that rescanning potentially increases the dose homogeneity; however, it might not sufficiently compensate motion-induced dose distortions. Other motion mitigation techniques may be required to additionally treat lung tumours with scanned proton beams",

abstract="PURPOSE: To perform comparative planning for intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and proton therapy (PT) for malignant pleural mesothelioma after radical surgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eight patients treated with IMRT after extrapleural pleuropneumonectomy (EPP) were replanned for PT, comparing dose homogeneity, target volume coverage, and mean and maximal dose to organs at risk. Feasibility of PT was evaluated regarding the dose distribution with respect to air cavities after EPP. RESULTS: Dose coverage and dose homogeneity of the planning target volume (PTV) were significantly better for PT than for IMRT regarding the volume covered by >95\% (V95) for the high-dose PTV. The mean dose to the contralateral kidney, ipsilateral kidney, contralateral lung, liver, and heart and spinal cord dose were significantly reduced with PT compared with IMRT. After EPP, air cavities were common (range, 0-850 cm(3)), decreasing from 0 to 18.5 cm(3)/day. In 2 patients, air cavity changes during RT decreased the generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) in the case of using an a value of < - 10 to the PTV2 to <2 Gy in the presence of changing cavities for PT, and to 40 Gy for IMRT. Small changes were observed for gEUD of PTV1 because PTV1 was reached by the beams before air. CONCLUSION: Both PT and IMRT achieved good target coverage and dose homogeneity. Proton therapy accomplished additional dose sparing of most organs at risk compared with IMRT. Proton therapy dose distributions were more susceptible to changing air cavities, emphasizing the need for adaptive RT and replanning",

Radial dose distributions and specific energy deposition are calculated for projectiles from protons to uranium in the energy range from one to several hundred mega-electron volts per unified atomic mass unit.

Thus it has been incorporated into our standard treatment planning system for ion therapy (TRiP). Single intensity modulated fields can be optimized with respect to a homogeneous biologically effective dose. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) is calculated separately for each voxel of the patient CT. Our radiobiologically oriented code system has been used since 1995 for the planning of irradiation experiments with cell cultures and animals such as rats and minipigs.

abstract="The increased biological effectiveness of heavy charged particle beams like e.g., carbon ions in the tumor volume in comparison to the lower effectiveness in the surrounding healthy tissue represents one of the major rationales for their application in tumor therapy. This increased effectiveness also characterizes the advantage of heavier ions compared to proton beams. The increased effectiveness has to be taken into account in treatment planning in order to estimate the corresponding photon equivalent doses in normal and tumor tissues, thus allowing a link e.g., to normal tissue dose limits in conventional photon therapy. Due to the complex dependencies of RBE on parameters like dose, beam energy, LET, atomic number and cell or tissue type, the relevant RBEs cannot be solely determined from experimental data. Therefore, within the framework of the pilot project of tumor therapy with carbon ions performed at GSI Darmstadt, treatment planning is based on a biophysical model, which has been extensively tested. The paper first summarizes the essential systematic dependencies of RBE on different parameters like e.g., dose, LET, atomic number and cell type. The basic principle of the biophysical model is then introduced, and special emphasis is given to the application of the model to in vivo and clinical endpoints. Model predictions are compared to experimental data in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the implementation of the biophysical model in the treatment planning procedure is presented. The biological verification of the whole treatment planning procedure is explained and examples of patient treatment plans are given",

abstract="Since 1997 a radiotherapy unit using fast carbon ions is operational at GSI. An intensity-controlled magnetic raster scanner together with a synchrotron allowing fast energy variation enable a unique method of purely active dose shaping in three dimensions. This contribution describes the necessary steps to establish a treatment planning system for this novel modality. We discuss the requirements for the physical beam model and the radiobiological model. Based on these we chose to implement a home-grown pencil beam model to describe the ion-tissue interaction and the Local Effect Model to calculate the RBE voxel-by-voxel. Given the large number of degrees of freedom biological dose optimization must be achieved by means of inverse treatment planning. All ion-related aspects are collected in our TRiP98 software. Biological dosimetry measuring cell survival in two dimensions turns out to be a good way to verify the model predictions as well as the actual irradiation procedure.

abstract="We describe a method for fast calculation of biological effects after ion irradiation. It is an alternative derivative of the established local effect model (LEM) and has been integrated into GSI's TRiP98 treatment planning system. We show that deviations from our classic approach for treatment planning are less than 5\% for therapeutical doses, but calculational speed can be improved by one to two orders of magnitude. This will allow sophisticated methods of treatment planning for ion irradiation, taking biological effects fully into account",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is the fourth commonest cause of death from cancer in men and women. Advantages in surgical techniques, radiation therapy techniques, chemotherapeutic regimes, and different combined-modality approaches have yielded only a modest impact on the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer. Thus there is clearly a need for additional strategies. One approach involves using the identification of a number of molecular targets that may be responsible for the resistance of cancer cells to radiation or to other cytotoxic agents. As such, these molecular determinants may serve as targets for augmentation of the radiotherapy or chemotherapy response. Of these, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been a molecular target of considerable interest and investigation, and there has been a tremendous surge of interest in pursuing targeted therapy of cancers via inhibition of the EGFR. METHODS/DESIGN: The PARC study is designed as an open, controlled, prospective, randomized phase II trial. Patients in study arm A will be treated with chemoradiation using intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) combined with gemcitabine and simultaneous cetuximab infusions. After chemoradiation the patients receive gemcitabine infusions weekly over 4 weeks. Patients in study arm B will be treated with chemoradiation using intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) combined with gemcitabine and simultaneous cetuximab infusions. After chemoradiation the patients receive gemcitabine weekly over 4 weeks and cetuximab infusions over 12 weeks. A total of 66 patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas will be enrolled. An interim analysis for patient safety reasons will be done one year after start of recruitment. Evaluation of the primary endpoint will be performed two years after the last patient's enrollment. DISCUSSION: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and the toxicity profile of trimodal therapy in pancreatic adenocarcinoma with chemoradiation therapy with gemcitabine and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and EGFR-targeted therapy using cetuximab and to compare between two different methods of cetuximab treatment schedules (concomitant versus concomitant and sequential cetuximab treatment).Secondary objectives are to determine the role and the mechanism of cetuximab in patient's chemoradiation regimen, the response rate, the potential of this combined modality treatment to concert locally advanced lesions to potentially resectable lesions, the time to progression interval and the quality of life",

abstract="PURPOSE: To report the long-term results of a randomized radiotherapy dose escalation trial for prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1993 to 1998, a total of 301 patients with stage T1b to T3 prostate cancer were accrued to a randomized external beam dose escalation trial using 70 Gy versus 78 Gy. The median follow-up is now 8.7 years. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compute rates of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure (nadir + 2), clinical failure, distant metastasis, disease-specific, and overall survival as well as complication rates at 8 years post-treatment. RESULTS: For all patients, freedom from biochemical or clinical failure (FFF) was superior for the 78-Gy arm, 78\%, as compared with 59\% for the 70-Gy arm (p = 0.004, and an even greater benefit was seen in patients with initial PSA >10 ng/ml (78\% vs. 39\%, p = 0.001). The clinical failure rate was significantly reduced in the 78-Gy arm as well (7\% vs. 15\%, p = 0.014). Twice as many patients either died of prostate cancer or are currently alive with cancer in the 70-Gy arm. Gastrointestinal toxicity of grade 2 or greater occurred twice as often in the high dose patients (26\% vs. 13\%), although genitourinary toxicity of grade 2 or greater was less (13\% vs. 8\%) and not statistically significantly different. Dose-volume histogram analysis showed that the complication rate could be significantly decreased by reducing the amount of treated rectum. CONCLUSIONS: Modest escalation in radiotherapy dose improved freedom from biochemical and clinical progression with the largest benefit in prostate cancer patients with PSA >10 ng/ml",

For treatment on the upper torso, the target organs are known to move substantially due to patient respiration. This paper deals with the technical aspects of gating the radiotherapy beam synchronously with respiration: the optimal respiration monitoring system, measurements of organ displacement and linear accelerator gating. Several respiration sensors including a thermistor, a thermocouple, a strain gauge and a pneumotachograph were examined to find the optimal sensor. The magnitude of breast, chest wall and lung motion were determined using playback of fluoroscopic x-ray images recorded on a VCR during routine radiotherapy simulation. Total dose, beam symmetry and beam uniformity were examined to determine any effects on the Varian 2100C linear accelerator due to gating",

abstract="In this paper we present a complete description of the breathing synchronized radiotherapy (BSRT) system, which has been jointly developed between the University of California Davis Cancer Center and Varian Associates. BSRT is a description of an emerging radiation oncology procedure, where simulation, CT scan, treatment planning, and radiation treatment are synchronized with voluntary breath-hold, forced breath-hold, or breathing gating. The BSRT system consists of a breathing monitoring system (BMOS) and a linear accelerator gating hardware and software package. Two methods, a video camera-based method and the use of wraparound inductive plethysmography (RespiTrace), generate the BMOS signals. The BMOS signals and the synchronized fluoroscopic images are simultaneously recorded in the simulation room and are later analyzed to define the ideal treatment point (ITP) where organ motion is stationary. The BMOS signals at ITP can be used to gate a CT scanner or a linear accelerator to maintain the same organ configuration as in the simulation. The BSRT system allows breath-hold or gating. This dual role allows the system to be applicable for a variety of patients, i.e., the breath-hold method for those patients who can maintain and reproduce the ITP, and the forced breath-hold or gating method for those who are not ideal for voluntary breath-hold",

abstract="PURPOSE: To report the clinical experience with an electromagnetic treatment target positioning and continuous monitoring system in patients with localized prostate cancer receiving external beam radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The Calypso System is a target positioning device that continuously monitors the location of three implanted electromagnetic transponders at a rate of 10 Hz. The system was used at five centers to position 41 patients over a full course of therapy. Electromagnetic positioning was compared to setup using skin marks and to stereoscopic X-ray localization of the transponders. Continuous monitoring was performed in 35 patients. RESULTS: The difference between skin mark vs. the Calypso System alignment was found to be >5 mm in vector length in more than 75\% of fractions. Comparisons between the Calypso System and X-ray localization showed good agreement. Qualitatively, the continuous motion was unpredictable and varied from persistent drift to transient rapid movements. Displacements > or =3 and > or =5 mm for cumulative durations of at least 30 s were observed during 41\% and 15\% of sessions. In individual patients, the number of fractions with displacements > or =3 mm ranged from 3\% to 87\%; whereas the number of fractions with displacements > or =5 mm ranged from 0\% to 56\%. CONCLUSION: The Calypso System is a clinically efficient and objective localization method for positioning prostate patients undergoing radiotherapy. Initial treatment setup can be performed rapidly, accurately, and objectively before radiation delivery. The extent and frequency of prostate motion during radiotherapy delivery can be easily monitored and used for motion management",

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study sample includes the first 100 consecutive localized prostate cancer patients treated to 70.0 Gy at 2.5 Gy per fraction. The median follow-up was 66 months (range, 3 to 75 months). Biochemical failure was the study endpoint, using both the ASTRO definition (A-bRFS) and the alternate ``nadir + 2 ng/mL'' definition (N-bRFS). RTOG scores were used to assess toxicity. RESULTS: The 5-year A-bRFS and N-bRFS rates were 85\% (95\%CI, 78-93\%) and 88\% (95\%CI, 82-95\%) for all cases, respectively. For low, intermediate and high-risk disease, the 5-year A-bRFS rates were 97\%, 88\%, and 70\%. The corresponding 5-year N-bRFS rates were 97\%, 93\%, and 75\%, respectively. The acute rectal toxicity scores were 0 in 20, 1 in 61, and 2 in 19 patients. The acute urinary toxicity scores were 0 in 9, 1 in 76, and 2 in 15 patients. The late rectal toxicity scores were 0 in 71, 1 in 19, 2 in 7, and 3 in 3 patients. The actuarial late Grade 3 rectal toxicity rate at 5 years was 3\%. A number of the toxicities observed either resolved spontaneously or were corrected. At last follow-up, the rate of combined Grades 2 and 3 late rectal toxicity at 5 years was only 5\%. The late urinary toxicity scores were 0 in 75, 1 in 13, 2 in 11, and 3 in 1 patients. The actuarial late Grade 3 urinary toxicity rate at 5 years was 1\%. CONCLUSION: With a median follow-up of 66 months, the long-term results after high-dose hypofractionation are excellent. Late toxicity, urinary and rectal, has been limited. High-dose hypofractionation is an alternative dose escalation method in the treatment of localized prostate cancer",

abstract="PURPOSE: The aim of this work was to study the variations in delivered doses to the prostate, rectum, and bladder during a full course of image-guided external beam radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with helical tomotherapy to 78 Gy at 2 Gy per fraction in 39 fractions. Daily target localization was performed using intraprostatic fiducials and daily megavoltage pelvic computed tomography (CT) scans, resulting in a total of 390 CT scans. The prostate, rectum, and bladder were manually contoured on each CT by a single physician. Daily dosimetric analysis was performed with dose recalculation. The study endpoints were D95 (dose to 95\% of the prostate), rV2 (absolute rectal volume receiving 2 Gy), and bV2 (absolute bladder volume receiving 2 Gy). RESULTS: For the entire cohort, the average D95 (+/-SD) was 2.02 +/- 0.04 Gy (range, 1.79-2.20 Gy). The average rV2 (+/-SD) was 7.0 +/- 8.1 cc (range, 0.1-67.3 cc). The average bV2 (+/-SD) was 8.7 +/- 6.8 cc (range, 0.3-36.8 cc). Unlike doses for the prostate, there was significant daily variation in rectal and bladder doses, mostly because of variations in volume and shape of these organs. CONCLUSION: Large variations in delivered doses to the rectum and bladder can be documented with daily megavoltage CT scans. Image guidance for the targeting of the prostate, even with intraprostatic fiducials, does not take into account the variation in actual rectal and bladder doses. The clinical impact of techniques that take into account such dosimetric parameters in daily patient set-ups should be investigated",

abstract="Purpose To report and describe implantation techniques and stability of metallic fiducials in lung lesions to be treated with external beam radiotherapy.Methods and Materials Patients undergoing radiation therapy for small early-stage lung cancer underwent implantation with small metallic markers. Implantation was either transcutaneous under computed tomographic (CT) or fluoroscopic guidance or transbronchial with the superDimension/Bronchus system (radiofrequency signal-based bronchoscopy guidance related to CT images).Results Implantation was performed transcutaneously in 15 patients and transbronchially in 8 patients. Pneumothorax occurred with eight of the 15 transcutaneous implants, six of which required chest tube placement. None of the patients who underwent transbronchial implantation developed pneumothorax. Successfully inserted markers were all usable during gated image-guided radiotherapy. Marker stability was determined by observing the variation in gross target volume (GTV) centroid relative to the marker on repeated CT scans. Average three-dimensional variation in the GTV center relative to the marker was 2.6 +/- 1.3 (SD) mm, and the largest variation along any anatomic axis for any patient was <5 mm. Average GTV volume decrease during the observation period was 34\% +/- 23\%. Gross tumor volumes do not appear to shrink uniformly about the center of the tumor, but rather the tumor shapes deform substantially throughout treatment.Conclusions Transbronchial marker placement is less invasive than transcutaneous placement, which is associated with high pneumothorax rates. Although marker geometry can be affected by tumor shrinkage, implanted markers are stable within tumors throughout the treatment duration regardless of implantation method",

abstract="In carbon therapy, doses at center of spread-out Bragg peaks depend on field size. For a small field of 5 x 5 cm2, the central dose reduces to 96\% of the central dose for the open field in case of 400 MeV/n carbon beam. Assuming the broad beam injected to the water phantom is made up of many pencil beams, the transverse dose distribution can be reconstructed by summing the dose distribution of the pencil beams. We estimated dose profiles of this pencil beam through measurements of dose distributions of broad uniform beams blocked half of the irradiation fields. The dose at a distance of a few cm from the edge of the irradiation field reaches up to a few percent of the central dose. From radiation quality measurements of this penumbra, the large-angle scattered particles were found to be secondary fragments which have lower LET than primary carbon beams. Carbon ions break up in beam modifying devices or in water phantom through nuclear interaction with target nuclei. The angular distributions of these fragmented nuclei are much broader than those of primary carbon particles. The transverse dose distribution of the pencil beam can be approximated by a function of the three-Gaussian form. For a simplest case of mono-energetic beam, contributions of the Gaussian components which have large mean deviations become larger as the depth in the water phantom increases",

abstract="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Characterization of the out-of-field dose profile following irradiation of the target with a 3D treatment plan delivered with modern techniques. METHODS: An anthropomorphic RANDO phantom was irradiated with a treatment plan designed for a simulated 5 x 2 x 5 cm(3) tumor volume located in the center of the head. The experiment was repeated with all most common radiation treatment types (photons, protons and carbon ions) and delivery techniques (Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy, passive modulation and spot scanning). The measurements were performed with active diamond detector and passive thermoluminescence (TLD) detectors to investigate the out-of-field dose both inside and outside the phantom. RESULTS: The highest out-of-field dose values both on the surface and inside the phantom were measured during the treatment with 25 MV photons. In the proximity of the Planned Target Volume (PTV), the lowest lateral dose profile was observed for passively modulated protons mainly because of the presence of the collimator in combination with the chosen volume shape. In the far out-of-field region (above 100mm from the PTV), passively modulated ions were characterized by a less pronounced dose fall-off in comparison with scanned beams. Overall, the treatment with scanned carbon ions delivered the lowest dose outside the target volume. CONCLUSIONS: For the selected PTV, the use of the collimator in proton therapy drastically reduced the dose deposited by ions or photons nearby the tumor. Scanning modulation represents the optimal technique for achieving the highest dose reduction far-out-of-field",

abstract="PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: In radiotherapy the healthy tissue involvement still poses serious dose limitations. This results in sub-optimal tumour dose and complications. Daily image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) is the key development in radiation oncology to solve this problem. MRI yields superb soft-tissue visualization and provides several imaging modalities for identification of movements, function and physiology. Integrating MRI functionality with an accelerator can make these capacities available for high precision, real time IGRT. DESIGN AND RESULTS: The system being built at the University Medical Center Utrecht is a 1.5T MRI scanner, with diagnostic imaging functionality and quality, integrated with a 6MV radiotherapy accelerator. The realization of a prototype of this hybrid system is a joint effort between the Radiotherapy Department of the University of Utrecht, the Netherlands, Elekta, Crawley, U.K., and Philips Research, Hamburg, Germany. Basically, the design is a 1.5 T Philips Achieva MRI scanner with a Magnex closed bore magnet surrounded by a single energy (6 MV) Elekta accelerator. Monte Carlo simulations are used to investigate the radiation beam properties of the hybrid system, dosimetry equipment and for the construction of patient specific dose deposition kernels in the presence of a magnetic field. The latter are used to evaluate the IMRT capability of the integrated MRI linac. CONCLUSIONS: A prototype hybrid MRI/linac for on-line MRI guidance of radiotherapy (MRIgRT) is under construction. The aim of the system is to deliver the radiation dose with mm precision based on diagnostic quality MR images",

abstract="PURPOSE: To assess the overall clinical outcome of protocol-based image-guided salvage pulsed-dose-rate brachytherapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer after radiotherapy failure particularly regarding feasibility and side effects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen consecutive patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer (median age, 69 years) were treated during 2005-2011 with interstitial PDR brachytherapy (PDR-BT) as salvage brachytherapy after radiotherapy failure. The treatment schedule was PDR-BT two times with 30 Gy (pulse dose 0.6 Gy/h, 24 h per day) corresponding to a total dose of 60 Gy. Dose volume adaptation was performed with the aim of optimal coverage of the whole prostate (V100 > 95 \%) simultaneously respecting the protocol-based dose volume constraints for the urethra (D0.1 cc < 130 \%) and the rectum (D2 cc < 50-60 \%) taking into account the previous radiation therapy. Local relapse after radiotherapy (external beam irradiation, brachytherapy with J-125 seeds or combination) was confirmed mostly via choline-PET and increased PSA levels. The primary endpoint was treatment-related late toxicities--particularly proctitis, anal incontinence, cystitis, urinary incontinence, urinary frequency/urgency, and urinary retention according to the Common Toxicity Criteria. The secondary endpoint was PSA-recurrence-free survival. RESULTS: We registered urinary toxicities only. Grade 2 and grade 3 toxicities were observed in up to 11.1 \% (2/18) and 16.7 \% (3/18) of patients, respectively. The most frequent late-event grade 3 toxicity was urinary retention in 17 \% (3/18) of patients. No late gastrointestinal side effects occurred. The biochemical PSA-recurrence-free survival probability at 3 years was 57.1 \%. The overall survival at 3 years was 88.9 \%; 22 \% (4/18) of patients developed metastases. The median follow-up time for all patients after salvage BT was 21 months (range, 8-77 months). CONCLUSION: Salvage PDR-brachytherapy of the prostate following local failure after radiation therapy is a treatment option with a low rate of genitourinary side effects and no late gastrointestinal side effects. The treatment efficacy in the first 3 years is promising",

abstract="In adaptive radiotherapy, measured patient-specific setup variations are used to modify the patient setup and treatment plan, potentially many times during the treatment course. To estimate the setup adjustments and re-plan the treatment, the measured data are usually processed using Kalman filtering or by computing running averages. We propose, as an alternative, the use of Bayesian statistical methods, which combine a population (prior) distribution of systematic and random setup errors with the measurements to determine a patient-specific (posterior) probability distribution. The posterior distribution can either be used directly in the re-planning of the treatment or in the generation of statistics needed for adjustments. Based on the assumption that day-to-day setup variations are independent and identically distributed Normal distributions, we can efficiently compute parameters of the posterior distribution from parameters of the prior distribution and statistics of the measurements. We illustrate a simple procedure to apply the method in practice to adaptive radiotherapy, allowing for multiple adjustments of treatment parameters during the course of treatment",

abstract="Respiratory motion in emission tomography leads to reduced image quality. Developed correction methodology has been concentrating on the use of respiratory synchronized acquisitions leading to gated frames. Such frames, however, are of low signal-to-noise ratio as a result of containing reduced statistics. In this work, we describe the implementation of an elastic transformation within a list-mode-based reconstruction for the correction of respiratory motion over the thorax, allowing the use of all data available throughout a respiratory motion average acquisition. The developed algorithm was evaluated using datasets of the NCAT phantom generated at different points throughout the respiratory cycle. List-mode-data-based PET-simulated frames were subsequently produced by combining the NCAT datasets with Monte Carlo simulation. A non-rigid registration algorithm based on B-spline basis functions was employed to derive transformation parameters accounting for the respiratory motion using the NCAT dynamic CT images. The displacement matrices derived were subsequently applied during the image reconstruction of the original emission list mode data. Two different implementations for the incorporation of the elastic transformations within the one-pass list mode EM (OPL-EM) algorithm were developed and evaluated. The corrected images were compared with those produced using an affine transformation of list mode data prior to reconstruction, as well as with uncorrected respiratory motion average images. Results demonstrate that although both correction techniques considered lead to significant improvements in accounting for respiratory motion artefacts in the lung fields, the elastic-transformation-based correction leads to a more uniform improvement across the lungs for different lesion sizes and locations",

Proposed methodology for correction of respiratory effects involves the use of gated frames, which are however of low signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore a method accounting for respiratory motion effects without affecting the statistical quality of the reconstructed images is necessary. We have implemented an affine transformation of list mode data for the correction of respiratory motion over the thorax. The study was performed using datasets of the NCAT phantom at different points throughout the respiratory cycle. List mode data based PET simulated frames were produced by combining the NCAT datasets with a Monte Carlo simulation.

Comparison of corrected and uncorrected respiratory motion average frames suggests that an affine transformation in the list mode data prior to reconstruction can produce significant improvements in accounting for respiratory motion artefacts in the lungs and heart. However, the application of a common set of transformation parameters across the imaging field of view does not significantly correct the respiratory effects on organs such as the stomach, liver or spleen",

abstract="Patient and internal organ motion during treatment with a scanned proton beam can introduce unplanned heterogeneities in the dose distribution throughout the irradiated volume. With static beam techniques, a margin around the target volume is added to compensate for patient and organ motion. This margin may not provide the solution with dynamic beam scanning. Intrafractional motion parallel and perpendicular to the beam axis is studied using two different scanning methods on a cubic water phantom. The direction of motion relative to the beam scanning direction as well as the method of scanning the proton beam across the target has a significant effect on the resulting dose distribution within the target volume. In the extreme cases studied here up to 100\% of the target receives a dose outside the recommended limits, with a minimum dose as low as 34\% of the prescribed dose",

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve patients were treated for prostate cancer with intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Two orthogonal portal images were taken daily. All patients underwent three computed tomography scans during the 8-week treatment time (i.e., baseline, intermediate, and final). The original treatment plans were re-evaluated, taking into account setup errors and organ motion. RESULTS: The mean shifts +/- standard deviation of the whole patient population in the lateral, anterior-posterior, and craniocaudal direction were 1.0 +/- 1.5 mm, 0.9 +/- 2.1 mm, and 1.9 +/- 2.1 mm, respectively. In most of the recalculated dose-volume histograms, the coverage of clinical target volume was granted despite organ motion, whereas the rectal wall histograms were often very different from the planned ones. CONCLUSION: We have studied the impact of prostate and rectum motion, as well as setup errors, on dose-volume histograms. The estimate of these effects may have implications for predictive indications when planning intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatments on prostate",

The inter-user variability of the contour alignment process was assessed.On the basis of the marker alignments, the initial displacement of the prostate in the AP, superoinferior, and lateral direction was -0.9 +/- 3.9, 0.1 +/- 3.9, and 0.2 +/- 3.4 mm respectively. The directed differences between the BAT and marker alignments in the respective directions were 0.2 +/- 3.7, 2.7 +/- 3.9, and 1.6 +/- 3.1 mm. The occurrence of displacements >/=5 mm was reduced by a factor of two in the AP direction after the BAT system was used. Among eight users, the average range of couch shifts due to contour alignment variability was 7, 7, and 5 mm in the antero-posterior (AP), superoinferior, and lateral direction, respectively.In our study, the BAT alignments were systematically different from the marker alignments in the superoinferior, and lateral directions. The remaining random variability of the prostate position after the ultrasound-based alignment was similar to the initial variability. However, the occurrence of displacements >/=5 mm was reduced in the AP direction. The inter-user variation of the contour alignment process was significant",

abstract="PURPOSE: To quantify and describe the real-time movement of the prostate gland in a large data set of patients treated with radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The Calypso four-dimensional localization system was used for target localization in 17 patients, with electromagnetic markers implanted in the prostate of each patient. We analyzed a total of 550 continuous tracking sessions. The fraction of time that the prostate was displaced by >3, >5, >7, and >10 mm was calculated for each session and patient. The frequencies of displacements after initial patient positioning were analyzed over time. RESULTS: Averaged over all patients, the prostate was displaced >3 and >5 mm for 13.6\% and 3.3\% of the total treatment time, respectively. For individual patients, the corresponding maximal values were 36.2\% and 10.9\%. For individual fractions, the corresponding maximal values were 98.7\% and 98.6\%. Displacements >3 mm were observed at 5 min after initial alignment in about one-eighth of the observations, and increased to one-quarter by 10 min. For individual patients, the maximal value of the displacements >3 mm at 5 and 10 min after initial positioning was 43\% and 75\%, respectively. CONCLUSION: On average, the prostate was displaced by >3 mm and >5 mm approximately 14\% and 3\% of the time, respectively. For individual patients, these values were up to three times greater. After the initial positioning, the likelihood of displacement of the prostate gland increased with elapsed time. This highlights the importance of initiating treatment shortly after initially positioning the patient",

abstract="INTRODUCTION: Improved prostate localization techniques should allow the reduction of margins around the target to facilitate dose escalation in high-risk patients while minimizing the risk of normal tissue morbidity. A daily CT simulation technique is presented to assess setup variations in portal placement and organ motion for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Six patients who consented to this study underwent supine position CT simulation with an alpha cradle cast, intravenous contrast, and urethrogram. Patients received 46 Gy to the initial Planning Treatment Volume (PTV1) in a four-field conformal technique that included the prostate, seminal vesicles, and lymph nodes as the Gross Tumor Volume (GTV1). The prostate or prostate and seminal vesicles (GTV2) then received 56 Gy to PTV2. All doses were delivered in 2-Gy fractions. After 5 weeks of treatment (50 Gy), a second CT simulation was performed. The alpha cradle was secured to a specially designed rigid sliding board. The prostate was contoured and a new isocenter was generated with appropriate surface markers. Prostate-only treatment portals for the final conedown (GTV3) were created with a 0.25-cm margin from the GTV to PTV. On each subsequent treatment day, the patient was placed in his cast on the sliding board for a repeat CT simulation. The daily isocenter was recalculated in the anterior/posterior (A/P) and lateral dimension and compared to the 50-Gy CT simulation isocenter. Couch and surface marker shifts were calculated to produce portal alignment. To maintain proper positioning, the patients were transferred to a stretcher while on the sliding board in the cast and transported to the treatment room where they were then transferred to the treatment couch. The patients were then treated to the corrected isocenter. Portal films and electronic portal images were obtained for each field. RESULTS: Utilizing CT-CT image registration (fusion) of the daily and 50-Gy baseline CT scans, the isocenter changes were quantified to reflect the contribution of positional (surface marker shifts) error and absolute prostate motion relative to the bony pelvis. The maximum daily A/P shift was 7.3 mm. Motion was less than 5 mm in the remaining patients and the overall mean magnitude change was 2.9 mm. The overall variability was quantified by a pooled standard deviation of 1.7 mm. The maximum lateral shifts were less than 3 mm for all patients. With careful attention to patient positioning, maximal portal placement error was reduced to 3 mm. CONCLUSION: In our experience, prostate motion after 50 Gy was significantly less than previously reported. This may reflect early physiologic changes due to radiation, which restrict prostate motion. This observation is being tested in a separate study. Intrapatient and overall population variance was minimal. With daily isocenter correction of setup and organ motion errors by CT imaging, PTV margins can be significantly reduced or eliminated. We believe this will facilitate further dose escalation in high-risk patients with minimal risk of increased morbidity. This technique may also be beneficial in low-risk patients by sparing more normal surrounding tissue",

abstract="Purpose: Daily CT localization has been demonstrated to be a precise method of correcting radiation field placement by reducing setup and organ motion variations to facilitate dose escalation in prostate carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of daily ultrasound-guided localization utilizing daily CT as a standard. The relatively simple computer-assisted ultrasound-based system is designed to be an efficient means of achieving daily accuracy.Methods and Materials: After five weeks of conformal external beam radiation therapy, 23 patients underwent a second CT simulation. Prostate-only fields based on this scan were created with no PTV margin. On each of the final conedown treatment days, a repeat CT simulation and isocenter comparison was performed. Ten of the above patients also underwent prostate localization with a newly developed ultrasound-based system (BAT(TM)) that is designed to facilitate patient positioning at the treatment machine. The portable system, which electronically imports the CT simulation target contours and isocenter, is situated adjacent to the treatment couch. Transverse and sagittal suprapubic ultrasound images are captured, and the system overlays the corresponding CT contours relative to the machine isocenter. The CT contours are maneuvered in three dimensions by a touch screen menu to match the ultrasound images. The system then displays the 3-D couch shifts required to produce field alignment.Results: The BAT(TM) ultrasound system produced good quality images with minimal operator training required. The localization process was completed in less than 5 min. The absolute magnitude difference between CT and ultrasound was small (A/P range 0 to 5.9 mm, mean 3 mm {\backslash}pm 1.8; Lat. range 0 to 7.9 mm, mean 2.4 mm {\backslash}pm 1.8; S/I range 0 to 9 mm, mean 4.6 mm {\backslash}pm 2.8). Analysis confirmed a significant correlation of isocenter shifts (A/P r = 0.66, p p p Conclusions: Daily CT localization is a precise method to improve daily target localization in prostate carcinoma. However, it requires significant human and technical resources that limit its widespread applicability. Conversely, localization with the BAT(TM) ultrasound system is simple and expeditious by virtue of its ability to image the prostate at the treatment machine in the treatment position. Our initial evaluation revealed ultrasound targeting to be functionally equivalent to CT. This ultrasound technology is promising and warrants further investigation in more patients and at other anatomical sites",

abstract="PURPOSE: Radiation therapy to the pelvic lymph nodes in high-risk prostate cancer is required on several Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) clinical trials. Based on a prior lymph node contouring project, we have shown significant disagreement in the definition of pelvic lymph node volumes among genitourinary radiation oncology specialists involved in developing and executing current RTOG trials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consensus meeting was held on October 3, 2007, to reach agreement on pelvic lymph node volumes. Data were presented to address the lymph node drainage of the prostate. Extensive discussion ensued to develop clinical target volume (CTV) pelvic lymph node consensus. RESULTS: Consensus was obtained resulting in computed tomography image-based pelvic lymph node CTVs. Based on this consensus, the pelvic lymph node volumes to be irradiated include: distal common iliac, presacral lymph nodes (S(1)-S(3)), external iliac lymph nodes, internal iliac lymph nodes, and obturator lymph nodes. Lymph node CTVs include the vessels (artery and vein) and a 7-mm radial margin being careful to ``carve out'' bowel, bladder, bone, and muscle. Volumes begin at the L5/S1 interspace and end at the superior aspect of the pubic bone. Consensus on dose-volume histogram constraints for OARs was also attained. CONCLUSIONS: Consensus on pelvic lymph node CTVs for radiation therapy to address high-risk prostate cancer was attained and is available as web-based computed tomography images as well as a descriptive format through the RTOG. This will allow for uniformity in evaluating the benefit and risk of such treatment",

abstract="Four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) offers an extra dimension of 'time' on the three-dimensional patient model with which we can incorporate target motion in radiation treatment (RT) planning and delivery in various ways such as in the concept of internal target volume, in gated treatment or in target tracking. However, for all these methodologies, different phases are essentially considered as non-interconnected independent phases for the purpose of optimization, in other words, the 'time' dimension has yet to be incorporated explicitly in the optimization algorithm and fully exploited. In this note, we have formulated a new 4D inverse planning technique that treats all the phases in the 4DCT as one single entity in the optimization. The optimization is formulated as a quadratic problem for disciplined convex programming that enables the problem to be analyzed and solved efficiently. In the proof-of-principle examples illustrated, we show that the temporal information of the spatial relation of the target and organs at risk could be 'exchanged' amongst different phases so that an appropriate weighting of dose deposition could be allocated to each phase, thus enabling a treatment with a tight target margin and a full duty cycle otherwise not achievable by either of the aforementioned methodologies. Yet there are practical issues to be solved in the 4D RT planning and delivery. The 4D concept in the optimization we have formulated here does provide insight on how the 'time' dimension can be exploited in the 4D optimization process",

The goal of this translation is to further improve programmability and make existing OpenMP applications amenable to execution on GPGPUs. In this paper, we have identified several key transformation techniques, which enable efficient GPU global memory access, to achieve high performance. Experimental results from two important kernels (JACOBI and SPMUL) and two NAS OpenMP Parallel Benchmarks (EP and CG) show that the described translator and compile-time optimizations work well on both regular and irregular applications, leading to performance improvements of up to 50X over the unoptimized translation (up to 328X over serial on a CPU)",

abstract="This paper presents a new approach to inverse consistent image registration. A uni-directional algorithm is developed using symmetric cost functionals and regularizers. Instead of enforcing inverse consistency using an additional penalty that penalizes inconsistency error, the new algorithm directly models the backward mapping by inverting the forward mapping. The resulting minimization problem can then be solved uni-directionally involving only the forward mapping, without optimizing in the backward direction. Lastly, we evaluated the algorithm by applying it to the serial MRI scans of a clinical case of semantic dementia. The statistical distributions of the local volume change (Jacobian) maps were examined by considering the Kullback-Liebler distances on the material density functions. Contrary to common belief, the values of any non-trivial Jacobian map do not follow a log-normal distribution with zero mean. Statistically significant differences were detected between consistent versus inconsistent matching when permutation tests were performed on the resulting deformation maps",

abstract="Maps of local tissue compression or expansion are often computed by comparing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans using nonlinear image registration. The resulting changes are commonly analyzed using tensor-based morphometry to make inferences about anatomical differences, often based on the Jacobian map, which estimates local tissue gain or loss. Here, we provide rigorous mathematical analyses of the Jacobian maps, and use themto motivate a new numerical method to construct unbiased nonlinear image registration. First, we argue that logarithmic transformation is crucial for analyzing Jacobian values representing morphometric differences. We then examine the statistical distributions of log-Jacobian maps by defining the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance on material density functions arising in continuum-mechanical models. With this framework, unbiased image registration can be constructed by quantifying the symmetric KL-distance between the identity map and the resulting deformation. Implementation details, addressing the proposed unbiased registration as well as the minimization of symmetric image matching functionals, are then discussed and shown to be applicable to other registration methods, such as inverse consistent registration. In the results section, we test the proposed framework, as well as present an illustrative application mapping detailed 3-D brain changes in sequential magnetic resonance imaging scans of a patient diagnosed with semantic dementia. Using permutation tests, we show that the symmetrization of image registration statistically reduces skewness in the log-Jacobian map",

abstract="Purpose: To assess the feasibility of an online strategy for palliative radiotherapy (RT) of spinal bone metastasis, which integrates imaging, planning, and treatment delivery in a single step at the treatment unit. The technical challenges of this approach include cone-beam CT (CBCT) image quality for target definition, online planning, and efficient process integration. Methods and Materials: An integrated imaging, planning, and delivery system was constructed and tested with phantoms. The magnitude of CBCT image artifacts following the use of an antiscatter grid and a nonlinear scatter correction was quantified using phantom data and images of patients receiving conventional palliative RT of the spine. The efficacy of online planning was then assessed using corrected CBCT images. Testing of the complete process was performed on phantoms with assessment of timing and dosimetric accuracy. Results: The use of image corrections reduced the cupping artifact from 30\% to 4.5\% on CBCT images of a body phantom and improved the accuracy of CBCT numbers (water: +/- 20 Hounsfield unit [HU], and lung and bone: to within +/- 130 HU). Bony anatomy was clearly visible and was deemed sufficient for target definition. The mean total time (n = 5) for application of the online approach was 23.1 min. Image-guided dose placement was assessed using radiochromic film measurements with good agreement (within 5\% of dose difference and 2 mm of distance to agreement). Conclusions: The technical feasibility of CBCT-guided online planning and delivery for palliative single treatment has been demonstrated. The process was performed in one session equivalent to an initial treatment slot (<30 min) with dosimetric accuracy satisfying accepted RT standards",

abstract="PURPOSE: We reviewed our seven year single institution experience with pulsed dose rate brachytherapy dose escalation study in patients with intermediate and high risk prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We treated a total of 130 patients for intermediate and high risk prostate cancer at our institution between 2000 and 2007 using PDR-brachytherapy as a boost after conformal external beam radiation therapy to 50.4 Gy. The majority of patients had T2 disease (T1c 6\%, T2 75\%, T3 19\%). Seventy three patients had intermediate-risk and 53 patients had high-risk disease according to the D'Amico classification. The dose of the brachytherapy boost was escalated from 25 to 35 Gy - 33 pts. received 25 Gy (total dose 75 Gy), 63 pts. 30 Gy (total dose 80 Gy) and 34 pts. 35 Gy, (total dose 85 Gy) given in one session (dose per pulse was 0.60 Gy or 0.70 Gy/h, 24h per day, night and day, with a time interval of 1h between two pulses). PSA-recurrence-free survival according to Kaplan-Meier using the Phoenix definition of biochemical failure was calculated and also late toxicities according to Common Toxicity Criteria scale were assessed. RESULTS: At the time of analysis with a median follow-up of 60 months biochemical control was achieved by 88\% of patients - only 16/130 patients (12.3\%) developed a biochemical relapse. Biochemical relapse free survival calculated according to Kaplan-Meier for all patients at 5 years was 85.6\% (83.9\% for intermediate-risk patients and 84.2\% for high-risk patients) and at 9 years' follow up it was 79.0\%. Analysing biochemical relapse free survival separately for different boost dose levels, at 5 years it was 97\% for the 35 Gy boost dose and 82\% for the 25 and 30 Gy dose levels. The side effects of therapy were negligible: There were 18 cases (15\%) of grade 1/2 rectal proctitis, one case (0.8\%) of grade 3 proctitis, 18 cases (15\%) of grade 1/2 cystitis, and no cases (0\%) with dysuria grade 3. No patient had a bulbourethral stricture requiring dilation or new onset incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: Image-guided conformal PDR-brachytherapy using up to 35 Gy as boost dose after 50 Gy of external beam radiation therapy (total dose up to 85 Gy) is a very effective treatment option with very low morbidity in patients with intermediate or high risk prostate cancer. Further dose escalation seems possible",

abstract="To investigate the feasibility of four-dimensional radiotherapy (4DRT) planning from a tumor-tracking beam's eye view (ttBEV) with reliable gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation, realistic normal tissue representation, high planning accuracy and low clinical workload, we propose and validate a novel 4D conformal planning strategy based on a synthesized 3.5D computed tomographic (3.5DCT) image with a motion-compensated tumor. To recreate patient anatomy from a ttBEV in the moving tumor coordinate system for 4DRT planning (or 4D planning), the centers of delineated GTVs in all phase CT images of 4DCT were aligned, and then the aligned CTs were averaged to produce a new 3.5DCT image. This GTV-motion-compensated CT contains a motionless target (with motion artifacts minimized) and motion-blurred normal tissues (with a realistic temporal density average). Semi-automatic threshold-based segmentation of the tumor, lung and body was applied, while manual delineation was used for other organs at risk (OARs). To validate this 3.5DCT-based 4D planning strategy, five patients with peripheral lung lesions of small size (<5 cm(3)) and large motion range (1.2-3.5 cm) were retrospectively studied for stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) using 3D conformal radiotherapy planning tools. The 3.5DCT-based 4D plan (3.5DCT plan) with 9-10 conformal beams was compared with the 4DCT-based 4D plan (4DCT plan). The 4DCT plan was derived from multiple 3D plans based on all phase CT images, each of which used the same conformal beam configuration but with an isocenter shift to aim at the moving tumor and a minor beam aperture and weighting adjustment to maintain plan conformality. The dose-volume histogram (DVH) of the 4DCT plan was created with two methods: one is an integrated DVH (iDVH(4D)), which is defined as the temporal average of all 3D-phase-plan DVHs, and the other (DVH(4D)) is based on the dose distribution in a reference phase CT image by dose warping from all phase plans using the displacement vector field (DVF) from a free-form deformable image registration (DIR). The DVH(3.5D) (for the 3.5DCT plan) was compared with both iDVH(4D) and DVH(4D). To quantify the DVH difference between the 3.5DCT plan and the 4DCT plan, two methods were used: relative difference (\%) of the areas underneath the DVH curves and the volumes receiving more than 20\% (V20) and 50\% (V50) of prescribed dose of these 4D plans. The volume of the delineated GTV from different phase CTs varied dramatically from 24\% to 112\% among the five patients, whereas the GTV from 3.5DCT deviated from the averaged GTV in 4DCT by only -6\%+/-6\%. For planning tumor volume (PTV) coverage, the difference between the DVH(3.5D) and iDVH(4D) was negligible (<1\% area), whereas the DVH(3.5D) and DVH(4D) were quite different, due to DIR uncertainty ( approximately 2 mm), which propagates to PTV dose coverage with a pronounced uncertainty for small tumors (0.3-4.0 cm(3)) in stereotactic plans with sharp dose falloff around PTV. For OARs, such as the lung, heart, cord and esophagus, the three DVH curves (DVH(3.5D), DVH(4D) and iDVH(4D)) were found to be almost identical for the same patients, especially in high-dose regions. For the tumor-containing lung, the relative difference of the areas underneath the DVH curves was found to be small (5.3\% area on average), of which 65\% resulted from the low-dose region (D < 20\%). The averaged V20 difference between the two 4D plans was 1.2\% +/- 0.8\%. For the mean lung dose (MLD), the 3.5DCT plan differed from the 4DCT plan by -1.1\%+/-1.3\%. GTV-motion-compensated CT (3.5DCT) produces an accurate and reliable GTV delineation, which is close to the mean GTV from 4DCT. The 3.5DCT plan is equivalent to the 4DCT plan with <1\% dose difference to the PTV and negligible dose difference in OARs. The 3.5DCT approach simplifies 4D planning and provides accurate dose calculation without a substantial increase of clinical workload for motion-tracking delivery to treat small peripheral lung tumors with large motion",

abstract="Target motion is one of the major limitations of each high precision radiation therapy. Using advanced active beam delivery techniques, such as the magnetic raster scanning system for particle irradiation, the interplay between time-dependent beam and target position heavily distorts the applied dose distribution. This paper presents a simulation environment in which the time-dependent effect of target motion on heavy-ion irradiation can be calculated with dynamically scanned ion beams. In an extension of the existing treatment planning software for ion irradiation of static targets (TRiP) at GSI, the expected dose distribution is calculated as the sum of several sub-distributions for single target motion states. To investigate active compensation for target motion by adapting the position of the therapeutic beam during irradiation, the planned beam positions can be altered during the calculation. Applying realistic parameters to the planned motion-compensation methods at GSI, the effect of target motion on the expected dose uniformity can be simulated for different target configurations and motion conditions. For the dynamic dose calculation, experimentally measured profiles of the beam extraction in time were used. Initial simulations show the feasibility and consistency of an active motion compensation with the magnetic scanning system and reveal some strategies to improve the dose homogeneity inside the moving target. The simulation environment presented here provides an effective means for evaluating the dose distribution for a moving target volume with and without motion compensation. It contributes a substantial basis for the experimental research on the irradiation of moving target volumes with scanned ion beams at GSI which will be presented in upcoming papers."

abstract="Four-dimensional (4D) CT is useful in many clinical situations, where detailed abdominal and thoracic imaging is needed over the course of the respiratory cycle. However, it usually delivers a larger radiation dose than the standard three-dimensional (3D) CT, since multiple scans at each couch position are required in order to provide the temporal information. Our purpose in this work is to develop a method to perform 4D CT scans at relatively low current, hence reducing the radiation exposure of the patients. To deal with the increased statistical noise caused by the low current, we proposed a novel 4D penalized weighted least square (4D-PWLS) smoothing method, which can incorporate both spatial and phase information. The 4D images at different phases were registered to the same phase via a deformable model, thereby, a regularization term combining temporal and spatial neighbors can be designed for the 4D-PWLS objective function. The proposed method was tested with phantom experiments and a patient study, and superior noise suppression and resolution preservation were observed. A quantitative evaluation of the benefit of the proposed method to 4D radiotherapy and 4D PET/CT imaging are under investigation",

abstract="Positron emission tonography (PET) is useful in diagnosis and radiation treatment planning for a variety of cancers. For patients with cancers in thoracic or upper abdominal region, the respiratory motion produces large distortions in the tumor shape and size, affecting the accuracy in both diagnosis and treatment. Four-dimensional (4D) (gated) PET aims to reduce the motion artifacts and to provide accurate measurement of the tumor volume and the tracer concentration. A major issue in 4D PET is the lack of statistics. Since the collected photons are divided into several frames in the 4D PET scan, the quality of each reconstructed frame degrades as the number of frames increases. The increased noise in each frame heavily degrades the quantitative accuracy of the PET imaging. In this work, we propose a method to enhance the performance of 4D PET by developing a new technique of 4D PET reconstruction with incorporation of an organ motion model derived from 4D-CT images. The method is based on the well-known maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (ML-EM) algorithm. During the processes of forward- and backward-projection in the ML-EM iterations, all projection data acquired at different phases are combined together to update the emission map with the aid of deformable model, the statistics is therefore greatly improved. The proposed algorithm was first evaluated with computer simulations using a mathematical dynamic phantom. Experiment with a moving physical phantom was then carried out to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method and the increase of signal-to-noise ratio over three-dimensional PET. Finally, the 4D PET reconstruction was applied to a patient case",

abstract="In prostate radiation therapy, inter-fractional organ motion/deformation has posed significant challenges on reliable daily dose delivery. To correct for this issue, off-line re-optimization and online re-positioning have been used clinically. In this paper, we propose an adaptive images guided radiation therapy (AIGRT) scheme that combines these two correction methods in an anatomy-driven fashion. The AIGRT process first tries to find a best plan for the daily target from a plan pool, which consists of the original CT plan and all previous re-optimized plans. If successful, the selected plan is used for daily treatment with translational shifts. Otherwise, the AIGRT invokes the re-optimization process of the CT plan for the anatomy of the day, which is afterward added to the plan pool as a candidate for future fractions. The AIGRT scheme is evaluated by comparisons with daily re-optimization and online re-positioning techniques based on daily target coverage, organs at risk (OAR) sparing and implementation efficiency. Simulated treatment courses for 18 patients with re-optimization alone, re-positioning alone and AIGRT shows that AIGRT offers reliable daily target coverage that is highly comparable to daily re-optimization and significantly improves from re-positioning.

Apart from dosimetric benefits, AIGRT in addition offers an efficient scheme to integrate re-optimization to current re-positioning-based IGRT workflow",

abstract="We propose a planning method to design true 4-dimensional (4D) intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plans, called the t4Dplan method, in which the planning target volume (PTV) of the individual phases of the 4D computed tomography (CT) and the conventional PTV receive non-uniform doses but the cumulative dose to the PTV of each phase, computed using deformable image registration (DIR), are uniform. The non-uniform dose prescription for the conventional PTV was obtained by solving linear equations that required motion-convolved 4D dose to be uniform to the PTV for the end-exhalation phase (PTV50) and by constraining maximum inhomogeneity to 20\%. A plug-in code to the treatment planning system was developed to perform the IMRT optimization based on this non-uniform PTV dose prescription. The 4D dose was obtained by summing the mapped doses from individual phases of the 4D CT using DIR. This 4D dose distribution was compared with that of the internal target volume (ITV) method. The robustness of the 4D plans over the course of radiotherapy was evaluated by computing the 4D dose distributions on repeat 4D CT datasets. Three patients with lung tumors were selected to demonstrate the advantages of the t4Dplan method compared with the commonly used ITV method. The 4D dose distribution using the t4Dplan method resulted in greater normal tissue sparing (such as lung, stomach, liver and heart) than did plans designed using the ITV method. The dose volume histograms of cumulative 4D doses to the PTV50, clinical target volume, lung, spinal cord, liver, and heart on the 4D repeat CTs for the two patients were similar to those for the 4D dose at the time of original planning",

abstract="This work introduces a gating technique that uses 4DCT to determine gating parameters and to plan gated treatment, and employs a Siemens linear accelerator to deliver the gated treatment. Because of technology incompatibility, the 4DCT scanner (LightSpeed, GE) and the Siemens accelerator require two different motion-monitoring systems. The motion monitoring system (AZ-773V, Anzai Med.) used for the gated delivery utilizes a pressure sensor to detect the external respiratory motion (pressure change) in real time. Another system (RPM, Varian) used for the 4DCT scanner (LightSpeed, GE) is based on an infrared camera to detect motion of external markers. These two motion monitoring systems (RPM and Anzai systems) were found to correlate well with each other. The depth doses and profile measured for gated delivery (with a duty cycle of 25\% or 50\%) were found to agree within 1.0\% with those measured for ungated delivery, indicating that gating did not significantly alter beam characteristics. The measurement verified also that the MU linearity and beam output remained unchanged (within 0.3\%). A practical method of using 4DCT to plan a gated treatment was developed. The duty cycle for either phase or amplitude gating can be determined based on 4DCT with consideration of set-up error and delivery efficiency. The close-loop measurement involving the entire gating process (imaging, planning, and delivery) showed that the measured isodose distributions agreed with those intended, validating the accuracy and reliability of the gating technique. Based these observations, we conclude that the gating technique introduced in this work, integrating Siemens linear accelerator and Anzai pressure sensor device with GE/Varian RPM 4DCT, is reliable and effective, and it can be used clinically to account for respiratory motion during radiation therapy",

abstract="For tumors with highly complex shapes, a 'patching' strategy is often used in passively scattered proton therapy to match the sharp distal edge of the spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) of the patch field to the lateral penumbra of the through field at 50\% dose level. The differences in the dose gradients at the distal edge and at the lateral penumbra could cause hot and cold doses at the junction. In this note, we describe an algorithm developed to optimize the range compensator design to yield a more uniform dose distribution at the junction. The algorithm is based on the fact that the distal fall-off of the SOBP can be tailored using a grid filter that is placed perpendicular to the beam's path. The filter is optimized so that the distal fall-off of the patch field complements the lateral penumbra fall-off of the through field. In addition to optimizing the fall-off, the optimization process implicitly accounts for the limitations of conventional compensator design algorithms. This algorithm uses simple ray tracing to determine the compensator shape and ignore scatter. The compensated dose distribution may therefore differ substantially from the intended dose distribution, especially when complex heterogeneities are encountered, such as those in the head and neck. In such a case, an adaptive optimization strategy can be used to optimize the 'grid' filter locally considering the tissue heterogeneities. The grid filter thus obtained is superimposed on the original range compensator so that the composite compensator leads to a more uniform dose distribution at the patch junction. An L-shaped head and neck tumor was used to demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm. A robustness analysis with focus on range uncertainty effect is carried out",

abstract="While intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) has great potential to improve the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy, IMPT optimization can be computationally demanding, particularly for large and complex tumors. Here we propose a dose calculation strategy to accelerate IMPT optimization while reducing memory requirements. By using two adjustable threshold parameters, our method separates dose contributions from proton beamlets into major and minor components for each dose voxel. The optimization proceeds with two levels of iterations: in inner iterations, doses are updated in correspondence with changes in beamlet intensities from only the major contributions while keeping the portions from the minor contributions constant; in outer iterations, doses are recalculated exactly by considering both major and minor contributions. Since the number of elements in the influence matrix for major contributions is relatively small, each inner iteration proceeds quickly. Each outer iteration requires a longer computation time, but only a few such iterations are needed. Our study shows that the proposed strategy leads to nearly identical dose distributions as those optimized with the full influence matrix, but reducing computing time by at least a factor of 3 and internal memory requirements by a factor of 10 or more. In addition, we show that the proposed approach could enhance other optimization-related applications such as optimizing beam angles. By using an advanced lung cancer case that would demand large computing resources by conventional optimization approach, we show how our method may potentially help improve IMPT treatment planning in real clinical situations",

abstract="PURPOSE: The authors we evaluate the uncertainty in proton therapy dose distribution for prostate cancer due to organ displacement, varying penumbra width of proton beams, and the amount of rectal gas inside the rectum. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Proton beam treatment plans were generated for ten prostate patients with a minimum dose of 74.1 cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) to the planning target volume (PTV) while 95\% of the PTV received 78 CGE. Two lateral or lateral oblique proton beams were used for each plan. The authors we investigated the uncertainty in dose to the rectal wall (RW) and the bladder wall (BW) due to organ displacement by comparing the dose-volume histograms (DVH) calculated with the original or shifted contours. The variation between DVHs was also evaluated for patients with and without rectal gas in the rectum for five patients who had 16 to 47 cc of visible rectal gas in their planning computed tomography (CT) imaging set. The uncertainty due to the varying penumbra width of the delivered protons for different beam setting options on the proton delivery system was also evaluated. RESULTS: For a 5 mm anterior shift, the relative change in the RW volume receiving 70 CGE dose (V70) was 37.9\% (5.0\% absolute change in 13.2\% of a mean V70). The relative change in the BW volume receiving 70 CGE dose (V70) was 20.9\% (4.3\% absolute change in 20.6\% of a mean V70) with a 5 mm inferior shift. A 2 mm penumbra difference in beam setting options on the proton delivery system resulted in the relative variations of 6.1\% (0.8\% absolute change) and 4.4\% (0.9\% absolute change) in V70 of RW and BW, respectively. The data show that the organ displacements produce absolute DVH changes that generally shift the entire isodose line while maintaining the same shape. The overall shape of the DVH curve for each organ is determined by the penumbra and the distance of the target in beam's eye view (BEV) from the block edge. The beam setting option producing a 2 mm sharper penumbra at the isocenter can reduce the magnitude of maximal doses to the RW by 2\% compared to the alternate option utilizing the same block margin of 7 mm. The dose to 0.1 cc of the femoral head on the distal side of the lateral-posterior oblique beam is increased by 25 CGE for a patient with 25 cc of rectal gas. CONCLUSION: Variation in the rectal and bladder wall DVHs due to uncertainty in the position of the organs relative to the location of sharp dose falloff gradients should be accounted for when evaluating treatment plans. The proton beam delivery option producing a sharper penumbra reduces maximal doses to the rectal wall. Lateral-posterior oblique beams should be avoided in patients prone to develop a large amount of rectal gas",

abstract="PURPOSE: This study aims to develop an EPID-guided 4D patient dose reconstruction framework and to investigate its feasibility for lung SBRT treatment validation. METHODS: Both the beam apertures and tumor movements were detected based on the continuously acquired EPID images during the treatment. Instead of directly using the transit photon fluence measured by the EPID, this method reconstructed the entrance fluence with the measured beam apertures and the delivered MUs. The entrance fluence distributions were sorted into their corresponding phases based on the detected tumor motion pattern and then accumulated for each phase. Together with the in-room 4DCT taken before every treatment to consider the interfractional-motion, the entrance fluence was then used for the patient dose calculation. Deformable registration was performed to sum up the phase doses for final treatment assessment. The feasibility of using the transit EPID images for entrance fluence reconstruction was evaluated against EPID in-air measurements. The accuracy of 3D- and 4D-dose reconstruction was validated by experiments with a motor-driven cylindrical diode array for six clinical-SBRT plans. RESULTS: The average difference between the measured and reconstructed fluence maps was within 0.16\%. The reconstructed 3D-dose showed a less than 1.4\% difference for the CAX-dose and at least a 98.3\% gamma-passing-rate (2\%2 mm) for the peripheral dose. Distorted dose distributions were observed in the measurement with the moving phantom. The comparison between the measured and the reconstructed 4D-dose without considering temporal information failed the gamma-evaluation for most cases. In contrast, when temporal information was considered, the dose distortion phenomena were successfully represented in the reconstructed dose (97.6\%-99.7\% gamma-passing rate). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method considered uncertainties of the beam delivery system, the interfractional- and intrafractional-motion, and the interplay effect. The experimental validation demonstrates that this method is practical and accurate for online or offline SBRT patient dose verification",

abstract="The purpose of this study was to compare daily couch shifts after prostate localization between megavoltage CT (MVCT, Hi-ART TomoTherapy) and b-mode ultrasound (BAT system). Nine hundred and thirteen couch shifts from 22 consecutive patients treated using MVCT localization were compared to 853 shifts from 23 randomly selected patients treated using b-mode ultrasound prostate localization. Shifts were made in three principal axes based on prostate position after comparing daily images to the initial planning CT. Mean shift for each axis and the shift variability both between and within individual subjects were calculated. Variability was higher for BAT compared to MVCT for vertical and cranial-caudal (CC) shifts (p=0.0084 and 0.01037, respectively), while lateral shifts were significantly greater for MVCT. For each individual, the pairwise correlations between shifts in different axes were calculated. Among all the groups and pairings, only the pairing of vertical and cranial/caudal adjustments in BAT-localized patients showed significant evidence of correlation after adjustment for multiple pairwise comparisons (p=0.0006). When compared to MVCT, the use of BAT for prostate localization results in greater variability of positional adjustments in vertical and CC directions. This likely reflects differences in the ability to precisely align b-mode ultrasound contours to KVCT images, as well as prostate excursion in vertical and CC direction caused by the ultrasound probe. These considerations need to be made when defining treatment volumes, and argue for the use of less disruptive techniques for daily prostate localization",

abstract="PURPOSE: Traditionally, portal images have been used for verification of patient setup. More recently, direct prostate localization using ultrasound imaging has become available. The aim of this study was to use both modalities to measure daily setup error and prostate organ motion and their respective contributions to the overall uncertainty of prostate target localization. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-five patients treated for prostate cancer with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) between February 6 and July 2, 2001 underwent daily B-mode acquisition and targeting (BAT) ultrasound localization and weekly orthogonal portal imaging. RESULTS: A total of 243 pairs of orthogonal portal films and the corresponding daily BAT images were reviewed. The mean shift +/- standard deviation in the right-left (RL), AP, and superinferior (SI) directions was 0.035 +/- 2.8 mm, -0.23 +/- 3.0 mm, and -0.013 +/- 2.0 mm, respectively, for portal films and -0.82 +/- 3.2 mm, -1.4 +/- 6.4 mm and -1.7 +/- 6.4 mm, respectively, for BAT images taken on the same day as the portal films. The mean prostate organ motion measurements were -0.89 +/- 3.3 mm (RL), -1.3 +/- 5.7 mm (AP), and -1.6 +/- 6.4 mm (SI). Without BAT localization, organ motion would have caused the clinical target volume to move outside the planning target volume margin in 23.3-41.8\% of the treatments. Margins necessary to achieve complete coverage of the clinical target volume > 95\% of the time without BAT would have been 5.3, 10.4 and 10.4 mm in the RL, AP, and SI dimensions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Prostate organ motion appears to predominate over setup error as the major component of variation in target localization. Without the use of BAT ultrasound prostate imaging, misses of the prostate can occur in a high percentage of treatments, despite patient setup verification with portal images. Relatively large planning target volume margins in the AP and SI dimensions may be necessary to overcome this",

Intratreatment intervention was simulated assuming conditions of (1) continuous tracking, and (2) a 3-mm threshold for position correction. RESULTS: For skin-based setup without and with inclusion of intrafraction motion, prostate treatments would have required average margins of 8.0, 7.3, and 10.0 mm and 8.2, 10.2, and 12.5 mm, about the left-right, anterior-posterior, and cranial-caudal directions, respectively. Positioning by prostate markers at the start of the treatment fraction reduced these values to 1.8, 5.8, and 7.1 mm, respectively. Interbeam adjustment further reduced margins to an average of 1.4, 2.3, and 1.8 mm. Intrabeam adjustment yielded margins of 1.3, 1.5, and 1.5 mm, respectively. CONCLUSION: Significant reductions in margins might be achieved by repositioning the patient before each beam, either radiographically or electromagnetically. However, 2 of the 11 patients would have benefited from continuous target tracking and threshold-based intervention",

abstract="For prostate cancer patients, online image-guided (IG) radiotherapy has been widely used in clinic to correct the translational inter-fractional motion at each treatment fraction. For uncertainties that cannot be corrected online, such as rotation and deformation of the target volume, margins are still required to be added to the clinical target volume (CTV) for the treatment planning. Offline adaptive radiotherapy has been implemented to optimize the treatment for each individual patient based on the measurements at early stages of treatment process. It has been shown that offline adaptive radiotherapy can effectively reduce the required margin. Recently a hybrid strategy of offline adaptive replanning and online IG was proposed and the geometric evaluation was performed. It was found that the planning margins can further be reduced by 1-2 mm compared to online IG only strategy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the dosimetric benefits of such a hybrid strategy on the target and organs at risk. A total of 420 repeated helical computed tomography scans from 28 patients were included in the study. Both low-risk patients (LRP, CTV = prostate) and intermediate-risk patients (IRP, CTV = prostate + seminal vesicles, SV) were included in the simulation. Two registration methods, based on center-of-mass shift of prostate only and prostate plus SV, were performed for IRP. The intensity-modulated radiotherapy was used in the simulation. Criteria on both cumulative and fractional doses were evaluated. Furthermore, the geometric evaluation was extended to investigate the optimal number of fractions necessary to construct the internal target volume (ITV) for the hybrid strategy. The dosimetric margin improvement was smaller than its geometric counterpart and was in the range of 0-1 mm. The optimal number of fractions necessary for the ITV construction is 2 for LRPs and 3-4 for IRPs in a hypofractionation protocol. A new cumulative index of target volume was proposed for the evaluation of adaptive radiotherapy strategies, and it was found that it had the advantages over other indices in evaluating different adaptive radiotherapy strategies",

abstract="Purpose: To analyze the relationship between lung motion and skin surface motion during respiration, determine the uncertainties and variability of such a relationship, and assess the potential of reducing internal target margin for gated radiotherapy.Methods and materials: Three healthy volunteers and four lung cancer patients were recruited in a prospective imaging study using MRI to track the internal lung and external skin motion during breathing. The relationship between the lung and skin motion was modeled using linear regression analysis. The slope of the linear fit and its confidence interval were analyzed for different lung locations, skin surface locations, and breathing patterns from separate imaging sessions. The margins of the internal target volume were calculated based on the residual lung motion during gating and its uncertainties from multiple treatment fractions for the gated treatment.Results: The slope and confidence interval of the linear regression from the motion analysis were uniquely defined by the locations of the lung, skin surface, and breathing patterns. Statistically significant differences were observed among individuals and between different times of measurement. The normal free-breathing motion averaged from all volunteer and patient data was 13.4 {\backslash}pm 7.4 mm along the superior-inferior (SI) direction and 6.9 {\backslash}pm 2.6 mm along the anterior-posterior (AP) direction. With simulated respiratory gating, the average margin reduction was 5.5 {\backslash}pm 4.8 mm and 1.6 {\backslash}pm 1.0 mm, respectively, along the SI and AP directions (or 36\% {\backslash}pm 15\% and 25\% {\backslash}pm 14\%, respectively, relative to free-breathing motion).Conclusion: Because respiratory movement is rather complex, the relationship between the lung and skin surface motion is affected by many anatomic and physiologic factors. The reduction of internal target margin and efficacy of the free-breathing gating technique should be assessed for individual cases.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To assess three-dimensional tumor motion caused by respiration and internal target volume (ITV) for radiotherapy of lung cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Respiration-induced tumor motion was analyzed for 166 tumors from 152 lung cancer patients, 57.2\% of whom had Stage III or IV non-small-cell lung cancer. All patients underwent four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) during normal breathing before treatment. The expiratory phase of 4DCT images was used as the reference set to delineate gross tumor volume (GTV). Gross tumor volumes on other respiratory phases and resulting ITVs were determined using rigid-body registration of 4DCT images. The association of GTV motion with various clinical and anatomic factors was analyzed statistically. RESULTS: The proportions of tumors that moved >0.5 cm along the superior-inferior (SI), lateral, and anterior-posterior (AP) axes during normal breathing were 39.2\%, 1.8\%, and 5.4\%, respectively. For 95\% of the tumors, the magnitude of motion was less than 1.34 cm, 0.40 cm, and 0.59 cm along the SI, lateral, and AP directions. The principal component of tumor motion was in the SI direction, with only 10.8\% of tumors moving >1.0 cm. The tumor motion was found to be associated with diaphragm motion, the SI tumor location in the lung, size of the GTV, and disease T stage. CONCLUSIONS: Lung tumor motion is primarily driven by diaphragm motion. The motion of locally advanced lung tumors is unlikely to exceed 1.0 cm during quiet normal breathing except for small lesions located in the lower half of the lung",

abstract="Respiratory motion has been considered a clinical challenge for lung tumor treatments due to target motion. In this study, we aimed to perform an experimental evaluation based on dynamic phantoms using MLC-based beam tracking. TrackBeam, a prototype real-time beam tracking system, has been assembled and evaluated in our clinic. TrackBeam includes an orthogonal dual-layer micro multi-leaf collimator (DmMLC), an on-board mega-voltage (MV) portal imaging device, and an image processing workstation. With a fiducial marker implanted in a moving target, the on-board imaging device can capture the motion. The TrackBeam workstation processes the online MV fluence and detects and predicts tumor motion. The DmMLC system then dynamically repositions each leaf to form new beam apertures based on the movement of the fiducial marker. In this study, a dynamic phantom was used for the measurements. Three delivery patterns were evaluated for dosimetric verification based on radiographic films: no-motion-lung-tumor (NMLT), three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT), and four-dimensional tracking radiotherapy (4DTRT). The displacement between the DmMLC dynamic beam isocenter and the fiducial marker was in the range of 0.5 mm to 1.5 mm. With radiographic film analysis, the planar dose histogram difference between 3DCRT and NLMT was 48.6\% and 38.0\% with dose difference tolerances of 10\% and 20\%. The planar dose histogram difference between 4DTRT and NLMT was 15.2\% and 4.0\% respectively. Based-on dose volume histogram analysis, 4DTRT reduces the mean dose for the surrounding tissue from 35.4 Gy to 19.5 Gy, reduces the relative volume of the total lung from 28\% to 18\% at V20, and reduces the amount of dose from 35.2 Gy to 15.0 Gy at D20. The experimental results show that MLC-based real-time beam tracking delivery provides a potential solution to respiratory motion control. Beam tracking delivers a highly conformal dose to a moving target, while sparing surrounding normal tissue",

abstract="Purpose: To evaluate the setup accuracy that can be achieved with a novel noninvasive patient fixation technique based on a body cast attached to a recently developed stereotactic body frame during fractionated extracranial stereotactic radiotherapy.Methods and Materials: Thirty-one CT studies (>= 20 slices, thickness: 3 mm) from 5 patients who were immobilized in a body cast attached to a stereotactic body frame for treatment of paramedullary tumors in the thoracic or lumbar spine were evaluated with respect to setup accuracy. The immobilization device consisted of a custom-made wrap-around body cast that extended from the neck to the thighs and a separate head mask, both made from Scotchcast. Each CT study was performed immediately before or after every second or third actual treatment fraction without repositioning the patient between CT and treatment. The stereotactic localization system was mounted and the isocenter as initially located stereotactically was marked with fiducials for each CT study. Deviation of the treated isocenter as compared to the planned position was measured in all three dimensions.Results: The immobilization device can be easily handled, attached to and removed from the stereotactic frame and thus enables treatment of multiple patients with the same stereotactic frame each day.

abstract="The characteristic Bragg peak of protons or heavy ions provides a good localization of dose in three dimensions. Through their ability to deliver laterally and distally shaped homogenous fields, protons have been shown to be a precise and practical method for delivering highly conformal radiotherapy. However, in an analogous manner to intensity modulation for photons, protons can be used to construct dose distributions through the application of many individually inhomogeneous fields, but with the localization of dose in the Bragg peak providing the possibility of modulating intensity within each field in two or three dimensions. We describe four different methods of intensity modulation for protons and describe how these have been implemented in an existing proton planning system. As a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of these methods, each has been applied to an example case using a variety of field combinations. Dose-volume histogram analysis of the resulting dose distributions shows that when large numbers of fields are used, all techniques exhibit both good target homogeneity and sparing of neighbouring critical structures, with little difference between the four techniques being discerned. As the number of fields is decreased, however, only a full 3D modulation of individual Bragg peaks can preserve both target coverage and sparing of normal tissues. We conclude that the 3D method provides the greatest flexibility for constructing conformal doses in challenging situations, but that when large numbers of beam ports are available, little advantage may be gained from the additional modulation of intensity in depth",

abstract="In this paper, we report on the clinical application of fully automated three-dimensional intensity modulated proton therapy, as applied to a 34-year-old patient presenting with a thoracic chordoma. Due to the anatomically challenging position of the lesion, a three-field technique was adopted in which fields incident through the lungs and heart, as well as beams directed directly at the spinal cord, could be avoided. A homogeneous target dose and sparing of the spinal cord was achieved through field patching and computer optimization of the 3D fluence of each field. Sensitivity of the resultant plan to delivery and calculational errors was determined through both the assessment of the potential effects of range and patient setup errors, and by the application of Monte Carlo dose calculation methods. Ionization chamber profile measurements and 2D dosimetry using a scintillator/CCD camera arrangement were performed to verify the calculated fields in water. Modeling of a 10\% overshoot of proton range showed that the maximum dose to the spinal cord remained unchanged, but setup error analysis showed that dose homogeneity in the target volume could be sensitive to offsets in the AP direction. No significant difference between the MC and analytic dose calculations was found and the measured dosimetry for all fields was accurate to 3\% for all measured points. Over the course of the treatment, a setup accuracy of +/-4 mm (2 s.d.) could be achieved, with a mean offset in the AP direction of 0.1 mm. Inhalation/exhalation CT scans indicated that organ motion in the region of the target volume was negligible. We conclude that 3D IMPT plans can be applied clinically and safely without modification to our existing delivery system. However, analysis of the calculated intensity matrices should be performed to assess the practicality, or otherwise, of the plan",

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate, using comparative treatment planning, the potential improvements that could result through the use of intensity-modulated photons (intensity-modulated radiation therapy [IMRT]) and protons for the locoregional treatment of complex-target breast cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using CT data from a breast cancer patient, treatment plans were computed using ``standard'' photon/electron, IMRT, and forward-planned proton techniques. A dose of 50 Gy was prescribed to the target volume consisting of the involved breast, internal mammary, supraclavicular, and axillary nodes. The standard plan was designed using 6-MV X-ray beams to the breast, axillary, and supraclavicular areas and a mixture of 6-MV X-rays and 12-MeV electrons for the internal mammary nodes. Two IMRT (IMX1 and IMX2) plans were calculated for nine evenly spaced beams using dose-volume constraints to the organs at risk. For plan IMX1, precedence was given to optimizing the reduction in lung and heart dose while preserving target dose homogeneity. For plan IMX2, an increased precedence was given to the lungs, heart, and contralateral breast to further reduce doses to these organs and to study the effect on target coverage. The proton plan consisted of two oblique, energy-modulated fields. Target dose homogeneity and the doses to neighboring organs were both considered when comparing the different plans. RESULTS: For the standard plan, dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of the target volumes showed severe dose heterogeneity, whereas target coverage for the IMRT and proton plans was comparable. Lung DVHs for the standard and IMRT plans were also comparable, while the proton plan showed the best sparing over all dose levels. Mean doses to the ipsilateral lung for the three plans were found to be 17 Gy, 15 Gy, and 13 Gy for the standard, IMRT, and proton plans, respectively. For the heart, the IMRT plan delivered the highest mean dose (16 Gy), reflecting the extra dose delivered through this organ to spare the lungs. This was reduced somewhat by the standard plan (15 Gy), with the best sparing being provided by the proton plan (6 Gy). When the IMRT plan was reoptimized with an increased precedence to the normal tissues, the mean doses to all neighboring organs at risk could be reduced, but only at the cost of substantial target dose heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with the standard plan, IMRT photons have the potential to greatly improve the target dose homogeneity with only a small increase in the doses delivered to the neighboring critical structures. However, when attempting to further reduce doses to the critical structures, substantial loss of target dose homogeneity was found. In conclusion, only the two-field, energy-modulated proton plan had the potential to preserve target dose homogeneity while simultaneously minimizing the dose delivered to both lungs, heart, and the contralateral breast",

abstract="Simple tools for studying the effects of inter-fraction and inter-field motions on intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) plans have been developed, and have been applied to both 3D and distal edge tracking (DET) IMPT plans. For the inter-fraction motion, we have investigated the effects of misaligned density heterogeneities, whereas for the inter-field motion analysis, the effects of field misalignment on the plans have been assessed. Inter-fraction motion problems have been analysed using density differentiated error (DDE) distributions, which specifically show the additional problems resulting from misaligned density heterogeneities for proton plans. Likewise, for inter-field motion, we present methods for calculating motion differentiated error (MDE) distributions. DDE and MDE analysis of all plans demonstrate that the 3D approach is generally more robust to both inter-fraction and inter-field motions than the DET approach, but that strong in-field dose gradients can also adversely affect a plan's robustness. An important additional conclusion is that, for certain IMPT plans, even inter-fraction errors cannot necessarily be compensated for by the use of a simple PTV margins, implying that more sophisticated tools need to be developed for uncertainty management and assessment for IMPT treatments at the treatment planning level",

abstract="The effects of calculational uncertainties on 3D and distal edge tracking (DET) intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) treatment plans have been investigated. Dose calculation uncertainties have been assessed by comparing analytical and Monte Carlo dose calculations, and potential range uncertainties by recalculating plans with all CT values modified by +/-3\%. Analysis of the volume of PTV agreeing to within +/-3\% between the two calculations shows that the 3D approach provides significantly improved agreement (87.1 versus 80.3\% of points for the 3D and DET approaches, respectively). For the DET approach, doses in the CTV have also been found to globally change by 5\% as a result of 3\% changes in CT value. When varying the intra-field gradients of the plans a similar trend is seen, but with the more complex plans also being found to be more sensitive to both uncertainties. In conclusion, the DET approach has been found to be relatively sensitive to the calculational errors investigated here. In contrast, the 3D approach appears to be quite robust, unless strong internal gradients are present. Nevertheless, the routine use of uncertainty analysis is advised when assessing all forms of IMPT plans",

abstract="The performance of a next-generation optical computed tomography scanner (OCTOPUS-5X) is characterized in the context of three-dimensional gel dosimetry. Large-volume (2.2 L), muscle-equivalent, radiation-sensitive polymer gel dosimeters (BANG-3) were used. Improvements in scanner design leading to shorter acquisition times are discussed. The spatial resolution, detectable absorbance range, and reproducibility are assessed. An efficient method for calibrating gel dosimeters using the depth-dose relationship is applied, with photon- and electron-based deliveries yielding equivalent results. A procedure involving a preirradiation scan was used to reduce the edge artifacts in reconstructed images, thereby increasing the useful cross-sectional area of the dosimeter by nearly a factor of 2. Dose distributions derived from optical density measurements using the calibration coefficient show good agreement with the treatment planning system simulations and radiographic film measurements. The feasibility of use for motion (four-dimensional) dosimetry is demonstrated on an example comparing dose distributions from static and dynamic delivery of a single-field photon plan. The capability to visualize three-dimensional dose distributions is also illustrated",

abstract="The gamma tool was developed to quantitatively compare dose distributions, either measured or calculated. Before computing gamma, the dose and distance scales of the two distributions, referred to as evaluated and reference, are renormalized by dose and distance criteria, respectively. The renormalization allows the dose distribution comparison to be conducted simultaneously along dose and distance axes. The gamma quantity, calculated independently for each reference point, is the minimum distance in the renormalized multidimensional space between the evaluated distribution and the reference point. The gamma quantity degenerates to the dose-difference and distance-to-agreement tests in shallow and very steep dose gradient regions, respectively. Since being introduced, the gamma quantity has been used by investigators to evaluate dose calculation algorithms, and compare dosimetry measurements. This manuscript examines the gamma distribution behavior in two dimensions and evaluates the gamma distribution in the presence of data noise. Noise in the evaluated distribution causes the gamma distribution to be underestimated relative to the no-noise, condition. Noise in the reference distribution adds noise in the gamma distribution in proportion to the normalized dose noise. In typical clinical use, the fraction of points that exceed 3\% and 3 mm can be extensive, so we typically use 5\% and 2-3 mm in clinical evaluations. For clinical cases, the calculation time is typically 5 minutes for a 1 x 1 mm2 interpolated resolution on an 800 MHz Pentium 4 for a 14.1 x 15.2 cm2 radiographic film",

title="Novel breathing motion model for radiotherapy",
journal="International Journal of Radiation Oncology*Biology*Physics",
year="2005",
abstract="An accurate model of breathing motion under quiet respiration is desirable to obtain the most accurate and conformal dose distributions for mobile lung cancer lesions. On the basis of recent lung motion measurements and the physiologic functioning of the lungs, we have determined that the motion of lung and lung tumor tissues can be modeled as a function of five degrees of freedom, the position of the tissues at a user-specified reference breathing phase, tidal volume and its temporal derivative airflow (tidal volume phase space). Time is an implicit variable in this model.Methods and MaterialsTo test this hypothesis, a mathematical model of motion was developed that described the motion of objects p in the lungs as linear functions of tidal volume and airflow. The position of an object was described relative to its position at the reference tidal volume and zero airflow, and the motion of the object was referenced to this position. Hysteresis behavior was hypothesized to be caused by pressure imbalances in the lung during breathing and was, in this model, a function of airflow. The motion was modeled as independent tidal volume and airflow displacement vectors, with the position of the object at time t equal to the vector sum where and were displacement vectors with magnitudes approximated by linear functions of the tidal volume and airflow. To test this model, we analyzed five-dimensional CT scans (CT scans acquired with simultaneous real-time monitoring of the tidal volume) of 4 patients. The scans were acquired throughout the lungs, but the trajectories were analyzed in the couch positions near the diaphragm. A template-matching algorithm was implemented to identify the positions of the points throughout the 15 scans. In total, 76 points throughout the 4 patients were tracked. The lateral motion of these points was minimal; thus, the model was described in two spatial dimensions, with a total of six parameters necessary to describe the 30 degrees of freedom inherent in the 15 positions.ResultsFor the 76 evaluated points, the average discrepancy (the distance between the measured and prediction positions) of the 15 locations for each tracked point was 0.75 {\backslash}pm 0.25 mm, with an average maximal discrepancy of 1.55 {\backslash}pm 0.54 mm. The average discrepancy was also tabulated as a fraction of the breathing motion. Discrepancies of ConclusionThe motion tracking algorithms are being improved and automated to provide more motion data to test the models. This may allow a measurement of the motion-fitting parameters throughout the lungs. If the parameters vary smoothly, interpolation may be possible, yielding a continuous mathematical model of the breathing motion throughout the lungs. The utility of the model will depend on its stability as a function of time. If the model is only robust during the measurement session, it may be useful for determining lung function. If it is robust for weeks, it may be useful for treatment planning and gating of lung treatments. The use of tidal volume phase space for characterizing breathing motion appears to have provided, for the first time, the potential for a patient-specific mathematical model of breathing motion",

abstract="Proton therapy offers the potential for excellent dose conformity and reduction in integral dose. The superior dose distribution is, however, much more sensitive to changes in radiological depths along the beam path than for photon fields. Respiratory motion can cause such changes for treatments sites like lung, liver, and mediastinum and thus affect the proton dose distribution significantly. We have implemented and commissioned a respiratory-gated system for range-modulated treatment fields. The gating system was designed to ensure that each gate always contains complete modulation cycles so that for any beam segment the delivered dose has the planned depth-dose distribution. Measurements have been made to estimate the time delays for the various components of the system. The total delay between the actual motion and the beam on/off control is in the range of 65-195 ms. Time-resolved dose measurements and film tests were also conducted to examine the overall gating effect",

pages="1077--1099",
abstract="Delineating regions of interest (ROIs) on each phase of four-dimensional (4D) computed tomography (CT) images is an essential step for 4D radiotherapy. The requirement of manual phase-by-phase contouring prohibits the routine use of 4D radiotherapy. This paper develops an automatic re-contouring algorithm that combines techniques of deformable registration and surface construction. ROIs are manually contoured slice-by-slice in the reference phase image. A reference surface is constructed based on these reference contours using a triangulated surface construction technique. The deformable registration technique provides the voxel-to-voxel mapping between the reference phase and the test phase. The vertices of the reference surface are displaced in accordance with the deformation map, resulting in a deformed surface. The new contours are reconstructed by cutting the deformed surface slice-by-slice along the transversal, sagittal or coronal direction. Since both the inputs and outputs of our automatic re-contouring algorithm are contours, it is relatively easy to cope with any treatment planning system. We tested our automatic re-contouring algorithm using a deformable phantom and 4D CT images of six lung cancer patients. The proposed algorithm is validated by visual inspections and quantitative comparisons of the automatic re-contours with both the gold standard segmentations and the manual contours. Based on the automatic delineated ROIs, changes of tumour and sensitive structures during respiration are quantitatively analysed. This algorithm could also be used to re-contour daily images for treatment evaluation and adaptive radiotherapy",

abstract="Respiratory motion can cause significant dose delivery errors in conformal radiation therapy for thoracic and upper abdominal tumors. Four-dimensional computed tomography (4D CT) has been proposed to provide the image data necessary to model tumor motion and consequently reduce these errors. The purpose of this work was to compare 4D CT reconstruction methods using amplitude sorting and phase angle sorting. A 16-slice CT scanner was operated in cine mode to acquire 25 scans consecutively at each couch position through the thorax. The patient underwent synchronized external respiratory measurements. The scans were sorted into 12 phases based, respectively, on the amplitude and direction (inhalation or exhalation) or on the phase angle (0-360 degrees) of the external respiratory signal. With the assumption that lung motion is largely proportional to the measured respiratory amplitude, the variation in amplitude corresponds to the variation in motion for each phase. A smaller variation in amplitude would associate with an improved reconstructed image. Air content, defined as the amount of air within the lungs, bronchi, and trachea in a 16-slice CT segment and used by our group as a surrogate for internal motion, was correlated to the respiratory amplitude and phase angle throughout the lungs. For the 35 patients who underwent quiet breathing, images (similar to those used for treatment planning) and animations (used to display respiratory motion) generated using amplitude sorting displayed fewer reconstruction artifacts than those generated using phase angle sorting. The variations in respiratory amplitude were significantly smaller (P < 0.001) with amplitude sorting than those with phase angle sorting. The subdivision of the breathing cycle into more (finer) phases improved the consistency in respiratory amplitude for amplitude sorting, but not for phase angle sorting. For 33 of the 35 patients, the air content showed significantly improved (P < 0.001) correlation with the respiratory amplitude than with the phase angle, suggesting a stronger relationship between internal motion and amplitude. Overall, amplitude sorting performed better than phase angle sorting for 33 of the 35 patients and equally well for two patients who were immobilized with a stereotactic body frame and an abdominal compression plate",

abstract="Intra-fraction target motion hits the fundamental basis of IMRT where precise target positions are assumed. Real-time motion compensation is necessary to ensure that the same dose is delivered as planned. Strategies for conventional IMRT delivery for moving targets by dynamic multi-leaf collimators (MLC) tracking are well published. Binary MLC-based IMRT,such as TomoTherapy , requires synchronized motion of MLC, the couch and the gantry, which suggests a unique motion management strategy. Thanks to it sultra-fast leaf response and fast projection rate, real-time motion compensation for binary MLC-based IMRT is feasible. Topotherapy is a new IMRT delivery technique, which can be implemented in commercial helical TomoTherapy machines using only fixed gantry positions. In this paper, we present a novel approach for TopoTherapy delivery that adjusts for moving targets without additional hardware and control requirement. This technique uses the planned leaf sequence but rearranges the projection and leaf indices. It does not involve time-consuming operations, such as reoptimization. Unlike gating or breath hold-based methods, this technique can achieve nearly a 100\% duty cycle with little breath control. Unlike dynamic MLC-based tracking methods, this technique requires neither the whole target motion trajectory nor the velocity of target motion. Instead, it only requires instantaneous target positions, which greatly simplifies the system implementation. Extensive simulations, including the worst-case scenarios, validated the presented technique to be applicable to relatively regular or mild irregular respirations. The delivered dose conforms well to the target, and significant margin reduction can be achieved provided that accurate, real-time tumor localization is available",

abstract="TomoTherapy delivery is controlled by a planned, projection-wised leaf sequence (sinogram) that is optimized during treatment planning. In this paper, we developed a software solution for real-time motion compensation that delivers helical TomoTherapy plans without modifying the hardware and workflow of the TomoTherapy delivery system. Unlike the dynamic MLC-based method, our technique only requires instantaneous tumor positions, which greatly simplifies its implementation. This technique re-uses the planned sinogram by shuffling its projections and leaf sequences. In order to compensate for longitudinal tumor motion in real-time, instead of sequential execution of the planned sinogram, the projections are executed out of order. That is, we may choose a past or future projection of the planned sinogram rather than the current projection depending on tumor motion, so that the planned radiation source position of the chosen projection is the same as the radiation source position at the current delivery time in the tumor reference frame. The transverse tumor motion is further compensated for by shifting and scaling the leaf open time of the chosen projection. We tested different planned sinograms that were optimized using various synthetic tumor/OAR configurations, as well as planned sinogram of a lung cancer patient, all with zero motion margins. Various TomoTherapy machine parameters and both regular and irregular respiratory traces were used in calculations. By applying the motion-adaptive delivery (MAD) technique, the delivered dose matched the planned dose very well in both DVH and dose profiles. As for the regular and minor irregular respiration, the dose errors were well below 3 mm and 3\% criteria. No hot and cold spots were noticeable. For irregular respiration with some missing breathing cycles, this method demonstrates the capability for motion margin reduction",

abstract="IMRT delivery follows a planned leaf sequence, which is optimized before treatment delivery. However, it is hard to model real-time variations, such as respiration, in the planning procedure. In this paper, we propose a negative feedback system of IMRT delivery that incorporates real-time optimization to account for intra-fraction motion. Specifically, we developed a feasible workflow of real-time motion-adaptive-optimization (MAO) for TomoTherapy delivery. TomoTherapy delivery is characterized by thousands of projections with a fast projection rate and ultra-fast binary leaf motion. The technique of MAO-guided delivery calculates (i) the motion-encoded dose that has been delivered up to any given projection during the delivery and (ii) the future dose that will be delivered based on the estimated motion probability and future fluence map. These two pieces of information are then used to optimize the leaf open time of the upcoming projection right before its delivery. It consists of several real-time procedures, including 'motion detection and prediction', 'delivered dose accumulation', 'future dose estimation' and 'projection optimization'. Real-time MAO requires that all procedures are executed in time less than the duration of a projection. We implemented and tested this technique using a TomoTherapy research system. The MAO calculation took about 100 ms per projection. We calculated and compared MAO-guided delivery with two other types of delivery, motion-without-compensation delivery (MD) and static delivery (SD), using simulated 1D cases, real TomoTherapy plans and the motion traces from clinical lung and prostate patients. The results showed that the proposed technique effectively compensated for motion errors of all test cases. Dose distributions and DVHs of MAO-guided delivery approached those of SD, for regular and irregular respiration with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 3 cm, and for medium and large prostate motions. The results conceptually proved that the proposed method is applicable for real-time motion compensation in TomoTherapy delivery. Extension of the method to real-time adaptive radiation therapy (ART) that compensates for all kinds of delivery errors was proposed. Further validation and clinical implementation is underway",

Treatment plans for different target geometries have been optimized. They have been delivered using scanned carbon ions with beam tracking (BT) and real-time dose compensation combined with beam tracking (RDBT), respectively. Target motion was introduced by a rotating table. Dose distributions were assessed by ionization chamber measurements and dose reconstructions. These distributions have been compared to stationary delivery for BT as well as RDBT. Additionally simulations have been performed to investigate the dependence of delivered dose distributions on varying motion starting phases for BT and RDBT, respectively.Results: Average measured dose differences between static delivery and motion influenced delivery could be reduced from 27-68 mGy when BT was used to 12-37 mGy when RDBT was used. Nominal dose was 1000 mGy. Simulated dose deliveries showed improvements in dose delivery and robustness against varying starting motion phases when RDBT was used.Conclusions: A real-time dose compensation functionality extending the existing beam tracking functionality has been implemented and verified by measurements. Measurements and simulated dose deliveries show that real-time dose compensation can substantially improve delivered dose distributions for large rotational target motion compared to beam tracking alone",

abstract="The purpose of this study is to develop a 4D inverse planning strategy capable of controlling the appearance of the implanted fiducial(s) in segmented IMRT fields for cine MV or combined MV/kV image-guided IMRT. This work is focused on enhancing the visibility of the implanted fiducial(s) in 4D IMRT inverse planning, whose goal is to derive a set of time-resolved (or phase-tagged) MLC segments to cater for the motion of the patient anatomy extracted from the emerging 4D images. The task is to optimize the shapes and weights of all the segments for each incident beam, with the fiducial(s) being forced/encouraged to be inside the segmented fields. The system is modeled by a quadratic objective function with inclusion of a hard/soft constraint characterizing the authors' level of preference for the fiducial(s) to be included in the segmented fields. A simulated annealing algorithm is employed to optimize the system. The proposed technique is demonstrated using two clinical cases. A segment-based inverse planning framework for 4D radiation therapy, capable of providing tempospatially optimized IMRT plans, has been established. Furthermore, using the described 4D optimization approach, it is demonstrated that the MLC blockage of the implanted fiducial(s) during the segmented delivery is avoided without severely compromising the final dose distribution. The visibility of implanted fiducials in 4D IMRT can be improved without significantly deteriorating final dose distribution. This is a foundation for the authors to use cine MV or combined MV/KV to effectively guide the 4D IMRT delivery",

abstract="PURPOSE: To develop a 4D volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) inverse planning framework. METHODS: 4D VMAT inverse planning aims to derive an aperture and weight modulated arc therapy treatment plan that optimizes the accumulated dose distribution from all gantry angles and breathing phases. Under an assumption that the gantry rotation and patient breathing are synchronized (i.e., there is a functional relationship between the phase of the patient breathing cycle and the beam angle), the authors compute the contribution from different respiration phases through the registration of the phased CT images. The accumulative dose distribution is optimized by iteratively adjusting the aperture shape and weight of each beam through the minimization of the planning objective function. For comparison, traditional 3D VMAT plans are also performed for the two cases and the performance of the proposed technique is demonstrated. RESULTS: A framework for 4D VMAT inverse planning has been proposed. With the consideration of the extra dimension of time in VMAT, a tighter target margin can be achieved with a full duty cycle, which is otherwise not achievable simultaneously by either 3D VMAT optimization or gated VMAT. CONCLUSIONS: The 4D VMAT planning formulism proposed here provides useful insight on how the ``time'' dimension can be exploited in rotational arc therapy to maximally compensate for the intrafraction organ motion",

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate the stability of the prostate during stereotactic radiation therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven patients underwent placement of three fiducial markers into the prostate as part of a pilot study of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. Portal images before and subsequent to 227 radiotherapy fractions were analyzed for prostate movement. Six patients also underwent localizing radiographs at 6-min intervals for 24 min. Relative motion of the bony landmarks and prostate markers was calculated. RESULTS: Analysis of portal images revealed the undirected average prostate movement of 2.0 mm (superior/inferior), 1.9 mm (anterior/posterior), and 1.4 mm (right/left) with maximum standard deviation (SD) of 2.0. Analysis of radiographs at 6-min intervals showed the greatest undirected average prostate motion between 0-6 min; 1.5 mm (superior/inferior), 1.4 mm (anterior/posterior), and 0.4 mm (right/left). Beyond 6 min, movements decreased to 0.4, 0.9, and 0.8 mm, respectively. Bony landmark motion was 0.9 mm (superior/inferior), 0.9 mm (anterior/posterior), and 0.4 mm (right/left) between 0-6 min. Beyond 6 min, motion decreased to less than 0.5 mm in any direction. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic prostate radiotherapy, utilizing fiducial marker localization, resulted in average intrafractional prostate movement of 2.0 mm or less. Most patient and organ movement occurs early and a settling-in period is advisable before treatment",

abstract="We report on initial patient studies to evaluate the performance of a commercial respiratory gating radiotherapy system. The system uses a breathing monitor, consisting of a video camera and passive infrared reflective markers placed on the patient's thorax, to synchronize radiation from a linear accelerator with the patient's breathing cycle. Six patients receiving treatment for lung cancer participated in a study of system characteristics during treatment simulation with fluoroscopy. Breathing synchronized fluoroscopy was performed initially without instruction, followed by fluoroscopy with recorded verbal instruction (i.e., when to inhale and exhale) with the tempo matched to the patient's normal breathing period. Patients tended to inhale more consistently when given instruction, as assessed by an external marker movement. This resulted in smaller variation in expiration and inspiration marker positions relative to total excursion, thereby permitting more precise gating tolerances at those parts of the breathing cycle. Breathing instruction also reduced the fraction of session times having irregular breathing as measured by the system software, thereby potentially increasing the accelerator duty factor and decreasing treatment times. Fluoroscopy studies showed external monitor movement to correlate well with that of the diaphragm in four patients, whereas time delays of up to 0.7 s in diaphragm movement were observed in two patients with impaired lung function. From fluoroscopic observations, average patient diaphragm excursion was reduced from 1.4 cm (range 0.7-2.1 cm) without gating and without breathing instruction, to 0.3 cm (range 0.2-0.5 cm) with instruction and with gating tolerances set for treatment at expiration for 25\% of the breathing cycle. Patients expressed no difficulty with following instruction for the duration of a session. We conclude that the external monitor accurately predicts internal respiratory motion in most cases; however, it may be important to check with fluoroscopy for possible time delays in patients with impaired lung function. Furthermore, we observe that verbal instruction can improve breathing regularity, thus improving the performance of gated treatments with this system",

abstract="PURPOSE: To quantify the three-dimensional intrafractional prostate motion over typical treatment time intervals with cine-magnetic resonance imaging (cine MRI) studies. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-two patients with prostate cancer were scanned supine in an alpha cradle cast using cine MRI. Twenty sequential slices were acquired in the sagittal and axial planes through the center of the prostate. Each scan took approximately 9 min. The posterior, lateral, and superior edges of the prostate were tracked on each frame relative to the initial prostate position, and the size and duration of each displacement was recorded. RESULTS: The prostate displacements were (mean +/- SD): 0.2 +/- 2.9 mm, 0.0 +/- 3.4 mm, and 0.0 +/- 1.5 mm in the anterior-posterior, superior-inferior, and medial-lateral dimensions respectively. The prostate motion appeared to have been driven by peristalsis in the rectum. Large displacements of the prostate (up to 1.2 cm) moved the prostate both anteriorly and superiorly and in some cases compressed the organ. For such motions, the prostate did not stay displaced, but moved back to its original position. To account for the dosimetric consequences of the motion, we also calculated the time-averaged displacement to be approximately 1 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Cine MRI can be used to measure intrafractional prostate motion. Although intrafractional prostate motions occur, their effects are negligible compared to interfractional motion and setup error. No adjustment in margin is necessary for three-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated radiation therapy",

abstract="In this paper, we deal with the effects of interfractional organ motion during radiation therapy. We consider two problems: first, treatment plan evaluation in the presence of motion, and second, the incorporation of organ motion into IMRT optimization. Concerning treatment plan evaluation, we face the problem that the delivered dose cannot be predicted with certainty at the time of treatment planning but is associated with uncertainties. We present a method to simulate stochastic properties of the dose distribution. This provides the treatment planner with information about motion-related risks of different plans and may support the decision for or against a treatment plan. This information includes the display of probabilities of individual voxels to receive doses from a therapeutical interval or above critical levels, as well as a diagram that shows the variability of the dose volume histogram. Concerning the incorporation of organ motion into IMRT planning, we further analyse the approach of inverse planning based on probability distributions of possible patient geometries. We consider three different sources of uncertainty, namely uncertainty about the amplitude of motion, a systematic error and a random error. We analyse the impact of these sources of uncertainty on the optimized treatment plans for prostate cancer",

abstract="PURPOSE: To determine how frequently (1) tumor motion and (2) the spatial relationship between tumor and respiratory surrogate markers change during a treatment fraction in lung and pancreas cancer patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A Cyberknife Synchrony system radiographically localized the tumor and simultaneously tracked three respiratory surrogate markers fixed to a form-fitting vest. Data in 55 lung and 29 pancreas fractions were divided into successive 10-min blocks. Mean tumor positions and tumor position distributions were compared across 10-min blocks of data. Treatment margins were calculated from both 10 and 30 min of data. Partial least squares (PLS) regression models of tumor positions as a function of external surrogate marker positions were created from the first 10 min of data in each fraction; the incidence of significant PLS model degradation was used to assess changes in the spatial relationship between tumors and surrogate markers. RESULTS: The absolute change in mean tumor position from first to third 10-min blocks was >5 mm in 13\% and 7\% of lung and pancreas cases, respectively. Superior-inferior and medial-lateral differences in mean tumor position were significantly associated with the lobe of lung. In 61\% and 54\% of lung and pancreas fractions, respectively, margins calculated from 30 min of data were larger than margins calculated from 10 min of data. The change in treatment margin magnitude for superior-inferior motion was >1 mm in 42\% of lung and 45\% of pancreas fractions. Significantly increasing tumor position prediction model error (mean ? standard deviation rates of change of 1.6 ? 2.5 mm per 10 min) over 30 min indicated tumor-surrogate relationship changes in 63\% of fractions. CONCLUSIONS: Both tumor motion and the relationship between tumor and respiratory surrogate displacements change in most treatment fractions for patient in-room time of 30 min.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Estimated cancer mortality statistics were published for the years 2011 and 2012 for the European Union (EU) and its six more populous countries. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using logarithmic Poisson count data joinpoint models and the World Health Organization mortality and population database, we estimated numbers of deaths and age-standardized (world) mortality rates (ASRs) in 2013 from all cancers and selected cancers. RESULTS: The 2013 predicted number of cancer deaths in the EU is 1 314 296 (737 747 men and 576 489 women). Between 2009 and 2013, all cancer ASRs are predicted to fall by 6\% to 140.1/100 000 in men, and by 4\% to 85.3/100 000 in women. The ASRs per 100 000 are 6.6 men and 2.9 women for stomach, 16.7 men and 9.5 women for intestines, 8.0 men and 5.5 women for pancreas, 37.1 men and 13.9 women for lung, 10.5 men for prostate, 14.6 women for breast, and 4.7 for uterine cancer, and 4.2 and 2.6 for leukaemia. Recent trends are favourable except for pancreatic cancer and lung cancer in women. CONCLUSIONS: Favourable trends will continue in 2013. Pancreatic cancer has become the fourth cause of cancer death in both sexes, while in a few years lung cancer will likely become the first cause of cancer mortality in women as well, overtaking breast cancer",

abstract="Intrafraction organ motion can limit the advantage of highly conformal dose techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) due to target position uncertainty. To ensure high accuracy in beam targeting, real-time knowledge of the target location is highly desired throughout the beam delivery process. This knowledge can be gained through imaging of internally implanted radio-opaque markers with fluoroscopic or electronic portal imaging devices (EPID). In the case of MV based images, marker detection can be problematic due to the significantly lower contrast between different materials in comparison to their kV-based counterparts. This work presents a fully automated algorithm capable of detecting implanted metallic markers in both kV and MV images with high consistency. Using prior CT information, the algorithm predefines the volumetric search space without manual region-of-interest (ROI) selection by the user. Depending on the template selected, both spherical and cylindrical markers can be detected. Multiple markers can be simultaneously tracked without indexing confusion. Phantom studies show detection success rates of 100\% for both kV and MV image data. In addition, application of the algorithm to real patient image data results in successful detection of all implanted markers for MV images. Near real-time operational speeds of approximately 10 frames/sec for the detection of five markers in a 1024 x 768 image are accomplished using an ordinary PC workstation",

abstract="BACKGROUND: The 5-year survival of patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma is still unsatisfying. The ESPAC-1 and the CONKO 001 trial proofed that adjuvant chemotherapy improves 5-year survival significantly from approximately 14\% to 21\%. In parallel, investigators from the Virginia Mason Clinic reported a 5-year survival rate of 55\% in a phase II trial evaluating a combination of adjuvant chemotherapy, immunotherapy and external beam radiation (CapRI-scheme). Two other groups confirmed in phase II trials these results to a certain extent. However, these groups reported severe gastrointestinal toxicity (up to 93\% grade 3 or 4 toxicity). In a randomized controlled phase III trial, called CapRI, 110 patients were enrolled from 2004 to 2007 in Germany and Italy to check for reproducibility. Interestingly, much less gastrointestinal toxicity was observed. However, dose-reduction due to haematological side effects had to be performed in nearly all patients. First clinical results are expected for the end of 2009. METHODS/DESIGN: CapRI-2 is an open, controlled, prospective, randomized, multicentre phase II trial with three parallel arms. A de-escalation of the CapRI-scheme will be tested in two different modifications. Patients in study arm A will be treated as outpatients with the complete CapRI-scheme consisting of cisplatin, Interferon alpha-2b and external beam radiation and three cycles of 5-fluorouracil continuous infusion. In study arm B the first de-escalation will be realised by omitting cisplatin. Next, patients in study arm C will additionally not receive external beam radiation. A total of 135 patients with pathologically confirmed R0 or R1 resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma are planned to be enrolled. Primary endpoint is the comparison of the treatment groups with respect to six-month event-free-survival. An event is defined as grade 3 or grade 4 toxicity, objective tumour recurrence, or death. DISCUSSION: The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate de-escalation of the CapRI-scheme. It is hypothesised that removal of cisplatin and radiotherapy will have no significant effect or only a minor impact on the clinical response but result in substantially lower toxicity.

abstract="PURPOSE: Advances in technology allow the creation of complex treatment plans with tightly conforming doses. However, variations in positioning of the organ/patient with respect to treatment beams necessitate the use of an appreciable margin, potentially limiting dose escalation in many patients. To (1) reduce this margin and (2) test the hypothesis that the achievable level of dose escalation is patient dependent, a patient-specific, confidence-limited planning target volume (cl-PTV) was constructed using an adaptive radiotherapy (ART) process for prostate cancer treatment developed in-house. The potential dose escalation achievable with this ART process is quantified for both conformal radiotherapy (CRT) delivery and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) delivery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with organ confined prostate cancer were entered prospectively into an ART process developed in-house. This ART process has been designed to improve accuracy and precision of dose delivery, consequently enhancing dose escalation. In this process, a cl-PTV is constructed for each patient in the second week of treatment based upon on-line portal and CT images acquired during the first week of treatment. The treatment prescription dose, defined as the minimum dose to the cl-PTV, is selected based on predefined dose-volume constraints for rectum/bladder and derived from the pretreatment planning CT image. In addition, the treatment modality (CRT or IMRT) is determined based on the level of dose escalation achievable and the risk of inaccurate targeting. The potential for both dose escalation and the application of IMRT was evaluated by comparing the prescription doses delivered using the ART process, with the cl-PTV, to those in the traditional treatment process, with a conventional generic PTV. In addition, the distributions of potential geometric target underdosing and normal tissue overdosing were also calculated to evaluate the quality of the conventional treatment plans. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty patients have been treated with the ART process. When compared to the treatment dose delivered with the conventional treatment process (generic PTV), an average 5\% (2.5--10\%) more dose could be delivered using the ART process with CRT, and 7.5\% (2.5--15\%) more dose could be delivered with IMRT. Of the 150 patients, 70\% were treated to a minimum cl-PTV dose > or = 77.4 Gy (81.3 Gy ICRU isocenter dose). Dosimetric analysis revealed that 81 Gy to the cl-PTV (or 86.7 Gy ICRU) could be prescribed to at least 50\% of patients if IMRT was applied using the ART process. In contrast, IMRT did not yield an obvious dose escalation gain if patients were treated using the generic PTV. Our results also demonstrate that the cl-PTV is significantly smaller than the conventional generic PTV for most patients, with a mean volume reduction of 24\% (range, 5--43\%). CONCLUSION: These results support our hypothesis that the achievable level of dose escalation using ART is patient dependent. By using the ART process to develop a cl-PTV, one can (1) optimize the dose level, (2) increase the applicability of IMRT, and (3) improve the quality of dose delivery. The ART process provides the foundation to identify a suitable option (CRT or IMRT) for the delivery of a safe treatment and dose escalation. It is now our standard of practice for prostate cancer treatment",

abstract="In ion beam therapy the finite range of the ion beams in tissue and the presence of the Bragg-peak are exploited. Unpredictable changes in the patient`s condition can alter the range of the ion beam in the body. Therefore it is desired to verify the actual ion range during the treatment, preferably in a non-invasive way. Positron emission tomography (PET) has been used successfully to monitor the applied dose distributions. This method however suffers from limited applicability and low detection efficiency. In order to increase the detection efficiency and to decrease the uncertainties, in this study we investigate the possibility to measure secondary charged particles emerging from the patient during irradiation. An initial experimental study to register the particle radiation coming out of a patient phantom during the therapy was performed at the Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Center (HIT) in Germany. A static narrowly-focused beam of carbon ions was directed into a head phantom. The emerging secondary radiation was measured with the position-sensitive Timepix detector outside of the phantom. The detector, developed by the Medipix Collaboration, consists of a silicon sensor bump bonded to a pixelated readout chip (256 {\c{C}}- 256 pixels with 55 {\texttimes}?m pitch). Together with the USB-based readout interface, Timepix can operate as an active nuclear emulsion registering single particles online with 2D-track visualization. In this contribution we measured the signal behind the head phantom and investigated its dependence on the beam energy (corresponding to beam range in water 2?\_``30 cm). Furthermore, the response was measured at four angles between 0 and 90 degrees. At all investigated energies some signal was registered. Its pattern corresponds to ions. Differences in the total amount of signal for different beam energies were observed. The time-structure of the signal is correlated with that of the incoming beam, showing that we register products of prompt processes. Such measurements are less likely to be influenced by biological washout processes than the signal registered by the PET technique, coming from decays of beam-induced radioactive nuclei. This work demonstrates that the Timepix detector is able to register ions emerging from the patient during the treatment by carbon ion beams. In future work it will be investigated which information about the incoming beam can be gained from the analysis of the measured data",

abstract="Dynamic beam delivery techniques are being increasingly used for cancer therapy. Scanning ion beams require extensive and time-demanding quality assurance procedures and beam tuning. Accordingly, fast measurement techniques improving the efficiency of the procedures and accommodating the safety requirements are highly desirable. Major requirements for a detector used for beam-shape measurements are high spatial resolution in two dimensions, reusability, online readout and easy handling. At the Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Facility (Germany), we examined the performance of the RID 256 L flat-panel detector for beam spot measurements. The two-dimensional beam profiles of proton and carbon ion beams measured were compared to measurements with radiographic films at intermediate energies using the index. The difference to the beam width measured with radiographic films of less than 3\% demonstrates sufficient accuracy of ion beam width measurements possible with this detector for both proton and carbon ion beams. The beam shapes were also measured at different beam intensities. At both the highest and lowest energies available at the HIT, no beam spot-shape deformation was found with increasing beam intensities, as long as the boundary of the dynamic range was not exceeded. The signal leak along the readout direction was identified as an undesirable effect. However, due to small amplitudes and static beams, this effect is of minor importance for beam spot measurements. Distortion of results due to detector radiation damage was monitored. No detector radiation damage was observed over the experiments. Moreover, the observed short-time detector response stability (within +/-0.1\%) as well as medium term stability (within 0.5\% in 15 months) was excellent. This flat-panel detector is compact and easy to use. Together with its low weight, this helps to speed up measurement procedures substantially. All these properties make this an ideal detector for the fast, high-resolution imaging of static ion beam spots needed for constancy measurements in daily beam quality assurance and for accelerator tuning. For daily use, radiation damage has to be monitored continuously and corrected for if necessary",

abstract="An automatic three-dimensional non-rigid registration scheme is proposed in this paper and applied to thoracic computed tomography (CT) data of patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). According to the registration scheme, initially anatomical set of points such as the vertebral spine, the ribs, and shoulder blades are automatically segmented slice by slice from the two CT scans of the same patient in order to serve as interpolant points. Based on these extracted features, a rigid-body transformation is then applied to provide a pre-registration of the data. To establish correspondence between the feature points, the novel application of the self-organizing maps (SOMs) is adopted. In particular, the automatic correspondence of the interpolant points is based on the initialization of the Kohonen neural network model capable to identify 500 corresponding pairs of points approximately in the two CT sets. Then, radial basis functions (RBFs) using the shifted log function is subsequently employed for elastic warping of the image volume, using the correspondence between the interpolant points, as obtained in the previous phase. Quantitative and qualitative results are also presented to validate the performance of the proposed elastic registration scheme resulting in an alignment error of 6 mm, on average, over 15 CT paired datasets. Finally, changes of the tumor volume in respect to each reference dataset are estimated for all patients, which indicate inspiration and/or movement of the patient during acquisition of the data. Thus, the practical implementation of this scheme could provide estimations of lung tumor volumes during radiotherapy treatment planning",

abstract="The precise conversion of CT numbers to their electron densities is essential in treatment planning for hadron therapy. Although some conversion methods have already been proposed, it is hard to check the conversion accuracy during practical therapy. We have estimated the CT numbers of real tissues by a calculational method established by Mustafa and Jackson. The relationship between the CT numbers and the electron densities was investigated for various body tissues as well as some tissue-equivalent materials used for a conversion to check the accuracy of the current conversion methods. The result indicates a slight disagreement at the high-CT-number region. A precise estimation of the multiple scattering, nuclear reaction and range straggling of incident particles has been considered as being important to realize higher-level conformal therapy in the future. The relationship between these parameters and the CT numbers was also investigated for tissues and water. The result shows that it is sufficiently practical to replace these parameters for real tissues with those for water by adjusting the density",

abstract="The clinical dose distributions of therapeutic carbon beams, currently used at NIRS HIMAC, are based on in-vitro Human Salivary Gland (HSG) cell survival response and clinical experience from fast neutron radiotherapy. Moderate radiosensitivity of HSG cells is expected to be a typical response of tumours to carbon beams. At first, the biological dose distribution is designed so as to cause a flat biological effect on HSG cells in the spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) region. Then, the entire biological dose distribution is evenly raised in order to attain a RBE (relative biological effectiveness) = 3.0 at a depth where dose-averaged LET (linear energy transfer) is 80 keV/mum. At that point, biological experiments have shown that carbon ions can be expected to have a biological effect identical to fast neutrons, which showed a clinical RBE of 3.0 for fast neutron radiotherapy at NIRS. The resulting clinical dose distribution in this approximation is not dependent on dose level, tumour type or fractionation scheme and thus reduces the unknown parameters in the analysis of the clinical results. The width SOBP and the clinical / physical dose at the center of SOBP specify the dose distribution. The clinical results analysed in terms of TCP were found to show good agreement with the expected RBE value at higher TCP levels. The TCP analysis method was applied for the prospective dose estimation of hypofractionation",

abstract="Pre-treatment patient repositioning in highly conformal image-guided radiation therapy modalities is a prerequisite for reducing setup uncertainties. In Helical Tomotherapy (HT) treatment, a megavoltage CT (MVCT) image is usually acquired to evaluate daily changes in the patient's internal anatomy and setup position. This MVCT image is subsequently compared to the kilovoltage CT (kVCT) study that was used for dosimetric planning, by applying a registration process. This study aims at investigating the expected effect of patient setup correction using the Hi-Art tomotherapy system by employing radiobiological measures such as the biologically effective uniform dose (D) and the complication-free tumor control probability (P(+)). A new module of the Tomotherapy software (TomoTherapy, Inc, Madison, WI) called Planned Adaptive is employed in this study. In this process the delivered dose can be calculated by using the sinogram for each delivered fraction and the registered MVCT image set that corresponds to the patient's position and anatomical distribution for that fraction. In this study, patients treated for lung, pancreas and prostate carcinomas are evaluated by this method. For each cancer type, a Helical Tomotherapy plan was developed. In each cancer case, two dose distributions were calculated using the MVCT image sets before and after the patient setup correction. The fractional dose distributions were added and renormalized to the total number of fractions planned. The dosimetric and radiobiological differences of the dose distributions with and without patient setup correction were calculated. By using common statistical measures of the dose distributions and the P(+) and D concepts and plotting the tissue response probabilities vs. D a more comprehensive comparison was performed based on radiobiological measures. For the lung cancer case, at the clinically prescribed dose levels of the dose distributions, with and without patient setup correction, the complication-free tumor control probabilities, P(+) are 48.5\% and 48.9\% for a D(ITV) of 53.3 Gy. The respective total control probabilities, P(B) are 56.3\% and 56.5\%, whereas the corresponding total complication probabilities, P(I) are 7.9\% and 7.5\%. For the pancreas cancer case, at the prescribed dose levels of the two dose distributions, the P(+) values are 53.7\% and 45.7\% for a D(ITV) of 54.7 Gy and 53.8 Gy, respectively. The respective P(B) values are 53.7\% and 45.8\%, whereas the corresponding P(I) values are {\textasciitilde}0.0\% and 0.1\%. For the prostate cancer case, at the prescribed dose levels of the two dose distributions, the P(+) values are 10.9\% for a D(ITV) of 75.2 Gy and 11.9\% for a D(ITV) of 75.4 Gy, respectively. The respective P(B) values are 14.5\% and 15.3\%, whereas the corresponding P(I) values are 3.6\% and 3.4\%. Our analysis showed that the very good daily patient setup and dose delivery were very close to the intended ones. With the exception of the pancreas cancer case, the deviations observed between the dose distributions with and without patient setup correction were within +/-2\% in terms of P(+). In the radiobiologically optimized dose distributions, the role of patient setup correction using MVCT images could appear to be more important than in the cases of dosimetrically optimized treatment plans were the individual tissue radiosensitivities are not precisely considered",

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate the incidence and influencing factors of acute genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal morbidities in patients with prostate cancer treated with proton therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 287 patients with histologically proven Stage cT1-T4N0M0 prostate cancer were treated with proton therapy between 2003 and 2004. Of these, 204 (71\%) received neoadjuvant androgen suppression therapy. The patients were treated with 190-230-MeV protons using lateral-opposed techniques to a dose of 74 GyE. Dose-volume histogram analyses were performed. The incidence of acute morbidity was evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0. Clinical factors, including age, clinical target volume, initial prostate-specific antigen level, T stage, presence of diabetes mellitus, and the use of androgen suppression therapy, were investigated to determine whether those affected the incidence of acute GU morbidity. RESULTS: None developed Grade 2 or higher acute gastrointestinal morbidity. In contrast, 111 (39\%) and 4 (1\%) patients experienced acute Grade 2 and Grade 3 GU morbidities, respectively. However, 87\% of the patients were successfully relieved by the administration of a selective alpha-1 blocker. Multivariate analysis showed that a larger clinical target volume (p = 0.001) and the use of androgen suppression therapy (p = 0.017) were significant factors for the prediction of acute Grade 2-3 GU morbidity. CONCLUSION: In our experience with proton therapy, a low incidence of acute gastrointestinal morbidity was observed. In contrast, the incidence of acute GU morbidity was similar to that in other reports of photon radiotherapy. Additional follow-up is warranted to elucidate the long-term safety and efficacy of proton therapy for prostate cancer",

abstract="A new approach to the problem of modelling and predicting respiration motion has been implemented. This is a dual-component model, which describes the respiration motion as a non-periodic time series superimposed onto a periodic waveform. A periodic autoregressive moving average algorithm has been used to define a mathematical model of the periodic and non-periodic components of the respiration motion. The periodic components of the motion were found by projecting multiple inhale-exhale cycles onto a common subspace. The component of the respiration signal that is left after removing this periodicity is a partially autocorrelated time series and was modelled as an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) process. The accuracy of the periodic ARMA model with respect to fluctuation in amplitude and variation in length of cycles has been assessed. A respiration phantom was developed to simulate the inter-cycle variations seen in free-breathing and coached respiration patterns. At +/-14\% variability in cycle length and maximum amplitude of motion, the prediction errors were 4.8\% of the total motion extent for a 0.5 s ahead prediction, and 9.4\% at 1.0 s lag. The prediction errors increased to 11.6\% at 0.5 s and 21.6\% at 1.0 s when the respiration pattern had +/-34\% variations in both these parameters. Our results have shown that the accuracy of the periodic ARMA model is more strongly dependent on the variations in cycle length than the amplitude of the respiration cycles",

abstract="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Localisation images normally acquired to verify patient positioning also contain information about the patient's internal anatomy. The aim of this study was to investigate the anatomical changes observed in localisation images and examples of dosimetric consequences. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Localisation images were obtained weekly prior to radiotherapy with an electronic portal imaging device (EPID). A series of 'difference images' was created by subtracting the first localisation image from that of subsequent fractions. Images from 81 lung, 40 head and neck and 34 prostate cancer patients were classified according to the changes observed. Changes were considered relevant if the average pixel value over an area of at least 1cm(2) differed by more than 5\%, to allow for variations in linac output and EPID signal. Two patients were selected to illustrate the dosimetric effects of relevant changes. Their plans were re-calculated with repeat CT scans acquired after 4 weeks of treatment and compared with the difference images of the corresponding days. RESULTS: Progressive changes were detected for 57\% of lung and 37\% of head and neck cancer patients studied. Random changes were observed in 37\% of lung, 28\% of head and neck and 82\% of prostate cancer patients. For a lung case, an increase of 10.0\% in EPID dose due to tumour shrinkage corresponded to an increase of 9.8\% in mean lung dose. Gas pockets in the rectum region of the prostate case increased the EPID dose by 6.3\%, and resulted in a decrease of the minimum dose to the planning target volume of 26.4\%. CONCLUSIONS: Difference images are an efficient means of qualitatively detecting anatomical changes for various treatment sites in clinical practice. They can be used to identify changes for a particular patient, to indicate if the dose delivered to the patient would differ from planning and to detect if there is a need for re-planning",

Design: A retrospective study of patients identified from the institutional tumor registry between 1994 and 1999. Setting: The Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center, Indianapolis, IN. Patients: All patients with stage I and II NSCLC as identified above. Interventions: None. Measurements and results: Of 128 patients identified, 49 patients received no cancer treatment, 36 patients received radiation therapy only, and 43 patients were treated with primary surgery. Median \{+/-\} SD survival time following surgery was 46.2 \{+/-\} 3.15 months; for no treatment, 14.2 \{+/-\} 2.37 months (p = 3.2 x 10-6); and radiotherapy alone, 19.9 \{+/-\} 5.6 months (p = 0.0005). Of those who received no specific cancer treatment, 14 patients refused treatment and the remainder were not treated for a variety of medical reasons. Cause of death was cancer in 53\% of untreated patients and 43\% for those receiving radiotherapy. Radiotherapy was administered for postobstructive atelectasis, hemoptysis, increasing tumor size, pain, pleural effusion, and medical inoperability. Radiation dosages had no apparent standard. No significant differences in survival were found for patients receiving radiotherapy with either curative or palliative intent (20.3 months vs 16.0 months, respectively; p = 0.229). Conclusions : Within the limitations of this retrospective study, it appears that untreated early stage lung cancer has a poor outcome, with > 50\% of patients dying of lung cancer. Surgery remains the treatment of choice, but lung cancer screening programs will result in increasing numbers of medically inoperable patients with no clear policies for their management",

Among model-based techniques, deformable models offer a unique and powerful approach to image analysis that combines geometry, physics and approximation theory. They have proven to be effective in segmenting, matching and tracking anatomic structures by exploiting (bottom-up) constraints derived from the image data together with (top-down) a priori knowledge about the location, size and shape of these structures. Deformable models are capable of accommodating the significant variability of biological structures over time and across different individuals. Furthermore, they support highly intuitive interaction mechanisms that, when necessary, allow medical scientists and practitioners to bring their expertise to bear on the model-based image interpretation task. This article reviews the rapidly expanding body of work on the development and application of deformable models to problems of fundamental importance in medical image analysis, including segmentation, shape representation, matching and motion tracking",

abstract="An MLC control algorithm for delivering intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to targets that are undergoing two-dimensional (2D) rigid motion in the beam's eye view (BEV) is presented. The goal of this method is to deliver 3D-derived fluence maps over a moving patient anatomy. Target motion measured prior to delivery is first used to design a set of planned dynamic-MLC (DMLC) sliding-window leaf trajectories. During actual delivery, the algorithm relies on real-time feedback to compensate for target motion that does not agree with the motion measured during planning. The methodology is based on an existing one-dimensional (ID) algorithm that uses on-the-fly intensity calculations to appropriately adjust the DMLC leaf trajectories in real-time during exposure delivery [McMahon et al., Med. Phys. 34, 3211-3223 (2007)]. To extend the 1D algorithm's application to 2D target motion, a real-time leaf-pair shifting mechanism has been developed. Target motion that is orthogonal to leaf travel is tracked by appropriately shifting the positions of all MLC leaves. The performance of the tracking algorithm was tested for a single beam of a fractionated IMRT treatment, using a clinically derived intensity profile and a 2D target trajectory based on measured patient data. Comparisons were made between 2D tracking, 1D tracking, and no tracking. The impact of the tracking lag time and the frequency of real-time imaging were investigated. A study of the dependence of the algorithm's performance on the level of agreement between the motion measured during planning and delivery was also included. Results demonstrated that tracking both components of the 2D motion (i.e., parallel and orthogonal to leaf travel) results in delivered fluence profiles that are superior to those that track the component of motion that is parallel to leaf travel alone. Tracking lag time effects may lead to relatively large intensity delivery errors compared to the other sources of error investigated. However, the algorithm presented is robust in the sense that it does not rely on a high level of agreement between the target motion measured during treatment planning and delivery",

The BAT couch shift measurements were compared with the CT localization. Six of the patients had gold markers present in the prostate, and the prostate movement determined by BAT was compared with the movement determined by the gold markers. RESULTS: Using the BAT system, the 3 observers determined the prostate position to be a mean of 1-5 mm over all directions with respect to the CT. The proportion of readings with a difference >3 mm between the observers was in the range of 25\% to 44\%. The prostate movement based on gold markers was an average of 3-5 mm different from that measured by BAT. The literature assessing the accuracy and reproducibility on BAT is summarized and compared with our findings. CONCLUSIONS: We have found that there are systematic differences between the BAT-defined prostate position compared with that estimated on CT using gold grain marker seeds",

abstract="A new modification of the dynamic multileaf collimator (dMLC) delivery technique for intensity-modulated therapy (IMRT) is outlined. This technique enables the tracking of a target moving through rigid-body translations in a 2D trajectory in the beam's eye view. The accuracy of the delivery versus that of deliveries with no tracking and of 1D tracking techniques is quantified with clinically derived intensity-modulated beams (IMBs). Leaf trajectories calculated in the target-reference frame were iteratively synchronized assuming regular target motion. This allowed the leaves defined in the lab-reference frame to simultaneously follow the target motion and to deliver the required IMB without violation of the leaf maximum-velocity constraint. The leaves are synchronized until the gradient of the leaf position at every instant is less than a calculated maximum. The delivered fluence in the target-reference frame was calculated with a simple primary-fluence model. The new 2D tracking technique was compared with the delivered fluence produced by no-tracking deliveries and by 1D tracking deliveries for 33 clinical IMBs. For the clinical IMBs normalized to a maximum fluence of 200 MUs, the rms difference between the desired and the delivered IMB was 15.6 +/- 3.3 MU for the case of a no-tracking delivery, 7.9 +/- 1.6 MU for the case where only the primary component of motion was corrected and 5.1 +/- 1.1 MU for the 2D tracking delivery. The residual error is due to interpolation and sampling effects. The 2D tracking delivery technique requires an increase in the delivery time evaluated as between 0 and 50\% of the unsynchronized delivery time for each beam with a mean increase of 13\% for the IMBs tested. The 2D tracking dMLC delivery technique allows an optimized IMB to be delivered to moving targets with increased accuracy and with acceptable increases in delivery time. When combined with real-time knowledge of the target motion at delivery time, this technique facilitates improved target conformality relative to no-tracking deliveries and allows PTV margin reduction",

abstract="Respiratory motion-induced degradation of intensity-modulated radiotherapy can be corrected by the dynamic target-tracking motion of multileaf collimator equipment on a conventional linear accelerator. This paper presents a new system by which the motion of the tissue and the delivery equipment can be incorporated into the treatment optimization using a 4D direct-aperture optimization method. The program can optimize a static or dynamic delivery with respect to a 4D patient model. The individualized patient model consists of a series of discrete phases and describes changes in tissue: deformation, geometry, attenuation and scatter properties over the breathing cycle. A set of treatment apertures is matched to the respiratory phases of the motion model, and motion of the apertures between phases is constrained by the maximum leaf velocity. Plans with dynamic and static deliveries optimized on 4D patient models were compared to static plans optimized on a single phase. This investigation was carried out on a 4D digital motion phantom and repeated on a 4D patient model. The effect of motion of the static plan on the 4D phantom was evaluated by recalculating dose from all phases of the 4D model. The plan cost was evaluated as a combination of the rms spread in tumour dose from the prescribed dose and the volume of normal lung receiving doses above 10 Gy with relative weightings of 5 and 1 respectively. The motion was found to degrade the static plan by 30 +/- 4\% with respect to the 3D cost function value. In contrast, the motion did not cause significant degradation to a treatment if the treatment was optimized on the 4D phantom and the cost was improved by 16 +/- 3\% by optimizing with dynamic leaf tracking motion. All results are relative to the static single-phase plan. In the 4D patient model the observed tissue motion was considerably less and the measured benefit of 4D planning was consequently reduced. For the 4D patient the plan cost was not significantly changed by the tissue motion. Optimizing on 4D patient conferred an improvement of 7.5 +/- 0.3\%, and the 4D plan with dynamic leaf motion improved the plan cost by 8.3 +/- 0.1\%",

abstract="Tumor trailing techniques have been proposed as a method of reducing the problem of intrafraction motion in radiotherapy. However the dosimetric assessment of trailing strategies is complicated by the requirement to study dose deposition over a full fraction delivery. Common 4D planning strategies allowing assessment of dosimetric motion effects study a single cycle acquired with 4DCT. In this paper, a methodology to assess dose deposited over an entire treatment course is advanced and used to assess the potential benefit of tumor trailing strategies for lung cancer patients. Two digital phantoms mimicking patient anatomy were each programmed to follow the tumor respiratory trajectory observed from 33 lung cancer patients. The two phantoms were designed to represent the cases of a small (volume = 13.6 cm(3)) and large (volume = 181.7 cm(3)) lung lesion. Motion margins required to obtain CTV coverage by 95\% of the prescription dose to 90\% of the available cases were computed for a standard treatment strategy and a trailing treatment strategy. The trailing strategy facilitated a margin reduction of over 30\% relative to the conventional delivery. When the dose was computed across the entire delivery for the 33 cases, the trailing strategy was found to significantly reduce the underdosage to the outlier cases and the reduced trailing margin facilitated a 15\% (small lesion) and 4\% (large lesion) reduction for the mean lung dose and 7\% (small lesion) and 10\% (large lesion) for the mean esophagus dose. Finally, for comparison an ideal continuous tracking strategy was assessed and found to further reduce the mean lung and esophagus dose. However, this improvement comes at the price of increased delivery complexity and increased reliance on tumor localization accuracy",

abstract="Purpose: To quantify in three dimensions the geometric uncertainties of bladder irradiation (i.e., uncertainties in target delineation, organ motion, and patient setup).Methods and Materials: Pelvic CT images were obtained for 10 male bladder cancer patients. Apart from the initial planning CT scan, three follow-up scans were made for each of the patients. The bladder volumes in the planning CT scan were outlined by seven radiation oncologists. One observer also delineated the bladder volumes in the follow-up scans. Two-dimensional scalar maps of the interobserver variation and organ motion of the bladder surfaces were constructed. The setup errors were derived from the portal imaging results of the pooled group of bladder and prostate patients.Results: All bladder volumes were consistently outlined by all observers. Generally small variations occurred (1.5-3 mm, 1 SD), although in 50\% of the patients, larger discrepancies were observed in discriminating the bladder from the base of the prostate. Analysis of the portal imaging data showed setup errors of up to 3 mm (1 SD). Organ motion is the predominant geometric uncertainty in the radiotherapy process (5 mm, 1 SD, at the cranial side of the bladder), although 9 of 10 patients were able to preserve a fairly reproducible bladder volume during the complete treatment course.Conclusion: Anisotropic margins between the clinical target volume and planning target volume are needed in conformal radiotherapy of the bladder. Especially at the cranial side of the bladder, larger margins are needed because of the impact of bladder shape variation",

abstract="AIM: of this study was to validate a newly developed high energy probe (positron emission probe, PEP) optimised for localising PET tracers in vivo. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Physical investigations included determination of full width at half maximum (FWHM) values at a distance of 1 cm and angular resolution using different point sources. Values obtained with the new probe were compared to those of a conventional gamma probe (CGP). Additionally, PET studies were performed in 36 patients (6 women, 30 men) with proven head and neck cancer and suspected lymph node metastases (Axis, Marconi/Philips) after administering 250-320 MBq (18)F-FDG. Subsequent to PET investigations (18)F-FDG uptake in cervical regions was measured using the PEP. PEP investigations were carried out bilaterally in 5 lymph node (LN) levels (Robbins' classification of the neck). Results of probe studies were correlated with visual and semiquantitative PET evaluations, US and histological findings. RESULTS: FWHM of the new probe was 7 mm (CGP 22 mm) at 662 keV ((137)Cs) and angular resolution resulted in 8 degrees (CGP 60 degrees ). In 29 out of 36 patients LN metastases were suspected due to ultrasound investigations. After neck dissection, histology confirmed LN metastases in 21 patients. Sensitivity (sens.) of US amounted to 95\% and specificity to 40\%. In 18/21 patients LN metastases were detected by PET (sens. 86\%). PET scans failed to diagnose the LN status correctly in 6/36 patients (accuracy 83\%). Employing the PEP probe in 20/21 patients LN metastases were identified (sens. 95\%), and LN status was determined accurately in 29/36 patients (accuracy 81\%). Tumour/background ratios of PEP measurement and results of semiquantitative PET analyses were comparable. CONCLUSIONS: PEP measurement is a promising method for preoperative planning of the extent of neck dissection in patients with head and neck cancer and further for radioguided localising PET tracer accumulation during surgery",

abstract="Online adaptive radiation therapy (ART) has great promise to significantly reduce normal tissue toxicity and/or improve tumor control through real-time treatment adaptations based on the current patient anatomy. However, the major technical obstacle for clinical realization of online ART, namely the inability to achieve real-time efficiency in treatment re-planning, has yet to be solved. To overcome this challenge, this paper presents our work on the implementation of an intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) direct aperture optimization (DAO) algorithm on the graphics processing unit (GPU) based on our previous work on the CPU. We formulate the DAO problem as a large-scale convex programming problem, and use an exact method called the column generation approach to deal with its extremely large dimensionality on the GPU. Five 9-field prostate and five 5-field head-and-neck IMRT clinical cases with 5 x 5 mm(2) beamlet size and 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 mm(3) voxel size were tested to evaluate our algorithm on the GPU. It takes only 0.7-3.8 s for our implementation to generate high-quality treatment plans on an NVIDIA Tesla C1060 GPU card. Our work has therefore solved a major problem in developing ultra-fast (re-)planning technologies for online ART",

Males (73.4\%) were more commonly affected (P?<?0.001). Heart rate (mean???SD) on presentation was different amongst the 3 groups of dogs (P?<?0.001) (Group NoDz: 120???8.0?bpm, Group DzNoF: 155???7.6?bpm, and Group DzF: 203???6.2?bpm). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a longer survival for dogs in Group NoDz (P?=?0.006) and large and giant breeds (P?=?0.02). Initial heart rate could not be separated from diseased group as an independent determinant of survival.Conclusions Results suggest that dogs with AF and no demonstrable cardiac disease have a slower presenting heart rate and greater survival than dogs with structural disease with and without heart failure",

Pretreatment genitourinary (GU) symptom management was required in 38\% of patients. A cumulative 88 (42\%) patients required posttreatment GU symptom management. Four transient Grade 3 GU toxicities occurred, all among patients requiring pretreatment GU symptom management. Multivariate analysis showed correlation between posttreatment GU 2+ symptoms and pretreatment GU symptom management (p < 0.0001) and age (p?= 0.0048). Only 1 Grade 3+ gastrointestinal (GI) symptom occurred. The prevalence of Grade 2+ GI symptoms was 0 (0\%), 10 (5\%), 12 (6\%), and 8 (4\%) at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, with a cumulative incidence of 20 (10\%) patients at 2 years after proton therapy. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed significant correlation between Grade 2+ rectal bleeding and proctitis and the percentage of rectal wall (rectum) receiving doses ranging from 40 CGE (10 CGE) to 80 CGE.Conclusions Early outcomes with image-guided proton therapy suggest high efficacy and minimal toxicity with only 1.9\% Grade 3 GU symptoms and <0.5\% Grade 3 GI toxicities",

abstract="Scattered neutron dose equivalent to a representative point for a fetus is evaluated in an anthropomorphic phantom of the mother undergoing proton radiotherapy. The effect on scattered neutron dose equivalent to the fetus of changing the incident proton beam energy, aperture size, beam location, and air gap between the beam delivery snout and skin was studied for both a small field snout and a large field snout. Measurements of the fetus scattered neutron dose equivalent were made by placing a neutron bubble detector 10 cm below the umbilicus of an anthropomorphic Rando phantom enhanced by a wax bolus to simulate a second trimester pregnancy. The neutron dose equivalent in milliSieverts (mSv) per proton treatment Gray increased with incident proton energy and decreased with aperture size, distance of the fetus representative point from the field edge, and increasing air gap. Neutron dose equivalent to the fetus varied from 0.025 to 0.450 mSv per proton Gray for the small field snout and from 0.097 to 0.871 mSv per proton Gray for the large field snout. There is likely to be no excess risk to the fetus of severe mental retardation for a typical proton treatment of 80 Gray to the mother since the scattered neutron dose to the fetus of 69.7 mSv is well below the lower confidence limit for the threshold of 300 mGy observed for the occurrence of severe mental retardation in prenatally exposed Japanese atomic bomb survivors. However, based on the linear no threshold hypothesis, and this same typical treatment for the mother, the excess risk to the fetus of radiation induced cancer death in the first 10 years of life is 17.4 per 10,000 children",

abstract="This paper is the first investigation of using direct aperture optimization (DAO) for online adaptive radiation therapy (ART). A geometrical model representing the anatomy of a typical prostate case was created. To simulate interfractional deformations, four different anatomical deformations were created by systematically deforming the original anatomy by various amounts (0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00 cm). We describe a series of techniques where the original treatment plan was adapted in order to correct for the deterioration of dose distribution quality caused by the anatomical deformations. We found that the average time needed to adapt the original plan to arrive at a clinically acceptable plan is roughly half of the time needed for a complete plan regeneration, for all four anatomical deformations. Furthermore, through modification of the DAO algorithm the optimization search space was reduced and the plan adaptation was significantly accelerated. For the first anatomical deformation (0.25 cm), the plan adaptation was six times more efficient than the complete plan regeneration. For the 0.50 and 0.75 cm deformations, the optimization efficiency was increased by a factor of roughly 3 compared to the complete plan regeneration. However, for the anatomical deformation of 1.00 cm, the reduction of the optimization search space during plan adaptation did not result in any efficiency improvement over the original (nonmodified) plan adaptation. The anatomical deformation of 1.00 cm demonstrates the limit of this approach. We propose an innovative approach to online ART in which the plan adaptation and radiation delivery are merged together and performed concurrently-adaptive radiation delivery (ARD). A fundamental advantage of ARD is the fact that radiation delivery can start almost immediately after image acquisition and evaluation. Most of the original plan adaptation is done during the radiation delivery, so the time spent adapting the original plan does not increase the overall time the patient has to spend on the treatment couch. As a consequence, the effective time allotted for plan adaptation is drastically reduced. For the 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 cm anatomical deformations, the treatment time was increased by only 2, 4, and 6 s, respectively, as compared to no plan adaptation. For the anatomical deformation of 1.0 cm the time increase was substantially larger. The anatomical deformation of 1.0 cm represents an extreme case, which is rarely observed for the prostate, and again demonstrates the limit of this approach. ARD shows great potential for an online adaptive method with minimal extension of treatment time",

Simulation studies were carried out with various image series containing a rigid object of interest that was moved along a predefined trajectory. For each of the series the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was varied to compare the performance of the algorithms under noisy conditions. For a poor SNR of -6 dB the mean tracking error was 2.4, 6.5, 39.0, and 17.2 pixels for MSSD, CC, CR and MI, respectively, with a standard deviation of 1.9, 12.9, 19.5, and 7.5 pixels, respectively. The size of a pixel was 0.5 mm. These results improved to 1.1, 1.3, 1.3, and 2.0 pixels, respectively, with a standard deviation of 0.6, 0.8, 0.8, and 2.1 pixels, respectively, when a mean filter was applied to the images prior to tracking. The implementation of MSSD into existing in-house software demonstrated that, depending on the search range, it was possible to process between 2 and 15 images/s, making this approach capable of real-time applications. In conclusion, the best geometric tracking accuracy overall was obtained with MSSD, followed by CC, CR, and MI. The simplest and best algorithm, both in terms of geometric accuracy as well as computational cost, was the MSSD algorithm and was therefore the method of choice",

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate the interfractional reproducibility of respiration-induced lung tumors motion, defined by their centroids and the intrafractional target motion range. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twentythree pairs of four-dimensional/computed tomography scans were acquired for 22 patients. Gross tumor volumes were contoured, Clinical target volumes (CTVs) were generated. Geometric data for CTVs and lung volumes were extracted. The motion tracks of CTV centroids, and CTV edges along the cranio-caudal, anterior-posterior, and lateral directions were evaluated. The Pearson correlation coefficient for motion tracks along the cranio-caudal direction was determined for the entire respiratory cycle and for five phases about the end of expiration. RESULTS: The largest motion extent was along the cranio-caudal direction. The intrafractional motion extent for five CTVs was <0.5 cm, the largest motion range was 3.59 cm. Three CTVs with respiration-induced displacement >0.5 cm did not exhibit the similarity of motion, and for 16 CTVs with motion >0.5 cm the correlation coefficient was >0.8. The lung volumes in corresponding phases for cases that demonstrated CTVs motion similarity were reproducible. No correlation between tumor size and mobility was found. CONCLUSION: Target motion reproducibility seems to be present in 87\% of cases in our dataset. Three cases with dissimilar motion indicate that it is advisable to verify target motion during treatment. The adaptive adjustment to compensate the possible interfractional shifts in a target position should be incorporated as a routine policy for lung cancer radiotherapy",

abstract="PURPOSE: To quantify pancreas tumor motion on both a planning 4D-CT and during a single fraction treatment using the CyberKnife linear accelerator and Synchrony respiratory tracking software, and to investigate whether a single 4D-CT study is reliable for determining radiation treatment margins for patients with locally advanced pancreas cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty patients underwent fiducial placement, biphasic pancreatic protocol CT scan and 4D-CT scan in the treatment position while free-breathing. Patients were then treated with a single 25 Gy fraction of stereotactic body radiotherapy. Predicted pancreas motion in the superior-inferior (SI), left-right (LR), and anterior-posterior (AP) directions was calculated from the maximum inspiration and maximum expiration 4D-CT scan. For CyberKnife treatments, mean respiratory cycle motion and maximum respiratory cycle motion was determined in the SI, LR, and AP directions. RESULTS: The range of centroid movement based on 4D-CT in the SI, LR, and AP directions were 0.9 to 28.8 mm, 0.1 to 13.7 mm, and 0.2 to 7.6 mm, respectively. During CyberKnife treatment, in the SI direction, the mean motion of the centroid ranged from 0.5 to 12.7 mm. In the LR direction, the mean motion range was 0.4 to 9.4 mm. In the AP direction, the mean motion range was 0.6 to 5.5 mm. The maximum range of movement (mean) during CyberKnife treatment in the SI, LR, and AP directions were 4.5 to 48.8 mm (mean 20.8 mm), 1.5 to 41.3 mm (mean 11.3 mm), and 1.6 to 68.1 mm (mean 13.4 mm), respectively. Neither the maximum or mean motion correlated with the 4D-CT movement. CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial respiratory associated motion of pancreatic tumors. The 4D-CT planning scans cannot accurately predict the movement of pancreatic tumors during actual treatment on CyberKnife",

abstract="Abstract: Purpose: In order to reduce the treatment margin of the moving target due to breathing, we developed a gated irradiation system for heavy-ion radiotherapy.Methods and Materials: The motion of a patient due to respiration is detected by the motion of the body surface around the chest wall. A respiratory sensor was developed using an infrared light spot and a position-sensitive detector. A timing signal to request a beam is generated in response to the respiration waveform, and a carbon beam is extracted from the synchrotron using a RF-knockout method. CT images for treatment planning are taken in synchronization with the respiratory motion. For patient positioning, digitized fluoroscopic images superimposed with the respiration waveform were used. The relation between the respiratory sensor signal and the organ motion was examined using digitized video images from fluoroscopy. The performance of our gated system was demonstrated by using the moving phantom, and dose profiles were measured in the direction of phantom motion.Results: The timing of gate-on is set at the end of the expiratory phase, because the motion of the diaphragm is slower and more reproducible than during the inspiratory phase. The signal of the respiratory sensor shows a phase difference of 120 milliseconds between lower and upper locations on the chest wall. The motion of diaphragm is delayed by 200 milliseconds from the respiration waveform at the lower location. The beam extraction system worked according to the beam on/off logic for gating, and the gated CT scanner performed well. The lateral penumbra size of the dose profile along the moving axis was distinguishably decreased by the gated irradiation. The ratio of the nongated to gated lateral fall-off was 4.3, 3.5, and 2.0 under the stroke of 40.0, 29.0, and 13.0 mm respectively.Conclusion: We developed a total treatment system of gated irradiation for heavy-ion radiotherapy. We found that with this system the target margin along the body axis could be decreased to 5-10 mm although the target moved twice or three times. Over 150 patients with lung or liver cancer had already been treated by this gated irradiation system by the end of July 1999",

abstract="PurposeTo propose a method for estimating uncertainties of the range calculation in particle radiotherapy associated with patient respiration.Methods and materialsA set of sequential CT images at every 0.2 s was reconstructed from continuous X-ray projection data accumulated by dynamic helical scanning. At the same time that CT data was acquired, the respiratory signal of the patient and the X-ray on/off signal on CT scanner were recorded. Each CT image was timed according to the phase of respiration waveform. Conversion of the CT number to the water equivalent path length (WEL) was performed with our treatment planning system that included a conversion table. As an illustration, the CT images of a patient with liver cancer at the right upper lobe were analyzed. The geometric size of the liver and WELs from body surface to isocenter were measured in each CT image.Results: Variations of WEL from body surface to isocenter at the anterior-posterior and posterior-anterior direction were 6.2 mm and 18.9 mm, respectively. Liver size changed by 35.2 mm. However, these variations were shown to be considerably reduced by gated irradiation.Conclusion: A method using sequential CT images with respiration waveform was proposed. It appeared to be useful in evaluating the uncertainties of the range calculation associated with patient breathing",

abstract="In the last few years, hospital-based facilities for carbon-ion radiotherapy are being constructed and proposed in Europe and Asia. During the next few years, several new facilities will be opened for carbon-ion radiotherapy in the world. These facilities in operation or under construction are categorized in two types by the beam shaping method used. One is the passive beam shaping method that is mainly improved and systematized for routine clinical use at HIMAC, Japan. The other method is active beam shaping which is also known as beam scanning adopted at GSI/HIT, Germany. In this paper an overview of some technical aspects for beam shaping is reported. The technique of passive beam shaping is established for stable clinical application and has clinical result of over 4000 patients in HIMAC. In contrast, clinical experience of active beam shaping is about 400 patients, and there is no clinical experience to respiratory moving target. A great advantage of the active beam shaping method is patient-specific collimator-less and compensator-less treatment. This may be an interesting potential for adaptive radiotherapy",

abstract="Isolated adult cardiac myocytes maintained in primary culture have been used as a model of the adult myocardium for 20 years. With the recent advances and current interest in using molecular biological techniques to investigate cardiac physiology, culturing myocytes is becoming an increasingly important technique. Acutely isolated myocytes do not remain viable for the time needed for the changes in gene expression to occur, and therefore it is necessary to maintain myocytes in culture. The aims of this review are: (1) To describe a method for isolating and culturing myocytes in serum-free medium. This section is targeted at new researchers in the field, with particular emphasis on aspects of the isolation procedure which are important for optimising myocyte culture. (2) To review current knowledge of how contractile, electrophysiological and morphological properties of adult myocytes are preserved in culture. Over the past 5 to 10 years significant advances have been made in developing novel techniques which help maintain the in-vivo properties of myocytes in culture. Efficient methods for transporting exogenous genes and anti-sense oligonucleotides into adult myocytes are now available. We anticipate that in future these advances will make cultured myocytes more attractive for use in biophysical and molecular investigations of cardiac physiology",

abstract="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Heavy ion radiotherapy is a promising modality because of its excellent dose localization and high biological effect on tumors. Using carbon beams, a dose escalation study was conducted for the treatment of stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to determine the optimal dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The first stage phase I/II trial using 18 fractions over 6 weeks for 47 patients and the second one using nine fractions over 3 weeks for 34 patients were conducted by the dose escalation method from 59.4 to 95.4 Gray equivalents (GyE) in incremental steps of 10\% and from 68.4 to 79.2 GyE in 5\% increments, respectively. The local control and survival rates were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Radiation pneumonitis at grade III occurred in three of 81 patients, but they fully recovered. This was not a dose-limiting factor. The local control rates in the first and second trials were 64\% and 84\%, respectively. The total recurrence rate in both trials was 23.2\%. The infield local recurrence in the first trial was significantly dependent on carbon dose. The doses greater than 86.4 GyE at 18 fractions and 72 GyE at nine fractions achieved a local control of 90\% and 95\%, respectively. The 5 year overall and cause-specific survivals in 81 patients were 42\% and 60\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: With our dose escalation study, the optimum safety and efficacy dose of carbon beams was determined. Carbon beam therapy attained almost the same results as surgery for stage I NSCLC although this was a I/II study",

Second, a Phase II study using the optimal dose was performed. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the local control and 5-year survival rates. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between April 1999 and December 2000, 50 patients with 51 primary lesions were treated. Using a fixed dose of 72 GyE in nine fractions over 3 weeks, the primary tumors were irradiated with carbon ion beams alone. The average age of the patients was 74.5 years. Thirty-three (66\%) of these were medically inoperable.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the local control and 5-year survival rates. METHODS: From December 2000 to November 2003, 79 patients with 80 primary lesions were treated. Using a fixed dose of 52.8 GyE for stage IA NSCLC and 60.0 GyE for stage IB NSCLC in four fractions during 1 week, the primary tumors were irradiated with carbon beams alone. The average age of the patients was 74.8 years. Sixty-two (78.5\%) of these patients were medically inoperable. Local control and survival were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. The data were statistically processed using the log-rank test. RESULTS: All patients were observed for a minimum of 3 years or until death, with a median follow-up time of 38.6 months, ranging from 2.5 to 72.2 months. The local control rate for all patients was 90\% (T1: 98\%, T2: 80\%). The patients' 5-year lung cancer-specific survival rate was 68\% (IA: 87\%, IB: 42\%). The overall survival was 45\% (IA: 62\%, IB: 25\%). Half of the deaths were attributable to intercurrent diseases. No toxic reactions in the lung greater than grade 3 were detected. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion beam radiotherapy with a regimen of four fractions during 1 week has been proven as a valid alternative to surgery for stage I NSCLC and to offer particular benefits, especially for elderly and inoperable patients",

abstract="PURPOSE: Recent imaging studies have demonstrated that there can be significant changes in anatomy from day to day and over the course of radiotherapy as a result of daily positioning uncertainties and physiologic and clinical factors. There are a number of strategies to minimize such changes, reduce their impact, or correct for them. Measures to date have included improved immobilization of external and internal anatomy or adjustment of positions based on portal or ultrasound images. Perhaps the most accurate way is to use CT image-guided radiotherapy, for which the possibilities range from simple correction of setup based on daily CT images to on-line near real-time intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) replanning. In addition, there are numerous intermediate possibilities. In this paper, we report the development of one such intermediate method that takes into account anatomic changes by deforming the intensity distributions of each beam based on deformations of anatomy as seen in the beam's-eye-view. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The intensity distribution deformations are computed based on anatomy deformations discerned from the changes in the current image relative to a reference image (e.g., the pretreatment CT scan). First, a reference IMRT plan is generated based on the reference CT image. A new CT image is acquired using an in-room CT for every fraction. The anatomic structure contours are obtained for the new image. (For this article, these contours were manually drawn. When image guided IMRT methods are implemented, anatomic structure contours on subsequent images will likely be obtained with automatic or semiautomatic means. This could be achieved by, for example, first deforming the original CT image to match today's image, and then using the same deformation transformation to map original contours to today's image.) The reference intensity distributions for each beam are then deformed so that the projected geometric relationship within the beam's-eye-view between the anatomy (both target and normal tissues) extracted from the reference image and the reference intensity distribution is the same as (or as close as possible to) the corresponding relationship between anatomy derived from today's image and the newly deformed intensity distributions. To verify whether the dose distributions calculated using the deformed intensity distributions are acceptable for treatment as compared to the original intensity distributions, the deformed intensities are transformed into leaf sequences, which are then used to compute intensity and dose distributions expected to be delivered. The corresponding dose-volume histograms and dose-volume and dose-response indices are also computed. These data are compared with the corresponding data derived (a) from the original treatment plan applied to the original image, (b) from the original treatment plan applied to today's image, and (c) from a new full-fledged IMRT plan designed based on today's image. RESULTS: Depending on the degree of anatomic changes, the use of an IMRT plan designed based on the original planning CT for the treatment of the current fraction could lead to significant differences compared to the intended dose distributions. CT-guided setup compared to the setup based on skin marks or bony landmarks may improve dose distributions somewhat. Replanning IMRT based on the current fraction's image yields the best physically deliverable plan (the ``gold standard''). For the prostate and head-and-neck examples studied as proof of principle, the results of deforming intensities within each beam based on the anatomy seen in the beam's-eye-view are a good approximation of full-fledged replanning compared with other alternatives. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results encourage us to believe that deforming intensities taking into account deformation in the anatomy may be a rapid way to produce new treatment plans on-line in near real-time based on daily CT images. The methods we have developed need to be applied to a group of patients for both prostate and head-and-neck cases to confirm the validity of our approach",

abstract="Segmentation of time series of 3D cardiac images is clinically used for the assessment of the mechanical function of the left ventricle. To take into account the 4D (3D+T) nature of those images, we propose to extend the deformable surface framework by introducing time-dependent constraints. Thus, in addition to computing an internal force for enforcing the regularity of the deformable model, prior motion knowledge is introduced in the deformation process through either temporal smoothing or trajectory constraints. In this paper, deformable surfaces are represented as simplex meshes owing to their generality and their ability to compute mean curvature at each vertex. The segmentation accuracy of this 4D deformable model is estimated on synthetic SPECT image sequences for which a ground truth about the LV volume is known. Segmentation of non-synthetic SPECT and other modalities 4D images is also discussed",

abstract="PURPOSE: The CT body surface underpins millimeter scale dose computation in radical radiotherapy. A lack of technology has prevented measurement of surface topology changes during irradiation. Consequently, body changes are incorporated into plans statistically. We describe the technology for dynamic measurement of continuous surface topology at submillimeter resolution and suggest appropriately modified planning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An interferometer casts cosinusoidal fringes across the surface of a patient on a treatment couch. Motion-induced changes to the spatial phase of the fringes are used to generate dynamic sequences of body height maps. Volume-conserving CT warping, guided by height change, is used to illustrate potential planning perturbations. RESULTS: We present the results for a prone patient with rectal carcinoma. At most of the simultaneously measured 440 x 440 points in each of the 898 body height maps in a dynamic sequence, the standard deviations were <1-2 mm, with occasional points of 6 mm. Surface motion predominantly occurred along the small of the back. This motion was periodic and could take the spine and bladder across the 95\% isodose contour. CONCLUSIONS: Surface changes are most likely to be within 3 mm during irradiation, despite the effects of breathing and the discomfort of lying prone. The dosimetric effects are acceptable",

abstract="Treatment plans for intensity-modulated proton therapy may be sensitive to some sources of uncertainty. One source is correlated with approximations of the algorithms applied in the treatment planning system and another one depends on how robust the optimization is with regard to intra-fractional tissue movements. The irradiated dose distribution may substantially deteriorate from the planning when systematic errors occur in the dose algorithm. This can influence proton ranges and lead to improper modeling of the Braggpeak degradation in heterogeneous structures or particle scatter or the nuclear interaction part. Additionally, systematic errors influence the optimization process, which leads to the convergence error. Uncertainties with regard to organ movements are related to the robustness of a chosen beam setup to tissue movements on irradiation. We present the inverse Monte Carlo treatment planning system IKO for protons (IKO-P), which tries to minimize the errors described above to a large extent. Additionally, robust planning is introduced by beam angle optimization according to an objective function penalizing paths representing strongly longitudinal and transversal tissue heterogeneities. The same score function is applied to optimize spot planning by the selection of a robust choice of spots. As spots can be positioned on different energy grids or on geometric grids with different space filling factors, a variety of grids were used to investigate the influence on the spot-weight distribution as a result of optimization. A tighter distribution of spot weights was assumed to result in a more robust plan with respect to movements. IKO-P is described in detail and demonstrated on a test case and a lung cancer case as well. Different options of spot planning and grid types are evaluated, yielding a superior plan quality with dose delivery to the spots from all beam directions over optimized beam directions. This option shows a tighter spot-weight distribution and should therefore be less sensitive to movements compared to optimized directions. But accepting a slight loss in plan quality, the latter choice could potentially improve robustness even further by accepting only spots from the most proper direction. The choice of a geometric grid instead of an energy grid for spot positioning has only a minor influence on the plan quality, at least for the investigated lung case",

abstract="Respiratory-gated CT (RGCT) and four-dimensional CT (4DCT) scan techniques cover consecutive segments of the respiratory cycle. However, motion artefacts may occur in fast respiratory phases such as mid-inhalation and -exhalation. CT imaging involves the use of a number of x-ray tube positions for each couch position. We investigated the fundamental nature of motion artefacts using a constant-velocity moving phantom in motion in the CT plane or perpendicular to the CT plane, and in pigs to simulate a human model. Artefacts and movement distance were evaluated in a moving phantom and artificially ventilated pigs with a 256-multi-detector row CT (256MDCT). The phantom moved in the CT plane or perpendicular to the CT plane with a constant velocity. Backprojection used variable initial backprojection angles (IBAs). The phantom length for motion perpendicular to the CT plane was independent of IBA but was represented by phantom diameter plus the distance of movement per gantry rotation. In contrast, that for the motion in the CT plane was dependent on IBA, as represented by phantom diameter plus the distance of movement per rotation for IBA perpendicular to the phantom movement direction, and phantom diameter plus half the distance of movement per gantry rotation for other IBAs. Results for volumetric CT images with different IBAs showed the presence of banding artefacts. Similar findings were seen in artificially ventilated pigs. Motion artefacts are unavoidable in both conventional CT and 256MDCT. Banding artefacts will be improved if the same IBAs at each couch position are accounted for during image reconstruction. This improvement will be beneficial in respiratory gated and 4D radiation therapies",

abstract="PURPOSE: To analyze the water equivalent pathlength (WEL) fluctuations resulting from cardiac motion and display these variations on a beam's-eye-view image; the analysis provides insight into the accuracy of lung tumor irradiation with heavy charged particle beams. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Volumetric cine computed tomography (CT) images were obtained on 7 lung cancer patients under free-breathing conditions with a 256-multislice CT scanner. Cardiac phase was determined by selecting systole and diastole. A WEL difference image (DeltaWEL) was calculated by subtracting the WEL image at end-systole from that at end-diastole at respiratory exhalation phase. Two calculation regions were defined: Region 1 was limited to the volume defined by planes bounding the heart; Region 2 included the entire body thickness for a given beam's-eye-view angle. RESULTS: The DeltaWEL values observed in Region 1 showed fluctuations at the periphery of the heart that varied from 20.4 (SD, 5.2) mm WEL to -15.6 (3.2) mm WEL. The areas over which these range perturbation values were observed were 36.8 (32.4) mm(2) and 6.0 (2.8) mm(2) for positive and negative WEL, respectively. The WEL fluctuations in Region 2 increased by approximately 3-4 mm WEL, whereas negative WEL fluctuations changed by approximately -4 to -5 mm WEL, compared with WEL for Region 1; areas over 20 mm WEL changes in Region 2 increased by 9 mm(2) for positive DeltaWEL and 2 mm(2) for negative DeltaWEL. CONCLUSIONS: Cine CT with a 256-multislice CT scanner captures both volumetric cardiac and respiratory motion with a temporal resolution sufficient to estimate range fluctuations by these motions. This information can be used to assess the range perturbations that charged particle beams may experience in irradiation of lung or esophageal tumors adjacent to the heart",

We performed volumetric cine scanning using the 256-multi-slice CT (256MSCT) to study tumor motion during free breathing in 14 inpatients who were treated with carbon-ion radiotherapy. Motion assessment in 16 respiratory phases of the cine CT revealed most tumors to show hysteresis-like behavior. Isocenter displacement between peak exhalation and inhalation for the average of the right and left lungs were 7 mm, 7 mm and 15 mm for the upper, middle and lower lobes, respectively. Cine CT with the 256MSCT improved the evaluation of tumor displacement and overcomes some of the limitations associated with current CT methods.

abstract="PURPOSE: To assess the variation in carbon beam dose distribution due to residual motion in lung cancer patients undergoing respiratory-gated radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 11 lung cancer patients underwent four-dimensional computed tomography with a 256-multislice computed tomography scanner under free-breathing conditions. A compensating bolus was designed to cover the treatment beam for all planning target volumes during a 30\% duty cycle centered on exhalation (gating window). This bolus was applied to the four-dimensional computed tomography data for one respiratory cycle, and then the carbon beam dose distribution was calculated. RESULTS: A water equivalent pathlength variation of <5 mm was observed in the gating window, but this increased to </=20 mm on inhalation. As a result, beam overshoot/undershoot occurred around inhalation, which increased the excessive dosing to normal tissues and the organs at risk. The dose for >95\% volume irradiation is dependent on the respiratory phase but not the gating window. However, the dose for >95\% volume irradiation correlated well with the tumor displacement distance. More than 90\% of the dose for >95\% volume irradiation could be delivered in the gating window with <4-mm tumor displacement resulting from exhalation. CONCLUSION: The results of our study have shown that even when the treatment beam delivery occurs outside the gating window, the prescribed dose to the target is not affected in patients with a tumor displacement of <4 mm. Thus, respiratory gating is not required in radiotherapy for patients with <4-mm tumor displacement in a respiratory cycle",

abstract="PURPOSE: Range variations during respiration affect the penetration of charged particle beams and can result in beam overshoot or undershoot to the target. We have developed analysis tools to quantify the water equivalent pathlength (WEL) variations resulting from respiration (WEL analyzer, Aqualyzer), as well as a data explorer to view WEL variations interactively. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The metrics to characterize and quantify penetration of a charged particle beam during respiration were calculated semiautomatically. The analysis involved the generation of images that (1) encode the radiologic pathlength across a beam's eye view image during the respiratory phase, (2) display the variation of the radiologic pathlength relative to a reference respiratory phase, (3) display isopenetration as a function of breathing, and (4) show range fluctuation images for a compensating bolus when applied to four-dimensional computed tomography. Additional quantities relevant to the analysis of charged particle beams in a breathing patient that are calculated include the beam overshoot volume and beam overshoot distance. These quantities are calculated as a function of time, gantry angle, and position. RESULTS: The software was applied to test cases to illustrate its utility in the analysis of range variations of charged particle beams in the treatment of lung tumors. CONCLUSION: WEL analysis is useful in the rapid assessment of range variations in the treatment of lung tumors and in determining the optimal gantry angle and respiratory gating window. The extension of encoding range fluctuations to a beam's eye view display is helpful in designing plans that are more robust in the presence of motion",

Here, we emphasize the challenges of IGRT for charged particle beams. Radiological Physics and Technology (RTPE) readers interested in the common technologies of IGRT for photons and protons are referred to the plentiful articles already published. Our present deeper insight into IGRT arose through the collaboration of two particle therapy centers, the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS) in Japan and the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland.

abstract="Purpose: Irradiation of a moving target with a scanning beam requires a comprehensive understanding of organ motion as well as a robust dose error mitigation technique. The authors studied the effects of intrafractional respiratory motion for carbon-ion pencil beam scanning with phase-controlled rescanning on dose distributions for lung tumors. To address density variations, they used 4DCT data. Methods: Dose distributions for various rescanning methods, such as simple layer rescanning (LR), volumetric rescanning, and phase-controlled rescanning (PCR), were calculated for a lung phantom and a lung patient studies. To ensure realism, they set the scanning parameters such as scanning velocity and energy variation time to be similar to those used at our institution. Evaluation metrics were determined with regard to clinical relevance, and consisted of (i) phase-controlled rescanning, (ii) sweep direction, (iii) target motion (direction and amplitude), (iv) respiratory cycle, and (v) prescribed dose. Spot weight maps were calculated by using a beam field-specific target volume, which takes account of range variations for respective respiratory phases. To emphasize the impact of intrafractional motion on the dose distribution, respiratory gating was not used. The accumulated dose was calculated by applying a B-spline-based deformable image registration, and the results for phase-controlled layered rescanning (PCRL) and phase-controlled volumetric rescanning (PCRV) were compared. Results: For the phantom study, simple LR was unable to improve the dose distributions for an increased number of rescannings. The phase-controlled technique without rescanning (1?PCRL and 1?PCRV) degraded dose conformity significantly due to a reduced scan velocity. In contrast, 4?PCRL or more significantly and consistently improved dose distribution. PCRV showed interference effects, but in general also improved dose homogeneity with higher numbers of rescannings. Dose distributions with single PCRL/PCRV with a sweep direction perpendicular to motion direction showed large hot/cold spots; however, this effect vanished with higher numbers of rescannings for both methods. Similar observations were obtained for the other dose metrics, such as target motion (SI/AP), amplitude (6-22 mm peak-to-peak) and respiratory period (3.0-5.0 s). For four or more rescannings, both methods showed significantly better results, albeit that volumetric PCR was more affected by interference effects, which lead to severe degradation of a few dose distributions. The clinical example showed the same tendencies as the phantom study. Dose assessment metrics (D95, Dmax/Dmin, homogeneity index) were improved with an increasing number of PCRL/PCRV, but with PCRL being more robust. Conclusions: PCRL requires a longer treatment time than PCRV for high numbers of rescannings in the NIRS scanning system but is more robust. Although four or more rescans provided good dose homogeneity and conformity, the authors prefer to use more rescannings for clinical cases to further minimize dose degradation effects due to organ motion.",

abstract="Purpose Water equivalent path length (WEL) variations due to respiration can change the range of a charged particle beam and result in beam overshoot to critical organs or beam undershoot to tumor. We have studied range fluctuations by analyzing four-dimensional computed tomography data and quantitatively assessing potential beam overshoot.Methods and Materials The maximal intensity volume is calculated by combining the gross tumor volume contours at each respiratory phase in the four-dimensional computed tomography study. The first target volume calculates the maximal intensity volume for the entire respiratory cycle (internal target volume [ITV]-radiotherapy [RT]), and the second target volume is the maximal intensity volume corresponding to gated RT (gated-RT, {\textasciitilde}30\% phase window around exhalation). A compensator at each respiratory phase is calculated. Two ``composite'' compensators for ITV-RT and gated-RT are then designed by selecting the minimal compensator depth at the respective respiratory phase. These compensators are then applied to the four-dimensional computed tomography data to estimate beam penetration. Analysis metrics include range fluctuation and overshoot volume, both as a function of gantry angle. We compared WEL fluctuations observed in treating the ITV-RT versus gated-RT in 11 lung patients.Results The WEL fluctuations were <21.8 mm-WEL and 9.5 mm-WEL for ITV-RT and gated-RT, respectively for all patients. Gated-RT reduced the beam overshoot volume by approximately a factor of four compared with ITV-RT. Such range fluctuations can affect the efficacy of treatment and result in an excessive dose to a distal critical organ.Conclusion Time varying range fluctuation analysis provides information useful for determining appropriate patient-specific treatment parameters in charged particle RT. This analysis can also be useful for optimizing planning and delivery",

abstract="Respiratory motion limits the potential of modern high-precision radiotherapy techniques such as IMRT and particle therapy. Due to the uncertainty of tumour localization, the ability of achieving dose conformation often cannot be exploited sufficiently, especially in the case of lung tumours. Various methods have been proposed to track the position of tumours using external signals, e.g. with the help of a respiratory belt or by observing external markers. Retrospectively gated time-resolved x-ray computed tomography (4D CT) studies prior to therapy can be used to register the external signals with the tumour motion. However, during treatment the actual motion of internal structures may be different. Direct control of tissue motion by online imaging during treatment promises more precise information. On the other hand, it is more complex, since a larger amount of data must be processed in order to determine the motion. Three major questions arise from this issue. Firstly, can the motion that has occurred be precisely determined in the images? Secondly, how large must, respectively how small can, the observed region be chosen to get a reliable signal? Finally, is it possible to predict the proximate tumour location within sufficiently short acquisition times to make this information available for gating irradiation? Based on multiple studies on a porcine lung phantom, we have tried to examine these questions carefully. We found a basic characteristic of the breathing cycle in images using the image similarity method normalized mutual information. Moreover, we examined the performance of the calculations and proposed an image-based gating technique. In this paper, we present the results and validation performed with a real patient data set. This allows for the conclusion that it is possible to build up a gating system based on image data, solely, or (at least in avoidance of an exceeding exposure dose) to verify gates proposed by the various external systems",

abstract="PURPOSE: Proton beams can potentially increase the dose delivered to lung tumors without increasing the dose to critical normal tissues because protons can be stopped before encountering the normal tissues. This potential can only be realized if tissue motion and planning uncertainties are correctly included during planning. This study evaluated several planning strategies to determine which method best provides adequate tumor coverage, minimal normal tissue irradiation, and simplicity of use. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Proton beam treatment plans were generated using one or more of three different planning strategies. These strategies included designing apertures and boluses to the PTV, apertures to the PTV and boluses to the CTV, and aperture and bolus to the CTV. RESULTS: The planning target volume as specified in ICRU Report 50 can be used only to design the lateral margins of beams, because the distal and proximal margins resulting from CT number uncertainty, beam range uncertainty, tissue motions, and setup uncertainties, are different than the lateral margins resulting from these same factors. The best strategy for target coverage with the planning tools available overirradiated some normal tissues unnecessarily. The available tools also made the planning of lung tumors difficult. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that inclusion of target motion and setup uncertainties into a plan should be performed in the beam design step instead of creating new targets. New computerized treatment planning system tools suggested by this study will ease planning, facilitate abandonment of the PTV concept, improve conformance of the dose distribution to the target, and improve conformal avoidance of critical normal tissues",

Interest to date has heavily focused on the initial case identification, but more recent reports have suggested that the issues with case work-up and surgical management also bear closer consideration.

abstract="To evaluate the effect of breath-holding on the short-term reproducibility and long-term variability of tumor position during image-guided radiosurgery. Thirteen patients have undergone single-fraction radiosurgery treatments during which the tumor was repeatedly imaged radiographically to observe its position. The imaging data were used to monitor the efficacy of breath-holding and to periodically readjust the alignment of the treatment beam with the tumor. These measurements have allowed the effects of breathing, heartbeat, patient movement, and instrumental uncertainties to be separately identified in the record of tumor position. During inspiration breath-holding, the lung tumor position was reproducible to within 1 mm, on average, in the direction of maximum displacement during regular breathing, and to within 1.8 mm in three dimensions overall. The pancreas tumor position in three dimensions was reproducible to within 2.5 mm on average. Some patients showed a slow, steady drift of tumor position during the extended sequence of breath-holds, which was compensated by periodic retargeting of the treatment beam. Breath-holding can allow the reduction of tumor motion dosimetry margins to 2 mm or less for lung cancer treatments, provided that the treatment system can detect and adapt to long-term variations in the mean tumor position during a lengthy treatment fraction",

Compensation strategies include beam gating, collimator tracking and robotic beam re-alignment. All of these schemes have a system latency of up to several hundred milliseconds, which calls in turn for predictive control loops. Irregularities in breathing make prediction difficult. We have evaluated the performance of two classes of control loop algorithms-the linear adaptive filter and the adaptive nonlinear neural network-for highly irregular patient breathing behaviours. The neural network demonstrated robust adaptability to all of the observed breathing patterns while the linear filter failed in a significant percentage of cases. For those cases where the linear filter could function, it made less accurate predictions than the neural network. Because the neural network presents no additional computational burden in the control loop we conclude that it is the preferred choice among heuristic predictive algorithms",

abstract="Radiographic image guidance has emerged as the new paradigm for patient positioning, target localization, and external beam alignment in radiotherapy. Although widely varied in modality and method, all radiographic guidance techniques have one thing in common--they can give a significant radiation dose to the patient. As with all medical uses of ionizing radiation, the general view is that this exposure should be carefully managed. The philosophy for dose management adopted by the diagnostic imaging community is summarized by the acronym ALARA, i.e., as low as reasonably achievable. But unlike the general situation with diagnostic imaging and image-guided surgery, image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) adds the imaging dose to an already high level of therapeutic radiation. There is furthermore an interplay between increased imaging and improved therapeutic dose conformity that suggests the possibility of optimizing rather than simply minimizing the imaging dose. For this reason, the management of imaging dose during radiotherapy is a different problem than its management during routine diagnostic or image-guided surgical procedures. The imaging dose received as part of a radiotherapy treatment has long been regarded as negligible and thus has been quantified in a fairly loose manner. On the other hand, radiation oncologists examine the therapy dose distribution in minute detail. The introduction of more intensive imaging procedures for IGRT now obligates the clinician to evaluate therapeutic and imaging doses in a more balanced manner. This task group is charged with addressing the issue of radiation dose delivered via image guidance techniques during radiotherapy. The group has developed this charge into three objectives: (1) Compile an overview of image-guidance techniques and their associated radiation dose levels, to provide the clinician using a particular set of image guidance techniques with enough data to estimate the total diagnostic dose for a specific treatment scenario, (2) identify ways to reduce the total imaging dose without sacrificing essential imaging information, and (3) recommend optimization strategies to trade off imaging dose with improvements in therapeutic dose delivery. The end goal is to enable the design of image guidance regimens that are as effective and efficient as possible",

Methods: In this randomized Phase II trial (planned sample size 66 pts), chemotherapy-naive pts. with primary inoperable locally advanced pancreatic cancer were eligible. For both arms initial treatment consisted of radiotherapy, gemcitabine weekly (300 mg/m2), and cetuximab weekly (loading dose 400 mg/m2 day 1, concomitant with RT 250 mg/m2). After trimodal therapy pts in arm A received gemcitabine weekly (1,000 mg/m2) over 4 weeks, and pts in study arm B received gemcitabine weekly (1,000 mg/m2) over 4 weeks and cetuximab (250 mg/m2) weekly over 12 weeks. IMRT was delivered using an integrated boost concept (54 Gy GTV, 45 Gy CTV) over 5 weeks. Response evaluation (CT) followed at week 12 and every 3 months. All pts were treated with gemcitabine weekly (1,000 mg/m2) over 3 months after end of study. Primary study end point was response; secondary end points were overall survival, secondary resection rate and adverse events. Results: Between 2/05 and 4/07 68 pts were enrolled (characteristics: pancreatic adenocarcinoma c2 T4 N1 68/68, median age = 62 (range 48-79); M/F = 38/30; ECOG PS 0/1/2 = 17/45/6). Complete response in 1/68, partial response in 23/68, no change in 41/68 and progressive disease in 3/68 pts was found according the RECIST criteria in the CT controls. Median follow-up at present is 11 months, 1-and 2- year survival is 61\% and 20 \%, respectively, median survival is 15 months. No statistical significance was reached concerning overall survival between the treatment arms. 40/68 pts were amenable for secondary potentially curative resection. 14 pts could be resected. Overall toxicity was acceptable and consistent with the profiles of the individual agents. Conclusions: Trimodal therapy for primary inoperable locally advanced inoperable pancreatic carcinoma is safe and resulted in excellent local control and overall survival. No statistical significant difference between the two treatment arms could be found. Distant metastases were the main cause of failure. No significant financial relationships to disclose",

However, no proof of this effect has been provided by clinical trials and related clinical research. Hence, we investigated the radiation biological aspects of high LET carbon beam therapy on cervical cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This study involved 49 patients with stage IIIb bulky and stage IVa cervical cancer treated with high LET carbon beams between October 1995 and June 2000. Oxygen partial pressure (pO(2)) was measured by using a needle-type polarographic oxygen electrode. RESULTS: The 4-year disease-free survival rates of patients with pO(2) </= 20 mm Hg (hypoxic tumor) and pO(2) > 20 mm Hg (oxygenated tumor) before treatment were 37\% and 21\%, respectively. The local control rates of hypoxic and oxygenated tumors before treatment were 58\% and 54\%, respectively. The disease-free survival rates of hypoxic and oxygenated tumors assessed by oxygen status at the 5th day of irradiation were 33\% and 32\%, respectively. The local control rates of hypoxic and oxygenated tumors at the 5th day were 60\% and 58\%, respectively. There was no significant prognostic difference between hypoxic and oxygenated tumors. CONCLUSION: The similar disease-free survival and local control rates between hypoxic and oxygenated tumors before and during treatment indicated that the role of the tumor oxygenation status was not so important in local control in carbon beam therapy. These results indicated that high LET carbon beam irradiation might reduce the radiation-resistant nature stemming from tumor hypoxia",

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate in a retrospective review the role of proton beam therapy for patients with medically inoperable Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: From November 2001 to July 2008, 55 medically inoperable patients with Stage I NSCLC were treated with proton beam therapy. A total of 58 (T1/T2, 30/28) tumors were treated. The median age of study participants was 77 years (range, 52-86 years). A total dose of 66 GyE in 10 fractions was given to peripherally located tumors and 72.6 GyE in 22 fractions to centrally located tumors. RESULTS: The rates (95\% confidence interval) of overall and progression-free survival of all patients and of local control of all tumors at 2 years were 97.8\% (93.6-102.0\%), 88.7\% (77.9-99.5\%), and 97.0\% (91.1-102.8\%), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in progression-free rate between T1 and T2 tumors (p = 0.87). Two patients (3.6\%) had deterioration in pulmonary function, and 2 patients (3.6\%) had Grade 3 pneumonitis. CONCLUSION: Proton beam therapy was effective and well tolerated in medically inoperable patients with Stage I NSCLC",

abstract="Purpose: To evaluate the daily setup accuracy and the reduction of respiratory tumor movement using a body frame in conformal therapy for solitary lung tumor.Methods and Materials: Eighteen patients with a solitary lung tumor underwent conformal therapy using a body frame. The body shell of the frame was shaped to the patient?s body contour. The respiratory tumor movement was estimated using fluoroscopy, and if it was greater than 5 mm, pressure was applied to the patient?s abdomen with the goal of minimizing tumor movement. CT images were then obtained, and a treatment planning was made. A total dose of 40 or 48 Gy was delivered in 4 fractions. Portal films were obtained at each treatment, and the field displacements between them and the simulation films were measured for daily setup errors. The patients were repositioned if the setup error was greater than 3 mm. Correlations were analyzed between patient characteristics and the tumor movement, or the tumor movement reduction and the daily setup errors.Results: Respiratory tumor movement ranged from 0 to 20 mm (mean 7.7 mm). The abdominal press reduced the tumor movement significantly from a range of 8 to 20 mm to a range of 2 to 11 mm (p = 0.0002). Daily setup errors were within 5 mm in 90\%, 100\%, and 93\% of all verifications in left-right, anterior-posterior, and cranio-caudal directions, respectively. Patient repositioning was performed in 25\% of all treatments. No significant correlation was detected between patient characteristics and tumor movement, tumor movement reduction, and the daily setup errors.Conclusions: The abdominal press was successful in reducing the respiratory tumor movement. Daily setup accuracy using the body frame was acceptable. Verification should be performed at each treatment in hypofractionated conformal therapy",

pages="1644--1648",
abstract="This study proposes a new method to reduce respiratory motion artifacts in PET images of lung cancer. The method is referred to as respiratory-correlated dynamic PET (RCDPET). RCDPET enables the acquisition of 4-dimensional PET data without the need for a respiratory tracking device. In this article, we compare this method with respiratory-gated PET (RGPET). Both methods provide the ability to correct for motion artifacts and more accurately quantitate radiotracer uptake within lung lesions. Both methods were evaluated in phantom studies and 1 patient. Methods: With RCDPET, data are acquired in consecutive 1-s time frames. A point source attached to a rigid foam block is set on the patient?s abdomen and is extended into the camera field of view at the level of the lesion by means of a low-density rod. The position of this source is used to track respiratory motion through the consecutive dynamic frames. Image frames corresponding to a user-selected lesion position within the breathing cycle, in correlation with the point source position, are then identified after scanning. The sinograms of the selected image frames are summed and then reconstructed using iterative reconstruction with segmented attenuation correction. Results: The results from phantom studies with both RGPET and RCDPET were within 10\% agreement, for both activity quantitation and image noise levels. In a clinical application, the quantitation of the SUVmax and the lesion?s size showed a 6\% and 2\% difference, respectively, between RCDPET and RGPET measurements. Conclusion: RCDPET can be considered as a comparable, or alternative, method to RGPET in reducing the smearing effects due to respiration and improving quantitation of PET in the thorax. One advantage of RCDPET over RGPET is the ability to retrospectively reconstruct the PET data at any phase or amplitude in the breathing cycle",

title="Synchronized moving aperture radiation therapy (SMART): average tumour trajectory for lung patients",
journal="Physics in Medicine and Biology",
year="2003",
volume="48",
number="5",
pages="587--598",
abstract="Synchronized moving aperture radiation therapy (SMART) is a new technique for treating mobile tumours under development at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The basic idea of SMART is to synchronize the moving radiation beam aperture formed by a dynamic multileaf collimator (DMLC) with the tumour motion induced by respiration. SMART is based on the concept of the average tumour trajectory (ATT) exhibited by a tumour during respiration. During the treatment simulation stage, tumour motion is measured and the ATT is derived. Then, the original IMRT MLC leaf sequence is modified using the ATT to compensate for tumour motion. During treatment, the tumour motion is monitored. The treatment starts when leaf motion and tumour motion are synchronized at a specific breathing phase. The treatment will halt when the tumour drifts away from the ATT and will resume when the synchronization between tumour motion and radiation beam is re-established. In this paper, we present a method to derive the ATT from measured tumour trajectory data. We also investigate the validity of the ATT concept for lung tumours during normal breathing. The lung tumour trajectory data were acquired during actual radiotherapy sessions using a real-time tumour-tracking system. SMART treatment is simulated by assuming that the radiation beam follows the derived ATT and the tumour follows the measured trajectory. In simulation, the treatment starts at exhale phase. The duty cycle of SMART delivery was calculated for various treatment times and gating thresholds, as well as for various exhale phases where the treatment begins. The simulation results show that in the case of free breathing, for 4 out of 11 lung datasets with tumour motion greater than 1 cm from peak to peak, the error in tumour tracking can be controlled to within a couple of millimetres while maintaining a reasonable delivery efficiency. That is to say, without any breath coaching/control, the ATT is a valid concept for some lung tumours. However, to make SMART an efficient technique in general, it is found that breath coaching techniques are required",

abstract="Primary cardiac neoplasms are rare and occur less commonly than metastatic disease of the heart. In this overview, current published studies concerning malignant neoplasms of the heart are reviewed, together with some insights into their aetiology, diagnosis and management. We searched medline using the subject 'cardiac neoplasms'. We selected about 110 articles from between 1973 and 2006, of which 76 sources were used to complete the review. Sarcomas are the most common cardiac tumours and include myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, angiosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, neurofibrosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma and undifferentiated sarcoma. The classic symptoms of cardiac tumours are intracardiac obstruction, signs of systemic embolisation, and systemic or constitutional symptoms. However, serious complications including stroke, myocardial infarction and even sudden death from arrhythmia may be the first signs of a tumour. Echocardiography and angiography are essential diagnostic tools for evaluating cardiac neoplasms. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies have improved the diagnostic approach in recent decades. Successful treatment for benign cardiac tumours is usually achieved by surgical resection. Unfortunately, resection of the tumour is not always feasible. The prognosis after surgery is usually excellent in the case of benign tumours, but the prognosis of malignant tumours remains dismal. In conclusion, there are limited published data concerning cardiac neoplasms. Therefore, a high level of suspicion is required for early diagnosis. Surgery is the cornerstone of therapy. However, a multi-treatment approach, including chemotherapy, radiation as well as evolving approaches such as gene therapy, might provide a better palliative and curative result",

abstract="In radiation therapy (RT), staging, treatment planning, monitoring and evaluation of response are traditionally based on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These radiological investigations have the significant advantage to show the anatomy with a high resolution, being also called anatomical imaging. In recent years, so called biological imaging methods which visualize metabolic pathways have been developed. These methods offer complementary imaging of various aspects of tumour biology. To date, the most prominent biological imaging system in use is positron emission tomography (PET), whose diagnostic properties have clinically been evaluated for years. The aim of this review is to discuss the valences and implications of PET in RT. We will focus our evaluation on the following topics: the role of biological imaging for tumour tissue detection/delineation of the gross tumour volume (GTV) and for the visualization of heterogeneous tumour biology. We will discuss the role of fluorodeoxyglucose-PET in lung and head and neck cancer and the impact of amino acids (AA)-PET in target volume delineation of brain gliomas. Furthermore, we summarize the data of the literature about tumour hypoxia and proliferation visualized by PET. We conclude that, regarding treatment planning in radiotherapy, PET offers advantages in terms of tumour delineation and the description of biological processes. However, to define the real impact of biological imaging on clinical outcome after radiotherapy, further experimental, clinical and cost/benefit analyses are required",

The objective of this study was to determine what types of implantable markers are visible in setup radiographs and, at the same time, perturb the therapeutic proton dose to the prostate by less than 10\%. The radiographic visibility of the markers was assessed by visual inspection of lateral setup radiographs of a pelvic phantom using a kilovoltage x-ray imaging system. The fiducial-induced perturbations in the proton dose were estimated with Monte Carlo simulations. The influence of marker material, size, placement depth and orientation within the pelvis was examined. The radiographic tests confirmed that gold and stainless steel markers were clearly visible and that titanium markers were not. The Monte Carlo simulations revealed that titanium and stainless steel markers minimally perturbed the proton beam, but gold markers cast unacceptably large dose shadows. A 0.9 mm diameter, 3.1 mm long cylindrical stainless steel marker provides good radiographic visibility yet perturbs the proton dose distribution in the prostate by less than 8\% when using a parallel opposed lateral beam arrangement",

abstract="PURPOSE: To describe prostate deformation during radiotherapy and determine the margins required to account for prostate deformation after setup to intraprostatic fiducial markers (FM). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-five patients with T1c-T2c prostate cancer had three gold FMs implanted. The patients presented with a full bladder and empty rectum for two axial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans using a gradient recalled echo (GRE) sequence capable of imaging the FMs. The MRIs were done at the time of radiotherapy (RT) planning and a randomly assigned fraction. A single observer contoured the prostate surfaces. They were entered into a finite element model and aligned using the centroid of the three FMs. RESULTS: During RT, the prostate volume decreased by 0.5\%/fraction (p = 0.03) and the FMs in-migrated by 0.05 mm/fraction (p < 0.05). Prostate deformation was unrelated to differential bladder and bowel filling, but was related to a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) (p = 0.003). The standard deviation for systematic uncertainty of prostate surface contouring was 0.8 mm and for FM centroid localization was 0.4 mm. The standard deviation of random interfraction prostate deformation was 1.5 mm and for FM centroid variability was 1.1 mm. These uncertainties from prostate deformation can be incorporated into a margin recipe to determine the total margins required for RT. CONCLUSIONS: During RT, the prostate exhibited: volume decrease, deformation, and in-migration of FMs. Patients with TURPs were prone to prostate deformation",

The sampling techniques we consider are uniform distribution of points on a regular Cartesian grid and random selection of points. For three-dimensional treatment planning, random sampling leads to a significant reduction in estimation error and/or in the number of calculation points necessary to achieve a required accuracy. We discuss advantages and drawbacks of random sampling, as compared to sampling on a regular grid. It is suggested that, in practical situations, at least 50 times fewer randomly sampled points per organ/volume of interest are needed for fast estimation of complication probability with the same accuracy, i.e., not exceeding 5\% (within 95\% confidence limits) in the worst case",

We have developed a concept of a dose-volume distribution (DVD) and its corresponding differential dose-volume distribution (DDVD), based on organization of the data in the volume rather than in the dose domain. The new concepts make full use of the information that can be obtained from the dose calculation points and the sampling pattern and are designed to overcome shortcomings of the classical concepts of dose-volume histograms (DVH) and differential dose-volume histograms (DDVH). The new concepts can be applied to any number of dose calculation points, but they are especially advantageous when a small number of points is used. DVDs are particularly well suited to pseudo- and quasi-random sampling of dose distributions. We have developed an error analysis for DVDs and DDVDs in the case of pseudorandom sampling. We also describe an adaptive technique for minimizing the amount of data needed for purposes of display",

abstract="Modern treatment planning systems for three-dimensional treatment planning provide three-dimensionally accurate dose distributions for each individual patient. These data open up new possibilities for more precise reporting and analysis of doses actually delivered to irradiated organs and volumes of interest. A new method of summarizing and reporting inhomogeneous dose distributions is reported here. The concept of equivalent uniform dose (EUD) assumes that any two dose distributions are equivalent if they cause the same radiobiological effect. In this paper the EUD concept for tumors is presented, for which the probability of local control is assumed to be determined by the expected number of surviving clonogens, according to Poisson statistics. The EUD can be calculated directly from the dose calculation points or, from the corresponding dose-volume distributions (histograms). The fraction of clonogens surviving a dose of 2 Gy (SF2) is chosen to be the primary operational parameter characterizing radiosensitivity of clonogens. The application of the EUD concept is demonstrated on a clinical dataset. The causes of flattening of the observed dose-response curves become apparent since the EUD concept reveals the finer structure of the analyzed group of patients in respect to the irradiated volumes and doses actually received. Extensions of the basic EUD concept to include nonuniform density of clonogens, dose per fraction effects, repopulation of clonogens, and inhomogeneity of patient population are discussed and compared with the basic formula",

abstract="OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of high-dose radiotherapy for prostate cancer using proton boost therapy following photon radiotherapy. METHODS: The primary endpoint was acute grade 3 or greater genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities. The study included patients with clinical stage T1-3N0M0 prostate cancer. Radiotherapy consisted of 50 Gy/25 fx photon irradiation to the prostate and the bilateral seminal vesicles followed by proton boost of 26 Gy(E)/13 fx to the prostate alone. Hormonal therapy was allowed before and during the radiation therapy. RESULTS: Between January 2001 and January 2003, 30 patients were enrolled in this study. Acute grade 1/2 GU and GI toxicities were observed in 20/4 and 17/0 patients, respectively. With the median follow-up period of 30 months (range 20-45), late grade 1/2 GU and GI toxicities occurred in 2/3 and 8/3 patients, respectively. No grade 3 or greater acute or late toxicities were observed. All patients were alive, but six patients relapsed biochemically after 7-24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Proton boost therapy following photon radiotherapy for prostate cancer is feasible. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of proton beam therapy, a multi-institutional phase II trial is in progress in Japan",

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate retrospectively the safety and efficacy of high-dose proton beam therapy (PBT) for Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1999 and 2003, 37 patients were treated in our institution. The indications for PBT were pathologically proven NSCLC, clinical Stage I, tumor size < or =5 cm, medically inoperable or refusal of surgery, and written informed consent. A total dose of 70-94 Gy(E) was delivered in 20 fractions (3.5-4.9 Gy(E) per fraction). RESULTS: Patient characteristics (number of patients) were as follows: Stage IA/IB, 17 of 20; medically inoperable/refusal of surgery, 23/14; total dose 70/80/88/94 Gy(E), 3/17/16/1. With a median follow-up period of 24 months, the 2-year local progression-free and overall survival rates were 80\% and 84\%, respectively. The 2-year locoregional relapse-free survival rates in Stage IA and Stage IB were 79\% and 60\%, respectively. No serious acute toxicity was observed. Late Grades 2 and 3 pulmonary toxicities were observed in 3 patients each. Of these 6 patients, 5 had Stage IB disease. CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy is a promising treatment modality for Stage I NSCLC, though locoregional relapse and late pulmonary toxicities in Stage IB patients were substantial. Further investigation of PBT for Stage I NSCLC is warranted",

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate the first clinical results of an off-line adaptive radiotherapy (ART) protocol for prostate cancer using kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) in combination with a diet and mild laxatives. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-three patients began treatment with a planning target volume (PTV) margin of 10 mm. The CBCT scans acquired during the first six fractions were used to generate an average prostate clinical target volume (AV-CTV), and average rectum (AV-Rect). Using these structures, a new treatment plan was generated with a 7-mm PTV margin. Weekly CBCT scans were used to monitor the CTV coverage. A diet and mild laxatives were introduced to improve image quality and reduce prostate motion. RESULTS: Twenty patients were treated with conform ART protocol. For these patients, 91\% of the CBCT scans could be used to calculate the AV-CTV and AV-Rect. In 96\% of the follow-up CBCT scans, the CTV was located within the average PTV. In the remaining 4\%, the prostate extended the PTV by a maximum of 1 mm. Systematic and random errors for organ motion were reduced by a factor of two compared with historical data without diet and laxatives. An average PTV reduction of 29\% was achieved. The volume of the AV-Rect that received >65 Gy was reduced by 19\%. The mean dose to the anal wall was reduced on average by 4.8 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: We safely reduced the high-dose region by 29\%. The reduction in irradiated volume led to a significant reduction in the dose to the rectum. The diet and laxatives improved the image quality and tended to reduce prostate motion",

abstract="Estimation of exposure due to environmental and other sources of radiations of high-LET and low-LET is of interest in radiobiology and radiation protection for risk assessment. To account for the differences in effectiveness of different types of radiations various parameters have been used. However, the relative inadequacy of the commonly used parameters, including dose, fluence, linear energy transfer, lineal energy, specific energy and quality factor, has been made manifest by the biological importance of the microscopic track structure and primary modes of interaction. Monte Carlo track structure simulations have been used to calculate the frequency of energy deposition by radiations of high- and low-LET in target sizes similar to DNA and higher order genomic structure. Tracks of monoenergetic heavy ions and electrons were constructed by following the molecular interaction-by-interaction histories of the particles down to 10 eV. Subsequently, geometrical models of these assumed biological targets were randomly exposed to the radiation tracks and the frequency of energy depositions obtained were normalized to unit dose in unit density liquid water (l0(3) kg m-3). From these data and a more sophisticated model of the DNA, absolute yields of both single- and double-strand breaks expressed in number of breaks per dalton per Gray were obtained and compared with the measured yields. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for energy depositions in cylindrical targets has been calculated using 100 keV electrons as the reference radiation assuming the electron track-ends contribution is similar to that in 250 kV X-ray or Co60 gamma-ray irradiations",

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of raster scanned heavy charged particle therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa,) with special regard to the influence of internal organ motion on the dose distribution. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The CT data of 8 patients with PCa who underwent three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (RT) were chosen. In addition to the routine treatment planning scan, three to five additional positioning control CT scans were performed. The organs at risk and the target volumes were defined on all CT scans. Primary and boost carbon ion plans were calculated to deliver 66 Gy to the clinical target volume/planning target volume, with an additional 10 Gy to the gross tumor volume (GTV). To estimate the influence of internal organ motion on plan quality, the dose was recalculated on the basis of the control CT scans. The comparative analysis was based on the dose-volume histogram-derived physical parameters. RESULTS: The average 90\% target coverage was 99.1\% for the GTV. The maximal dose to the rectum was 71.8 Gy. The average rectal mean dose was 19 Gy. The volume of the rectum receiving 70 and 68 Gy was 0.1 and 0.3 cm3. The average difference in the 90\% coverage for the GTV on control CT cubes was 3.6\%. The maximal rectal dose increased to 76.2 Gy. The deviation in the mean rectal dose was <1 Gy on average. The rectal volume receiving 70 and 68 Gy increased to 2.5 and 3.3 cm3. CONCLUSION: The investigation demonstrated the feasibility of raster scanned carbon ions for PCa RT. Excellent coverage of the target volume and optimal sparing of the rectum were acquired. The combination of photon intensity-modulated RT and a carbon ion boost to the GTV is the most rational solution for the gain of clinical experience in heavy ion RT for PCa patients",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Carbon ion ((12)C) therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer (PC) might result in an improved outcome as compared to low linear energy transfer irradiation techniques. In this study, we present the first interim report of acute side effects of the first intermediate-risk PC patients treated at the GSI (Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung) and the University of Heidelberg in an ongoing clinical phase I/II trial using combined photon intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and (12)C carbon ion boost. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fourteen patients (planned accrual: 31 pts) have been treated within this trial so far. IMRT is prescribed to the median PTV at a dose of 30 x 2 Gy; (12)C boost is applied to the prostate (GTV) at a dose of 6 x 3 GyE using raster scan technique. Safety margins added to the clinical target volume were determined individually for each patient based on five independent planning computed tomography (CT)-scans. Acute gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity was assessed and documented according to the CTCAE Version 3.0. RESULTS: Radiotherapy was very well tolerated without any grade 3 or higher toxicity. Acute anal bleeding grade 2 was observed in 2/14 patients. Rectal tenesmus grade 1 was reported by three other patients. No further GI symptoms have been observed. Most common acute symptoms during radiotherapy were nocturia and dysuria CTC grade 1 and 2 (12/14). There was no severe acute GU toxicity. CONCLUSION: The combination of photon IMRT and carbon ion boost is feasible in patients with intermediate-risk PC. So far, the treatment has been well tolerated. Acute toxicity rates were in good accordance with data reported for high dose IMRT alone",

abstract="One aim of adaptive radiotherapy (ART) is the observation of organ motion followed by a subsequent adaptation of the treatment plan. One way of achieving this goal is a kV x-ray source mounted at a linear accelerator in combination with a flat-panel imager. Two imaging hardware configurations were evaluated for their potential for online tracking and the subsequent correction of organ motion by using fluoroscopic images: x-ray tube positioned with (A) 90{\'Y} and (B) 180{\'Y} offset to the MV beam. For one lung case two IMRT plans with five coplanar beams and the table positioned at 0{\'Y} were optimized for two multileaf collimators (MLCs) with 10 mm and 2.75 mm leaf width. Respiratory motion, modelled by rigid transformation in the lungs, was investigated for different amplitudes. The 3D dose distributions for different cases (no movement, uncorrected movement, correction for the movement perpendicular to the respective kV beam) were evaluated with the help of dose volume histograms (DVHs) and a modified conformity (Baltas et al 1998 Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 40 515\&ndash;24) and coverage index using the 90\% isodose. For the corrected treatment plans the influence of the observed displacement vector caused by organ movement was accounted for by a respective displacement of the target point. For the simulated movement with a small amplitude (3 mm) in the anterior\&ndash;posterior (AP) direction the dose distributions resulting from the correction of the displacement vector using imaging system A or B showed similar results for both systems and were in good agreement with the dose distribution of the static (not moving) patient. Increasing the amplitude in the AP direction to 6 mm or even 9 mm leads for both amplitudes and both MLCs to almost the same conformity and coverage index as the static dose distribution if imaging system B is used for the online correction. For the dose distribution obtained with correction based on imaging system A the deviation between the optimal and the corrected dose distribution is increasing with increasing amplitude. For the MLC with the smaller leaf width the difference between the optimal and the corrected dose distributions is always significantly larger than for the less conformal dose distributions created by the MLC with the 10 mm leaves. These results can be explained by the fact that system A cannot observe movement in the AP\&ndash;LR plane perpendicular to the MV beam and therefore cannot correct for these movements whereas system B only fails to observe the motion in the beam direction which for photon irradiation has less impact on the dose distribution",

abstract="The contribution of organ and tumour motion to the degradation of planned dose distributions during radiotherapy to the breathing lung has been experimentally investigated and quantified. An anthropomorphic, tissue-equivalent breathing phantom with deformable lungs has been built, in which the lung tumour can be driven in any arbitrary 3D trajectory. The trajectory is programmed into a motion controller connected to a high-precision moving platform that is connected to the tumour. The motion controller is connected to the accelerator's dose counter and the speed of motion is scaled to the dose rate. This ensures consistent delivery despite variation in either the dose rate or inter-segment timing. For this study, the phantom was made to breathe by a set of periodic equations representing respiratory motion by an asymmetric, trigonometric function. Several motion amplitudes were selected to be applied in the primary axis of motion. Five three-dimensional, geometrically conformal (3DCRT) fractions with different starting phases (spaced uniformly in the breathing cycle) were delivered to the phantom and compared to a delivery where the phantom was static at the end-expiration position. A set of intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans (IMRT) was subsequently delivered in the same manner. Bigger amplitudes of motion resulted in a higher degree of dose blurring. Severe underdosages were observed when deliberately selecting the PTV wrongly, their extent being correlated with the degree of margin error. IMRT motion-averaged dose distributions exhibited areas of high dose in the gross tumour volume (GTV) which were not present in the static irradiations, arising from booster segments that the optimizer was creating to achieve planning target volume (PTV) homogeneity during the inverse-planning process. 3DCRT, on the other hand, did not demonstrate such effects. It has been concluded that care should be taken to control the delivered fluence when delivering IMRT to the breathing lung, even when the PTV margin has been adequately chosen to include the extent of the breathing motion",

abstract="Proton therapy is one form of radiotherapy in which the irradiation can be concentrated on a tumor using a scanned or modulated Bragg peak. Therefore, it is very important to evaluate the proton-irradiated volume accurately. The proton-irradiated volume can be confirmed by detection of pair annihilation gamma rays from positron emitter nuclei generated by the target nuclear fragment reaction of irradiated proton nuclei and nuclei in the irradiation target using a positron emission tomography (PET) apparatus, and dose-volume delivery guided proton therapy (DGPT) can thereby be achieved using PET images. In the proton treatment room, a beam ON-LINE PET system (BOLPs) was constructed so that a PET apparatus of the planar-type with a high spatial resolution of about 2 mm was mounted with the field of view covering the isocenter of the beam irradiation system. The position and intensity of activity were measured using the BOLPs immediately after the proton irradiation of a gelatinous water target containing 16O nuclei at different proton irradiation energy levels. The change of the activity-distribution range against the change of the physical range was observed within 2 mm. The experiments of proton irradiation to a rabbit and the imaging of the activity were performed. In addition, the proton beam energy used to irradiate the rabbit was changed. When the beam condition was changed, the difference between the two images acquired from the measurement of the BOLPs was confirmed to clearly identify the proton-irradiated volume",

abstract="PURPOSE: To verify the usefulness of our developed beam ON-LINE positron emission tomography (PET) system mounted on a rotating gantry port (BOLPs-RGp) for dose-volume delivery-guided proton therapy (DGPT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: In the proton treatment room at our facility, a BOLPs-RGp was constructed so that a planar PET apparatus could be mounted with its field of view covering the iso-center of the beam irradiation system. Activity measurements were performed in 48 patients with tumors of the head and neck, liver, lungs, prostate, and brain. The position and intensity of the activity were measured using the BOLPs-RGp during the 200 s immediately after the proton irradiation. RESULTS: The daily measured activity images acquired by the BOLPs-RGp showed the proton irradiation volume in each patient. Changes in the proton-irradiated volume were indicated by differences between a reference activity image (taken at the first treatment) and the daily activity-images. In the case of head-and-neck treatment, the activity distribution changed in the areas where partial tumor reduction was observed. In the case of liver treatment, it was observed that the washout effect in necrotic tumor cells was slower than in non-necrotic tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: The BOLPs-RGp was developed for the DGPT. The accuracy of proton treatment was evaluated by measuring changes of daily measured activity. Information about the positron-emitting nuclei generated during proton irradiation can be used as a basis for ensuring the high accuracy of irradiation in proton treatment",

Therefore, it is very important to evaluate the proton-irradiated volume accurately. The proton-irradiated volume can be confirmed by detection of pair-annihilation gamma rays from positron-emitting nuclei generated by the nuclear fragmentation reaction of the incident protons on target nuclei using a PET apparatus. The activity of the positron-emitting nuclei generated in a patient was measured with a PET-CT apparatus after proton beam irradiation of the patient. Activity measurement was performed in patients with tumors of the brain, head and neck, liver, lungs, and sacrum. The 3-D PET image obtained on the CT image showed the visual correspondence with the irradiation area of the proton beam. Moreover, it was confirmed that there were differences in the strength of activity from the PET-CT images obtained at each irradiation site. The values of activity obtained from both measurement and calculation based on the reaction cross section were compared, and it was confirmed that the intensity and the distribution of the activity changed with the start time of the PET imaging after proton beam irradiation. The clinical use of this information about the positron-emitting nuclei will be important for promoting proton treatment with higher accuracy in the future",

abstract="PURPOSE: For optimal respiratory-gated radiotherapy, exhale fluctuation was assessed by monitoring internal fiducials in a synchronized internal/external marker detection system. METHODS: Synchronized internal/external position data were collected during the entire course of treatments for 12 lung patients with 24 fiducials. Baseline was determined in the exhale phase during pre-treatment observation time, and a gating level of external waves was set in each treatment session in a simulation of respiratory-gated radiotherapy. Patients were treated under a real-time tumor-tracking (RTRT) system with an external (abdominal) respiratory motion detector. In the simulation, external gating windows were defined as those below the 30\% amplitude level (i.e., imaginary beams would be triggered when part of the respiratory wave falls into this window). Exhale fluctuation (EF) was defined as the phenomenon in which the lowest point of the external wave crossed downward past the pre-determined baseline. Gating efficiency (GE) was defined as the ratio between the amount of gate-ON time and the total treatment time. RESULTS: EF occurred in 18.4\% of total measurements. EF varied depending on the patient, fiducial sites, and treatment session. The mean incidence of EF for each patient varied from 2.9\% to 37.5\% (18.4+/-9.9). The EF magnitude was 0.2-12.2 mm in the left-right direction, 0.7-12.7 mm in the cranio-caudal direction, and 0.4-9.7 mm in the anterior-posterior direction. Total fiducial movement was 0.5-28.7 mm. GE was 36.1-69.2\% (55.4+/-11.0). EF magnitude correlated with total fiducial movement. CONCLUSION: This study showed that EF is not a rare phenomenon and needs to be taken into consideration for individualized precise 4D radiotherapy",

abstract="All radiation therapy treatment planning relies on accurate dose calculation. Uncertainties in dosimetric prediction can significantly degrade an otherwise optimal plan. In this work, we introduce a robust optimization method which handles dosimetric errors and warrants for high-quality IMRT plans. Unlike other dose error estimations, we do not rely on the detailed knowledge about the sources of the uncertainty and use a generic error model based on random perturbation. This generality is sought in order to cope with a large variety of error sources. We demonstrate the method on a clinical case of lung cancer and show that our method provides plans that are more robust against dosimetric errors and are clinically acceptable. In fact, the robust plan exhibits a two-fold improved equivalent uniform dose compared to the non-robust but optimized plan. The achieved speedup will allow computationally extensive multi-criteria or beam-angle optimization approaches to warrant for dosimetrically relevant plans",

Motion uncertainties can significantly degrade an otherwise optimized treatment plan. We present a spatiotemporal optimization method, which takes into account all phases of breathing via the corresponding 4D-CTs and provides a 4D-optimal plan that can be delivered throughout all breathing phases. Monte Carlo dose calculations are employed to warrant for highest dosimetric accuracy, as pertinent to study motion effects in lung. We demonstrate the performance of this optimization method with clinical lung cancer cases and compare the outcomes to conventional gating techniques. We report significant improvements in target coverage and in healthy tissue sparing at a comparable computational expense. Furthermore, we show that the phase-adapted 4D-optimized plans are robust against irregular breathing, as opposed to gating. This technique has the potential to yield a higher delivery efficiency and a decisively shorter delivery time",

abstract="PURPOSE: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is known as a radioresistant tumor, and there are few reports on radiotherapy for primary RCC. We evaluated the efficacy of carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for patients with RCC. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Data for patients with RCC who received CIRT were analyzed. A median total dose of 72 GyE (gray equivalents) in 16 fractions was administered without any additional treatment. Clinical stage was determined based on TNM classification by the International Union Against Cancer (UICC). Local recurrence was defined as definite tumor regrowth after treatment. RESULTS: Data for 10 patients were included in the analyses, including 7 patients with Stage I and 3 patients with Stage IV (T4NxM0 or TxN2M0) disease. The median maximum diameter of the tumor was 43 mm (24-120 mm). The median follow-up for surviving patients was 57.5 months (9-111 months). The 5-year local control rate, progression-free survival rate, cause-specific survival rate, and overall survival rates were 100\%, 100\%, 100\%, and 74\%, respectively. Interestingly, treated tumors showed very slow shrinkage, and the tumor in 1 case has been shrinking for 9 years. One patient with muscular invasion (T4 tumor) developed Grade 4 skin toxicity, but no other toxicity greater than Grade 2 was observed. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the few reports on curative radiotherapy for primary RCC. The response of the tumor to treatment was uncommon. However despite inclusion of T4 and massive tumors, favorable local controllability has been shown. The results indicate the possibility of radical CIRT, as well as surgery, for RCC",

abstract="PURPOSE: To determine the planning target volume (PTV) margin for an adaptive radiotherapy procedure that uses five computed tomography (CT) scans to calculate an average prostate position and rectum shape. To evaluate alternative methods to determine an average rectum based on a single delineation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Repeat CT scans (8-13) of 19 patients were used. The contoured prostates of the first four scans were matched on the planning CT (pCT) prostate contours. With the resulting translations and rotations the average prostate position was determined. An average rectum was obtained by either averaging the coordinates of corresponding points on the rectal walls or by selecting the ``best'' rectum or transforming the pCT rectum. Dose distributions were calculated for various expanded average prostates. The remaining CT scans were used to determine the dose received by prostate and rectum during treatment. RESULTS: For the prostate of the pCT scan and a 10-mm margin, all patients received more than 95\% of the prescribed dose to 95\% of the prostate. For the average prostate, a margin of 7 mm was needed to obtain a similar result (average PTV reduction 30\%). The average rectum overestimated the mean dose to the rectum by 0.4 +/- 1.6 Gy, which was better than the pCT rectum (2.1 +/- 3.0 Gy) and the alternative average rectums (1.0 +/- 2.6 Gy and 1.4 +/- 3.2 Gy). CONCLUSIONS: Our adaptive procedure allows for reduction of the PTV margin to 7 mm without decreasing prostate coverage during treatment. For accurate estimation of the rectum dose, rectums need to be delineated and averaged over multiple scans",

abstract="PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the dosimetric consequences of 4 treatment delivery techniques for prostate cancer patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: During an 8-week course of radiotherapy, 10 patients underwent computed tomography (CT) scans 3 times per week (243 total) before daily treatment with a CT-linear accelerator. Treatment delivery was simulated by realigning a fixed-margin treatment plan on each CT scan and calculating doses. The alignment methods were those based on the following: skin marks, bony registration, ultrasonography (US), and in-room CT. For the last two methods, prostate was the alignment target. The dosimetric effects of these alignment methods on the prostate, seminal vesicles, rectum, and bladder were compared. The average daily minimum dose to 0.1 cm3 was used as the metric for target coverage. RESULTS: Skin and bone alignments provided acceptable prostate coverage for only 70\% of patients, US alignment for 90\%, and CT alignment for 100\%. CT-based alignment of the prostate provided seminal vesicle (SV) coverage of > or = 69 Gy for all patients; US and bone alignments provided SV coverage of > or = 60 Gy. This SV coverage may be acceptable for early-stage cancer (equivalent SV dose = 55.8 Gy at 1.8 Gy per fraction), but unacceptable for late-stage cancer (SV dose = 75.6 Gy). At 75.6 Gy, the acceptable rate for SV coverage was 40\% for skin and bone alignments, 70\% for US, and 80\% for CT. CONCLUSIONS: Direct target alignment methods (US and CT) provided better target coverage. CT-guided alignment provided the best and most consistent dosimetric coverage. A larger planning target volume margin is needed for SV coverage when the alignment target is the prostate",

First experimental studies in a Lucite phantom have been performed at the medical TRIUMF proton beamline for proton energies of 62 MeV and 110 MeV. The proton dose delivered to the phantom ranged from 16 Gy up to 317 Gy. The induced activity was analysed 20-40 min after the irradiation with a PET scanner. The obtained depth activity profiles were compared to our calculation based on a model using available isotope production cross-section data. Both the observed absolute count rates and the activity profiles were found to agree very well with this model. Effects such as proton range straggling, inelastic nuclear interactions and the energy spectrum of the emitted positrons were studied in detail and found to change the activities by 5-10\%. The lateral deposition of dose in the phantom could be very well localized by the induced activity. However, the spatial correlation between dose depth profiles and depth activity profiles was found to be poor, hence the extraction of isodose profiles from activity profiles seems to be very difficult",

An analytical approach for inverse treatment planning of this radiotherapy technique is described. The inverse problem for the delivery of arbitrary 2D dose profiles is first formulated and then solved analytically. In contrast to previously applied strategies for solving the inverse problem, it is shown that the most general solution for the fluence profiles consists of two independent solutions of different parity. A first analytical expression for both fluence profiles is derived. The mathematical derivation includes two different strategies, an elementary expansion of fluence and dose into polynomials and a more practical approach in terms of Fourier transforms.

abstract="The optimization of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for charged particle beams is a necessary prerequisite to evaluate the clinical potential of this treatment modality in comparison to IMRT with high energy photons. A theoretical study for IMRT with charged particle beams delivered by rotation therapy is presented. First, the inverse problem for two-dimensional rotation therapy with arbitrary depth dose curves is formulated. Then a numerical strategy is devised to calculate fluence profiles for the simplified case of arbitrary rotationally invariant dose distributions. This mathematical framework is applied to study various aspects of charged particle IMRT. A central topic of the investigation is the evaluation of dose delivery, based on distal edge tracking (DET) and intensity modulation. The potential of DET-IMRT with charged particle beams is studied in comparison to an optimal, conventional dose delivery technique, which employs the concept of a spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP). Moreover, a comparison to photon IMRT is provided for simple geometric dose patterns. The technique of DET-IMRT for the delivery of a homogeneous target dose is only feasible for targets up to a critical radius, depending on the individual shape of the employed Bragg peak. The irradiation of larger targets requires energy modulation in addition to the range modulation for DET. The accurate placement of the Bragg peak with respect to the target edge is found to be of potential importance. Comparing dose delivery via DET-IMRT with the optimal SOBP technique revealed a significant advantage of DET-IMRT, especially a saved integral dose in target-adjacent healthy tissues of up to 30\%, and a reduction of the penumbra at the target edge by almost 50\%. A saving in integral dose to healthy tissues by a factor of 2-3 was observed for DET-IMRT in comparison to IMRT with high energy photons",

abstract="A radiotherapy treatment plan optimisation algorithm has been applied to 48 prostate plans and the results compared with those of an experienced human planner. Twelve patients were used in the study, and 3-, 4-, 6- and 8-field plans (with standard coplanar beam angles for each plan type) were optimised by both the human planner and the optimisation algorithm. The human planner ?optimised? the plan by conventional forward planning techniques. The optimisation algorithm was based on fast simulated annealing using a cost-function designed to achieve a homogenous dose in the ?planning-target-volume? and to minimise the integral dose to the organs at risk. ?Importance factors? assigned to different regions of the patient provide a method for controlling the algorithm, and it was found that the same values gave good results for almost all plans. A study of the convergence of the algorithm is presented and optimal convergence parameters are determined. The plans were compared on the basis of both dose statistics and ?normal-tissue-complication-probability? (NTCP) and ?tumour-control-probability? (TCP). The results of the comparison study show that the optimisation algorithm yielded results that were at least as good as the human planner for all plan types, and on the whole slightly better. A study of the beam-weights chosen by the optimisation algorithm and the planner revealed differences that increased with the number of beams in the plan. The planner was found to make small perturbations about a conceived optimal beam-weight set. The optimisation algorithm showed much greater variation, in response to individual patient geometry, frequently deselecting certain beams altogether from the plan. The algorithm is shown to be a useful tool for radiotherapy treatment planning. For simple (e.g., three-field) plans it was found to consistently achieve slightly higher TCP and lower NTCP values. For more complicated (e.g., eight-field) plans the optimisation also achieved slightly better results with generally less numbers of beams, unfavourable beams being deselected from the plan. Probably the greatest benefit is the reduced time taken by the optimisation to compute optimised beam-weights. This time was always <=5 min; a factor of up to 20-times faster than the human planner",

abstract="BANG-gel dosimetry offers the potential for measuring the dose delivered by a radiotherapy treatment technique, in three dimensions, with high spatial resolution and good accuracy. The ability to measure comprehensively a 3D dose distribution is a major advantage of the gel dosimeter over conventional planar and point-based dosimeter devices, particularly when applied to the verification of complex dose distributions characteristic of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). In this paper an in-house manufactured BANG-gel dosimeter was applied to study the dose distributions of two irradiation experiments for which the distributions were known: (i) a dosimetrically simple parallel-opposed irradiation, and (ii) a more complex nine-field 'static tomotherapy' intensity-modulated irradiation delivered with the Nomos MIMiC. The uniform distribution in (i) allowed a study of the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging parameters to achieve an optimal trade-off between noise and image resolution (optimum image resolution for the Siemens 1.5T Vision system was determined to be approximately 0.8 mm2 with a slice thickness of 2 mm). The spatial uniformity of gel sensitivity to radiation was found to depend strongly on the presence of oxygen, which must be eliminated for the gel dosimeter to be of use. The gel dosimeter was found to agree well with predicted dose distributions and accurately measured the steep penumbral fall-off of dose, even after many days, proving its potential for the verification of IMRT distributions. In the nine-field IMRT delivery (ii) the predicted dose was computed by both an in-house 'component-delivery' dose algorithm and the Peacock planning-system dose algorithm. Good agreement was found between the two algorithms despite the latter's omission of the change in penumbral characteristics with aperture-size during delivery, lack of inhomogeneity correction and approximate modelling of leaf leakage. These effects were found to be small for the problem studied. The predicted distribution agreed well with the gel-measured distribution at medium and high doses (50-90\% isodose lines) although differences of up to 10\% were observed at lower doses (30\% isodose line). The gel dosimeter was found to have the potential to verify IMRT distributions but required considerable care to achieve accurate results. Attention was required to achieve uniformity of gel sensitivity (to prevent oxygen contamination), and in the calibration process",

Absorbed depth-dose curves and profiles measured with this new technique show good agreement with corresponding measurements using diodes. This was proven in a 60Co beam as well as an electron beam. The dosemeter gel is made of agarose and ferrous sulphate solution. The dose response is linear (r = 0.9996) in the investigated dose interval, 0-40 Gy. The sensitivity is a factor of about six higher compared to ordinary ferrous sulphate solution, known as 'Fricke'. This is a true 3D dose measurement technique which will have a number of applications in radiation therapy, since it is possible to mould the gel to arbitrary geometries, mix different radiation qualities and integrate the absorbed dose from different kinds of fields",

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical outcomes of patients with pathologically proven, peripherally located, Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer who had undergone stereotactic body radiotherapy using real-time tumor tracking radiotherapy during the developmental period. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 41 patients (25 with Stage T1 and 16 with Stage T2) were admitted to the study between February 2000 and June 2005. A 5-mm planning target volume margin was added to the clinical target volume determined with computed tomography at the end of the expiratory phase. The gating window ranged from +/-2 to 3 mm. The dose fractionation schedule was 40 or 48 Gy in four fractions within 1 week. The dose was prescribed at the center of the planning target volume, giving more than an 80\% dose at the planning target volume periphery. RESULTS: For 28 patients treated with 48 Gy in four fractions, the overall actuarial survival rate at 3 years was 82\% for those with Stage IA and 32\% for those with Stage IB. For patients treated with 40 Gy in four fractions within 1 week, the overall actuarial survival rate at 3 years was 50\% for those with Stage IA and 0\% for those with Stage IB. A significant difference was found in local control between those with Stage IB who received 40 Gy vs. 48 Gy (p = 0.0015) but not in those with Stage IA (p = 0.5811). No serious radiation morbidity was observed with either dose schedule. CONCLUSION: The results of our study have shown that 48 Gy in four fractions within 1 week is a safe and effective treatment for peripherally located, Stage IA non-small-cell lung cancer. A steep dose-response curve between 40 and 48 Gy using a daily dose of 12 Gy delivered within 1 week was identified for Stage IB non-small-cell lung cancer in stereotactic body radiotherapy using real-time tumor tracking radiotherapy",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Stereotactic irradiation (STI) has been actively performed using various methods to achieve better local control of Stage I nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in Japan. The authors retrospectively evaluated results from a Japanese multiinstitutional study. METHODS: Patients with Stage I NSCLC (n = 245; median age, 76 years; T1N0M0, n = 155; T2N0M0, n = 90) were treated with hypofractionated high-dose STI in 13 institutions. Stereotactic three-dimensional treatment was performed using noncoplanar dynamic arcs or multiple static ports. A total dose of 18-75 gray (Gy) at the isocenter was administered in 1-22 fractions. The median calculated biologic effective dose (BED) was 108 Gy (range, 57-180 Gy). RESULTS: During follow-up (median, 24 months; range, 7-78 months), pulmonary complications of National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria Grade > 2 were observed in only 6 patients (2.4\%). Local progression occurred in 33 patients (14.5\%), and the local recurrence rate was 8.1\% for BED > or = 100 Gy compared with 26.4\% for < 100 Gy (P < 0.05). The 3-year overall survival rate of medically operable patients was 88.4\% for BED > or = 100 Gy compared with 69.4\% for < 100 Gy (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Hypofractionated high-dose STI with BED < 150 Gy was feasible and beneficial for curative treatment of patients with Stage I NSCLC. For all treatment methods and schedules, local control and survival rates were better with BED > or = 100 Gy compared with < 100 Gy. Survival rates in selected patients (medically operable, BED > or = 100 Gy) were excellent, and were potentially comparable to those of surgery",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients (median age, 76 years) with prostate cancer underwent thin-slice computed tomography (CT) in the vicinity of the prostate before and after active anal contraction. Three-dimensional displacement of the pelvis and prostate was measured. RESULTS: Mean (+/-standard deviation, SD) overall displacement of the prostate due to anal contraction was 0.3+/-1.4 mm to the right, 9.3+/-7.8 mm to the anterior, and 5+/-4 mm to the cranial direction. Mean displacement of the pelvis was 0.5+/-1.8 mm to the right, 4.1+/-7.1 mm to the anterior, and 1+/-3 mm to the cranial direction. Mean displacement of the prostate relative to the pelvis was 0.1+/-1.1 mm to the left, 5.2+/-3.3 mm to the anterior, and 4+/-4 mm to the cranial direction. CONCLUSIONS: Voluntary anal contraction within an experimental setting induces large prostate and bone motion, mainly in the anterior and cranial directions. The frequency and magnitude of actual anal contractions during radiotherapy for prostate cancer need to be determined",

The results show that the lateral penumbra is almost independent of the beam modulation and the diameter of the collimator.

abstract="BACKGROUND: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of circumferential pulmonary-vein ablation for the treatment of chronic atrial fibrillation. METHODS: A total of 146 patients with a mean (+/-SD) age of 57+/-9 years who had chronic atrial fibrillation were randomly assigned to receive amiodarone and undergo two cardioversions during the first three months alone (the control group) or in combination with circumferential pulmonary-vein ablation. Cardiac rhythm was assessed with daily telephonic transmissions for one year. The left atrial diameter and the severity of symptoms were assessed at 12 months. RESULTS: Among the 77 patients assigned to undergo circumferential pulmonary-vein ablation, ablation was repeated because of recurrent atrial fibrillation in 26 percent of patients and atypical atrial flutter in 6 percent. An intention-to-treat analysis showed that 74 percent of patients in the ablation group and 58 percent of those in the control group were free of recurrent atrial fibrillation or flutter without antiarrhythmic-drug therapy at one year (P=0.05). Among the 69 patients in the control group, 53 (77 percent) crossed over to undergo circumferential pulmonary-vein ablation for recurrent atrial fibrillation by one year and only 3 (4 percent) were in sinus rhythm without antiarrhythmic-drug therapy or ablation. There were significant decreases in the left atrial diameter (12+/-11 percent, P<0.001) and the symptom severity score (59+/-21 percent, P<0.001) among patients who remained in sinus rhythm after circumferential pulmonary-vein ablation. Except for atypical atrial flutter, there were no complications attributable to circumferential pulmonary-vein ablation. CONCLUSIONS: Sinus rhythm can be maintained long term in the majority of patients with chronic atrial fibrillation by means of circumferential pulmonary-vein ablation independently of the effects of antiarrhythmic-drug therapy, cardioversion, or both. The maintenance of sinus rhythm is associated with a significant decrease in both the severity of symptoms and the left atrial diameter",

abstract="PURPOSE: To improve treatment planning in radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer by including Respiratory Correlated-Computed Tomography (RC-CT) information in tumour delineation and dose planning. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Dense displacement fields were computed using a combination of rigid and non-rigid registrations between RC-CT phases. These registrations have been performed independently between each phase of the respiratory cycle and a reference phase for 13 patients. A manual delineation in the reference frame was propagated to every other phase according to the deformation fields recovered from the inter-phase registrations. Resulting delineations were compared to two manual delineations drawn by two physicians at each phase. On the other hand, dose distributions computed for every phase were deformed towards the reference phase. These distributions were then added on the reference phase to estimate the total dose received by each voxel through the whole respiratory cycle. RESULTS: The overlap between the deformed and the manual delineations was not significantly different than the overlap between the delineations made by the two physicians for 11 out of 13 patients thus proving that the method accuracy is comparable to inter-observer variability. Calculation of the effective dose distributions showed that these were conserved after deformation. CONCLUSION: We developed a method to use RC-CT information into the radiation treatment planning, including semi-automatic segmentation of lung tumours on each phase of the respiratory cycle and a total received dose per voxel estimation",

abstract="PURPOSE: Respiratory monitoring systems are used to detect the respiratory phase of patients during the planning and administration of respiratory gated radiotherapy by using four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) or 4D positron-emission tomography/CT (4DPET/CT) and the linear accelerator (linac), respectively. Generally, identical respiratory monitoring systems are used for 4DCT, 4DPET/CT, and linac. However, different systems are sometimes used in combination because the accessibility of the respiratory monitoring systems may differ by manufacturer. The combined use of different respiratory monitoring systems in phase-based gating is of concern because the differences in the timing of tags (end-respiration signals algorithmically determined by the respiratory monitoring system), defined by the two systems, may result in phase differences, The purpose of this study is to estimate this difference and evaluate its effect on 4DCT data. METHODS: Ten patients (seven men and three women) with a median age of 75 yr (range: 57-84 yr) were treated by gated stereotactic body radiation therapy between April and December 2009. Two types of respiratory monitoring systems--RPM (Varian Medical Systems) and AZ-733V (Anzai MEDICAL)--were placed on the abdominal surface of the patients, and the respiratory signals were acquired by both systems. The relationship between the amplitude peak and the tag obtained by each respiratory system was analyzed for each patient. Further, the 4DCT images were reconstructed by using the signals obtained from both the RPM and the AZ-733V systems, and the tumor volumes and the tumor centroid positions in the craniocaudal plane were analyzed for each patient. RESULTS: The correlation factor between the respiratory signals from the RPM system and AZ-733V system was 0.990 (range: 0.940-0.994). The amplitude peak of the RPM system corresponded well with that of the AZ-733V system. The median +/- standard deviation of the phase difference for all the patients ranged from -4.3 +/- 7.1\% to 3.5 +/- 2.2\%. In the case of some patients, differences were noted between the two systems in the estimation of the tumor centroid position and tumor shape. CONCLUSIONS: The estimation of the position of the tumor centroid and tumor shape may vary with the use of different respiratory monitoring systems. This implies that it is preferable to use the same respiratory monitoring system with 4DCT, 4DPET-CT, and linac",

abstract="To investigate how respiration influences the motion of lung and pancreas tumors and to relate the observations to treatment procedures intended to improve dose alignment by predicting the moving tumor?s position from external breathing indicators. Breathing characteristics for five healthy subjects were observed by optically tracking the displacement of the chest and abdomen, and by measuring tidal air volume with a spirometer. Fluoroscopic imaging of five radiotherapy patients detected the motion of lung and pancreas tumors synchronously with external breathing indicators. The external and fluoroscopic data showed a wide range of behavior in the normal breathing pattern and its effects on the position of lung and pancreas tumors. This included transient phase shifts between two different external measures of breathing that diminished to zero over a period of minutes, modulated phase shifts between tumor and chest wall motion, and other complex phenomena. Respiratory compensation strategies that infer tumor position from external breathing signals, including methods of beam gating and dynamic beam tracking, require three-dimensional knowledge of the tumor?s motion trajectory as well as the ability to detect and adapt to transient and continuously changing characteristics of respiratory motion during treatment",

abstract="Studies of organs in the thorax and abdomen have shown that these organs can move as much as 40 mm due to respiratory motion. Without compensation for this motion during the course of external beam radiation therapy, the dose coverage to target may be compromised. On the other hand, if compensation of this motion is by expansion of the margin around the target, a significant volume of normal tissue may be unnecessarily irradiated. In hypofractionated regimens, the issue of respiratory compensation becomes an important factor and is critical in single-fraction extracranial radiosurgery applications. CyberKnife is an image-guided radiosurgery system that consists of a 6-MV LINAC mounted to a robotic arm coupled through a control loop to a digital diagnostic x-ray imaging system. The robotic arm can point the beam anywhere in space with 6 degrees of freedom, without being constrained to a conventional isocenter. The CyberKnife has been recently upgraded with a real-time respiratory tracking and compensation system called Synchrony. Using external markers in conjunction with diagnostic x-ray images, Synchrony helps guide the robotic arm to move the radiation beam in real time such that the beam always remains aligned with the target. With the aid of Synchrony, the tumor motion can be tracked in three-dimensional space, and the motion-induced dosimetric change to target can be minimized with a limited margin. The working principles, advantages, limitations, and our clinical experience with this new technology will be discussed",

abstract="PURPOSE: Clinical proton beam therapy has been based on the use of a generic relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 1.0 or 1.1, since the available evidence has been interpreted as indicating that the magnitude of RBE variation with treatment parameters is small relative to our abilities to determine RBEs. As substantial clinical experience and additional experimental determinations of RBE have accumulated and the number of proton radiation therapy centers is projected to increase, it is appropriate to reassess the rationale for the continued use of a generic RBE and for that RBE to be 1.0-1.1. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Results of experimental determinations of RBE of in vitro and in vivo systems are examined, and then several of the considerations critical to a decision to move from a generic to tissue-, dose/fraction-, and LET-specific RBE values are assessed. The impact of an error in the value assigned to RBE on normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) is discussed. The incidence of major morbidity in proton-treated patients at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) for malignant tumors of the skull base and of the prostate is reviewed. This is followed by an analysis of the magnitude of the experimental effort to exclude an error in RBE of >or=10\% using in vivo systems. RESULTS: The published RBE values, using colony formation as the measure of cell survival, from in vitro studies indicate a substantial spread between the diverse cell lines. The average value at mid SOBP (Spread Out Bragg Peak) over all dose levels is approximately 1.2, ranging from 0.9 to 2.1. The average RBE value at mid SOBP in vivo is approximately 1.1, ranging from 0.7 to 1.6. Overall, both in vitro and in vivo data indicate a statistically significant increase in RBE for lower doses per fraction, which is much smaller for in vivo systems. There is agreement that there is a measurable increase in RBE over the terminal few millimeters of the SOBP, which results in an extension of the bioeffective range of the beam in the range of 1-2 mm. There is no published report to indicate that the RBE of 1.1 is low. However, a substantial proportion of patients treated at approximately 2 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE)/fraction 5 or more years ago were treated by a combination of both proton and photon beams. Were the RBE to be erroneously underestimated by approximately 10\%, the increase in complication frequency would be quite serious were the complication incidence for the reference treatment >or=3\% and the slope of the dose response curves steep, e.g., a gamma(50) approximately 4. To exclude >or=1.2 as the correct RBE for a specific condition or tissue at the 95\% confidence limit would require relatively large and multiple assays. CONCLUSIONS: At present, there is too much uncertainty in the RBE value for any human tissue to propose RBE values specific for tissue, dose/fraction, proton energy, etc. The experimental in vivo and clinical data indicate that continued employment of a generic RBE value and for that value to be 1.1 is reasonable. However, there is a local ``hot region'' over the terminal few millimeters of the SOBP and an extension of the biologically effective range. This needs to be considered in treatment planning, particularly for single field plans or for an end of range in or close to a critical structure. There is a clear need for prospective assessments of normal tissue reactions in proton irradiated patients and determinations of RBE values for several late responding tissues in laboratory animal systems, especially as a function of dose/fraction in the range of 1-4 Gy",

abstract="PURPOSE: To calculate the dose in time-dependent geometry, the results of three-dimensional calculations are usually performed separately and combined. This approach becomes cumbersome when high temporal resolution is required, if the geometry is complex, or if interplay effects between different, independently moving systems are to be studied. The purpose of this project was the implementation of continuous (four-dimensional [4D]) Monte Carlo simulation to study the irradiation of tumors under respiratory motion. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In taking advantage of object-oriented programming, we implemented 4D Monte Carlo dose calculation. Local dose depositions in the patient are calculated while beam configuration and organ positions are changed continuously. Deformable image registration is used to describe the CT voxel displacement over time. RESULTS: The 4D Monte Carlo technique is applied to a lung cancer case planned for proton therapy. We show that the effect of motion on the dose distribution can be simulated effectively based on statistical motion parameterizations acting on the geometry or based on patient-specific 4D CT information. CONCLUSION: We present a novel method able to calculate dose with underlying time-dependent geometry. The technique allows 4D dose calculation in arbitrary time scales in a single simulation even for double-dynamic systems (e.g., time-dependent beam delivery under organ motion)",

abstract="When dosimetric effects in time-dependent geometries are studied, usually either the results of individual three-dimensional (3D) calculations are combined or probability-based approaches are applied. These methods may become cumbersome and time-consuming if high time resolution is required or if the geometry is complex. Furthermore, it is difficult to study double-dynamic systems, e.g., to investigate the influence of time-dependent beam delivery (i.e., magnetically moving beam spots in proton beam scanning) on the dose deposition in a moving target. We recently introduced the technique of 4D Monte Carlo dose calculation to model continuously changing geometries. In intensity modulated proton therapy, dose is delivered by individual pristine Bragg curves. Dose spots are positioned in the patient by varying magnetic field and beam energy. If the movement of these dose spots occurs during significant respiratory motion, interplay effects can take place. Because of the inhomogeneity of individual subfields, the consequences of motion can be more severe than in conventional proton therapy. We demonstrate how the technique of 4D Monte Carlo can be used to study interplay effects in proton beam scanning. Time-dependent beam delivery to a changing patient geometry is simulated in a single 4D dose calculation. Interplay effects between respiratory motion and beam scanning speed are demonstrated",

abstract="The goal of this work was to facilitate the clinical use of Monte Carlo proton dose calculation to support routine treatment planning and delivery. The Monte Carlo code Geant4 was used to simulate the treatment head setup, including a time-dependent simulation of modulator wheels (for broad beam modulation) and magnetic field settings (for beam scanning). Any patient-field-specific setup can be modeled according to the treatment control system of the facility. The code was benchmarked against phantom measurements. Using a simulation of the ionization chamber reading in the treatment head allows the Monte Carlo dose to be specified in absolute units (Gy per ionization chamber reading). Next, the capability of reading CT data information was implemented into the Monte Carlo code to model patient anatomy. To allow time-efficient dose calculation, the standard Geant4 tracking algorithm was modified. Finally, a software link of the Monte Carlo dose engine to the patient database and the commercial planning system was established to allow data exchange, thus completing the implementation of the proton Monte Carlo dose calculation engine ('DoC++'). Monte Carlo re-calculated plans are a valuable tool to revisit decisions in the planning process. Identification of clinically significant differences between Monte Carlo and pencil-beam-based dose calculations may also drive improvements of current pencil-beam methods. As an example, four patients (29 fields in total) with tumors in the head and neck regions were analyzed. Differences between the pencil-beam algorithm and Monte Carlo were identified in particular near the end of range, both due to dose degradation and overall differences in range prediction due to bony anatomy in the beam path. Further, the Monte Carlo reports dose-to-tissue as compared to dose-to-water by the planning system. Our implementation is tailored to a specific Monte Carlo code and the treatment planning system XiO (Computerized Medical Systems Inc.). However, this work describes the general challenges and considerations when implementing proton Monte Carlo dose calculation in a clinical environment. The presented solutions can be easily adopted for other planning systems or other Monte Carlo codes",

There is agreement that there is a measurable increase in RBE over the terminal few millimeters of the SOBP, which results in an extension of the bioeffective range of the beam in the range of 1-2 mm. There is no published report to indicate that the RBE of 1.1 is low. However, a substantial proportion of patients treated at [approximate]2 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE)/fraction 5 or more years ago were treated by a combination of both proton and photon beams. Were the RBE to be erroneously underestimated by [approximate]10\%, the increase in complication frequency would be quite serious were the complication incidence for the reference treatment >=3\% and the slope of the dose response curves steep, e.g., a [gamma]50 [approximate] 4. To exclude >=1.2 as the correct RBE for a specific condition or tissue at the 95\% confidence limit would require relatively large and multiple assays. At present, there is too much uncertainty in the RBE value for any human tissue to propose RBE values specific for tissue, dose/fraction, proton energy, etc. The experimental in vivo and clinical data indicate that continued employment of a generic RBE value and for that value to be 1.1 is reasonable. However, there is a local ``hot region'' over the terminal few millimeters of the SOBP and an extension of the biologically effective range. This needs to be considered in treatment planning, particularly for single field plans or for an end of range in or close to a critical structure. There is a clear need for prospective assessments of normal tissue reactions in proton irradiated patients and determinations of RBE values for several late responding tissues in laboratory animal systems, especially as a function of dose/fraction in the range of 1-4 Gy",

abstract="Purpose To calculate the dose in time-dependent geometry, the results of three-dimensional calculations are usually performed separately and combined. This approach becomes cumbersome when high temporal resolution is required, if the geometry is complex, or if interplay effects between different, independently moving systems are to be studied. The purpose of this project was the implementation of continuous (four-dimensional [4D]) Monte Carlo simulation to study the irradiation of tumors under respiratory motion.Methods and materials In taking advantage of object-oriented programming, we implemented 4D Monte Carlo dose calculation. Local dose depositions in the patient are calculated while beam configuration and organ positions are changed continuously. Deformable image registration is used to describe the CT voxel displacement over time.Results The 4D Monte Carlo technique is applied to a lung cancer case planned for proton therapy. We show that the effect of motion on the dose distribution can be simulated effectively based on statistical motion parameterizations acting on the geometry or based on patient-specific 4D CT information.Conclusion We present a novel method able to calculate dose with underlying time-dependent geometry. The technique allows 4D dose calculation in arbitrary time scales in a single simulation even for double-dynamic systems (e.g., time-dependent beam delivery under organ motion)",

abstract="PURPOSE: To study the impact of selecting different data sets from four-dimensional computed tomography (4D CT) imaging during proton treatment planning in patients with distal esophageal cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We examined the effects of changes in 4D CT data set and smearing margins in proton treatment planning for 5 patients with distal esophageal cancer whose diaphragms were in the beam path and could move several centimeters during respiration. Planning strategies based on (1) average, (2) inspiration, and (3) expiration CT were evaluated in terms of their coverage on the internal clinic target volume (ICTV) at the prescribed dose. RESULTS: For Strategy 1, increasing the smearing margin caused an increase in the ICTV prescription dose coverage (PDC) at the end-exhalation phase for all patients, whereas the ICTV PDC decreased for some patients at the end-inhalation phase. For Strategy 2, a smearing margin in the range of 1.0 to 3.5 cm caused the ICTV PDC to remain essentially unchanged, regardless of which phase of 4D CT was used for dose calculation, for all patients. For Strategy 3, the ICTV coverage was adequate for 2 of the 5 patients when a smearing margin of less than 1.0 cm was used, but was not adequate for the other 3 patients regardless of the smearing margin. CONCLUSION: Using the inspiration CT plus a smearing margin can lead to adequate ICTV coverage in treatment plans for patients with distal esophageal tumors surrounded by tissue that is subject to large changes in density during a proton treatment",

abstract="The accurate repair of chromosomal double-strand breaks (DSBs) arising from exposure to exogenous agents, such as ionizing radiation (IR) and radiomimetic drugs is crucial in maintaining genomic integrity, cellular viability and the prevention of tumorigenesis. Eukaryotic cells have evolved efficient mechanisms that sense and respond to DSBs. The DNA DSB response is facilitated by hierarchical signaling networks that orchestrate chromatin structural changes, cell-cycle checkpoints and multiple enzymatic activities to repair the broken DNA ends. Sensors and transducers signal to numerous downstream cellular effectors which function primarily by substrate posttranslational modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation and ubiquitylation. In particular, the past several years have provided important insight into the role of chromatin remodeling and histones-specific modifications to control DNA damage detection, signaling and repair. This review summarizes recently identified factors that influence this complex process and the repair of DNA DSBs in eukaryotic cells",

abstract="Modern cardiac electrophysiology procedures include catheter-based arrhythmia ablation and transvenous device implantation, which are highly dependent on accurate, real-time cardiac imaging. With the realization that anatomic structures are critical to successful electrophysiologic procedures, accurately defining a patient's cardiac anatomy has become more important. Fluoroscopy allows for 2D imaging of cardiac structures in real-time, and is used to guide catheter and lead placement, but does not allow for visualization of soft tissues. Intracardiac echocardiography allows for both direct visualization of anatomic structures within the heart and real-time imaging during catheter placement. Despite advances in intracardiac echocardiography catheters that allow for larger windows, the ability to accurately delineate anatomic structures depends on the patient's anatomy and operator experience. Neither of these techniques allows for electrical mapping of the heart; however, both anatomic and electrical intracardiac mapping can be achieved with advanced mapping systems. These systems allow for real-time catheter localization, help elucidate cardiac anatomy, evaluate electrical activation during arrhythmias and guide catheter placement for deliverance of radiofrequency current. More recently, 3D cardiac computed tomography has been used to accurately define intracardiac anatomy; however, catheter tracking and electrical mapping cannot be performed by computed tomography. Mapping systems are now being merged with computed tomography images to produce an accurate anatomic and electrical map of the heart to guide catheter ablations. The objective of this paper is to describe the current imaging and mapping techniques used in electrophysiologic procedures",

The solution of the problem of appropriate intensity redistribution over different phases of body motion is achievable in dynamic multileaf collimator (DMLC) intensity modulated radiation therapy delivery, due to the fact that multiple solutions are admissible for imposing the same intensity map over a moving target in this technique of irradiation. The realization of this type of delivery provides a treatment methodology that delivers treatment plans for moving patient anatomy that are superior to any treatments possible for static patient body anatomy. This paper is devoted to exploring this idea. To this end, a simple, though clinically realistic example is developed and presented that shows modified DMLC leaf motions that deliver a predetermined intensity to a moving target while reducing the dose delivered to organs at risk",

abstract="BACKGROUND: The pulmonary veins (PVs) and surrounding ostial areas frequently house focal triggers or reentrant circuits critical to the genesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). We developed an anatomic approach aimed at isolating each PV from the left atrium (LA) by circumferential radiofrequency (RF) lesions around their ostia. METHODS AND RESULTS: We selected 26 patients with resistant AF, either paroxysmal (n=14) or permanent (n=12). A nonfluoroscopic mapping system was used to generate 3D electroanatomic LA maps and deliver RF energy. Two maps were acquired during coronary sinus and right atrial pacing to validate the lateral and septal PV lesions, respectively. Patients were followed up closely for >/=6 months. Procedures lasted 290+/-58 minutes, including 80+/-22 minutes for acquisition of all maps, and 118+/-16 RF pulses were deployed. Among 14 patients in AF at the beginning of the procedure, 64\% had sinus rhythm restoration during ablation. PV isolation was demonstrated in 76\% of 104 PVs treated by low peak-to-peak electrogram amplitude (0. 08+/-0.02 mV) inside the circular line and by disparity in activation times (58+/-11 ms) across the lesion. After 9+/-3 months, 22 patients (85\%) were AF-free, including 62\% not taking and 23\% taking antiarrhythmic drugs, with no difference (P:=NS) between paroxysmal and permanent AF. No thromboembolic events or PV stenoses were observed by transesophageal echocardiography. CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency PV isolation with electroanatomic guidance is safe and effective in either paroxysmal or permanent AF",

abstract="Quasidiscrete scanning is a delivery strategy for proton and ion beam therapy in which the beam is turned off when a slice is finished and a new energy must be set but not during the scanning between consecutive spots. Different scanning paths lead to different dose distributions due to the contribution of the unintended transit dose between spots. In this work an algorithm to optimize the scanning path for quasidiscrete scanned beams is presented. The classical simulated annealing algorithm is used. It is a heuristic algorithm frequently used in combinatorial optimization problems, which allows us to obtain nearly optimal solutions in acceptable running times. A study focused on the best choice of operational parameters on which the algorithm performance depends is presented. The convergence properties of the algorithm have been further improved by using the next-neighbor algorithm to generate the starting paths. Scanning paths for two clinical treatments have been optimized. The optimized paths are found to be shorter than the back-and-forth, top-to-bottom (zigzag) paths generally provided by the treatment planning systems. The gamma method has been applied to quantify the improvement achieved on the dose distribution. Results show a reduction of the transit dose when the optimized paths are used. The benefit is clear especially when the fluence per spot is low, as in the case of repainting. The minimization of the transit dose can potentially allow the use of higher beam intensities, thus decreasing the treatment time. The algorithm implemented for this work can optimize efficiently the scanning path of quasidiscrete scanned particle beams. Optimized scanning paths decrease the transit dose and lead to better dose distributions",

abstract="PURPOSE: Understanding motion characteristics of liver such as, interfractional and intrafractional motion variability, difference in motion within different locations in the organ, and their complex relationship with the breathing cycles are particularly important for image-guided liver SBRT. The purpose of this study was to investigate such motion characteristics based on fiducial markers tracked with the x-ray projections of the CBCT scans, taken immediately prior to the treatments. METHODS: Twenty liver SBRT patients were analyzed. Each patient had three fiducial markers (2 x 5-mm gold) percutaneously implanted around the gross tumor. The prescription ranged from 2 to 8 fractions per patient. The CBCT projections data for each fraction ( approximately 650 projectionsscan), for each patient, were analyzed and the 2D positions of the markers were extracted using an in-house algorithm. In total, >55 000 x-ray projections were analyzed from 85 CBCT scans. From the 2D extracted positions, a 3D motion trajectory of the markers was constructed, from each CBCT scans, resulting in left-right (LR), anterior-posterior (AP), and cranio-caudal (CC) location information of the markers with >55 000 data points. The authors then analyzed the interfraction and intrafraction liver motion variability, within different locations in the organ, and as a function of the breathing cycle. The authors also compared the motion characteristics against the planning 4DCT and the RPM (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) breathing traces. Variations in the appropriate gating window (defined as the percent of the maximum range at which 50\% of the marker positions are contained), between fractions were calculated as well. RESULTS: The range of motion for the 20 patients were 3.0 +/- 2.0 mm, 5.1 +/- 3.1 mm, and 17.9 +/- 5.1 mm in the planning 4DCT, and 2.8 +/- 1.6 mm, 5.3 +/- 3.1 mm, and 16.5 +/- 5.7 mm in the treatment CBCT, for LR, AP, and CC directions, respectively. The range of respiratory period was 3.9 +/- 0.7 and 4.2 +/- 0.8 s during the 4DCT simulation and the CBCT scans, respectively. The authors found that breathing-induced AP and CC motions are highly correlated. That is, all markers moved cranially also moved posteriorly and vice versa, irrespective of the location. The LR motion had a more variable relationship with the APCC motions, and appeared random with respect to the location. That is, when the markers moved toward cranial-posterior direction, 58\% of the markers moved to the patient-right, 22\% of the markers moved to the patient-left, and 20\% of the markers had minimalnone motion. The absolute difference in the motion magnitude between the markers, in different locations within the liver, had a positive correlation with the absolute distance between the markers (R(2) = 0.69, linear-fit). The interfractional gating window varied significantly for some patients, with the largest having 29.4\%-56.4\% range between fractions. CONCLUSIONS: This study analyzed the liver motion characteristics of 20 patients undergoing SBRT. A large variation in motion was observed, interfractionally and intrafractionally, and that as the distance between the markers increased, the difference in the absolute range of motion also increased. This suggests that marker(s) in closest proximity to the target be used",

abstract="PURPOSE: To report a method for explicitly designing a planning target volume (PTV) for treatment planning and evaluation in heterogeneous media for passively scattered proton therapy and scanning beam proton therapy using single-field optimization (SFO). METHODS AND MATERIALS: A beam-specific PTV (bsPTV) for proton beams was derived by ray-tracing and shifting ray lines to account for tissue misalignment in the presence of setup error or organ motion. Range uncertainties resulting from inaccuracies in computed tomography-based range estimation were calculated for proximal and distal surfaces of the target in the beam direction. The bsPTV was then constructed based on local heterogeneity. The bsPTV thus can be used directly as a planning target as if it were in photon therapy. To test the robustness of the bsPTV, we generated a single-field proton plan in a virtual phantom. Intentional setup and range errors were introduced. Dose coverage to the clinical target volume (CTV) under various simulation conditions was compared between plans designed based on the bsPTV and a conventional PTV. RESULTS: The simulated treatment using the bsPTV design performed significantly better than the plan using the conventional PTV in maintaining dose coverage to the CTV. With conventional PTV plans, the minimum coverage to the CTV dropped from 99\% to 67\% in the presence of setup error, internal motion, and range uncertainty. However, plans using the bsPTV showed minimal drop of target coverage from 99\% to 94\%. CONCLUSIONS: The conventional geometry-based PTV concept used in photon therapy does not work well for proton therapy. We investigated and validated a beam-specific PTV method for designing and evaluating proton plans",

They were stopped in PMMA blocks placed in the centre of the field of view of the positron camera that is installed in the heavy ion tumour treatment facility at GSI. The \&beta;\$^\&plus;\$ activity signal was found to be three times larger than that produced by carbon ions at the same range and applied physical dose. The reconstructed spatial \&beta;\$^\&plus;\$ activity distributions were analysed and compared with the production of positron emitters predicted by a calculation based on experimental cross-sections and on the proton flux given by the FLUKA Monte Carlo code. The shape of the depth-activity profiles was well reproduced by the model and the correlation with the proton range and the depth-dose distributions was carefully investigated. Despite the non-trivial range determination from the \&beta;\$^\&plus;\$ activity distribution in the proton case, our experimental investigation supports the feasibility of an in situ proton therapy monitoring by means of in-beam PET, as already clinically implemented for the monitoring of carbon ion therapy at GSI Darmstadt",

abstract="Positron emission tomography (PET) is currently the only feasible method for in-situ and noninvasive three-dimensional monitoring of the precision of the treatment in highly conformal ion therapy. Its positive clinical impact has been proven for fractionated carbon ion therapy of head and neck (H\&N) tumors at the experimental facility at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI), Darmstadt, Germany. Following previous promising experiments, the possible extension of the method to the monitoring of proton therapy has been investigated further in extensive in-beam measurements at GSI. Millimeter accuracy for verification of the lateral field position and for the most challenging issue of range monitoring has been demonstrated in monoenergetic and spread-out Bragg-peak (SOBP) proton irradiation of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) targets. The irradiation of an inhomogeneous phantom with tissue equivalent inserts in combination with further dynamic analysis has supported the extension of such millimeter precision to real clinical cases, at least in regions of interest for low perfused tissues. All the experimental investigations have been reproduced by the developed modeling rather well. This indicates the possible extraction of valuable clinical information as particle range in-vivo, irradiation field position, and even local deviations from the dose prescription on the basis of the comparison between measured and predicted activity distributions. Hence, the clinical feasibility of in-beam PET for proton therapy monitoring is strongly supported.",

abstract="PURPOSE: The benefit of using dedicated in-beam positron emission tomography (PET) detectors in the treatment room instead of commercial tomographs nearby is an open question. This work quantitatively compares the measurable signal for in-beam and offline PET imaging, taking into account realistic acquisition strategies at different ion beam facilities. Both scenarios of pulsed and continuous irradiation from synchrotron and cyclotron accelerators are considered, because of their widespread use in most carbon ion and proton therapy centers. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A mathematical framework is introduced to compare the time-dependent amount and spatial distribution of decays from irradiation-induced isotope production. The latter is calculated with Monte Carlo techniques for real proton treatments of head-and-neck and paraspinal tumors. Extrapolation to carbon ion irradiation is based on results of previous phantom experiments. Biologic clearance is modeled taking into account available data from previous animal and clinical studies. RESULTS: Ratios between the amount of physical decays available for in-beam and offline detection range from 40\% to 60\% for cyclotron-based facilities, to 65\% to 110\% (carbon ions) and 94\% to 166\% (protons) at synchrotron-based facilities, and increase when including biologic clearance. Spatial distributions of decays during irradiation exhibit better correlation with the dose delivery and reduced influence of biologic processes. CONCLUSIONS: In-beam imaging can be advantageous for synchrotron-based facilities, provided that efficient PET systems enabling detection of isotope decays during beam extraction are implemented. For very short (<2 min) irradiation times at cyclotron-based facilities, a few minutes of acquisition time after the end of irradiation are needed for counting statistics, thus affecting patient throughput",

abstract="Purpose: To investigate the feasibility and value of positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) for treatment verification after proton radiotherapy. Methods and Materials: This study included 9 patients with tumors in the cranial base, spine, orbit, and eye. Total doses of 1.8-3 GyE and 10 GyE (for an ocular melanoma) per fraction were delivered in 1 or 2 fields. Imaging was performed with a commercial PET/CT scanner for 30 min, starting within 20 min after treatment. The same treatment immobilization device was used during imaging for all but 2 patients. Measured PET/CT images were coregistered to the planning CT and compared with the corresponding PET expectation, obtained from CT-based Monte Carlo calculations complemented by functional information. For the ocular case, treatment position was approximately replicated, and spatial correlation was deduced from reference clips visible in both the planning radiographs and imaging CT. Here, the expected PET image was obtained from an analytical model. Results: Good spatial correlation and quantitative agreement within 30\% were found between the measured and expected activity. For head-and-neck patients, the beam range could be verified with an accuracy of 1-2 mm in well-coregistered bony structures. Low spine and eye sites indicated the need for better fixation and coregistration methods. An analysis of activity decay revealed as tissue-effective half-lives of 800-1,150 s. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of postradiation PET/CT for in vivo treatment verification. It also indicates some technological and methodological improvements needed for optimal clinical application",

abstract="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To compare the rectal wall and bladder volume in the high dose region with or without the use of a balloon catheter with both three-dimensional (3D)-conformal and intensity modulated radiation therapy (CRT, IMRT) approaches in the treatment of prostate cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five patients with a wide range of prostate volumes and treated with primary external beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer were selected for analysis. Pinnacle treatment plans were generated utilizing a 3D conformal six-field design and an IMRT seven coplanar-field plan with a novel, three-step optimization and with ultrasound localization. Separate plans were devised with a rectal balloon deflated or air inflated with and without inclusion of the seminal vesicles (SV) in the target volume. The prescription dose was 76Gy in 38 fractions of 2Gy each. Cumulative dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were analyzed for the planning target volume (PTV), rectal wall, and bladder with an inflated (60cc air) or deflated balloon with and without SV included. The volumes of rectal wall and bladder above 60, 65, and 70Gy with each treatment approach were evaluated. RESULTS: Daily balloon placement was well-tolerated with good patient positional reproducibility. Inflation of the rectal balloon in all cases resulted in a significant decrease in the absolute volume of rectal wall receiving greater than 60, 65, or 70Gy. The rectal sparing ratio (RSR), consisting of a structure's high dose volume with the catheter inflated, divided by the volume with the catheter deflated, was calculated for each patient with and without seminal vesicle inclusion for 3D-CRT and IMRT. For 3D-CRT, RSRs with SV included were 0.59, 0.59, and 0.56 and with SV excluded were 0.60, 0.58, and 0.54 at doses of greater than 60, 65, and 70Gy, respectively. Similarly, for IMRT, the mean RSRs were 0.59, 0.59, and 0.63 including SV and 0.71, 0.66, and 0.67 excluding SV at these same dose levels, respectively. Averaged over all conditions, inflation of the rectal balloon resulted in a significant reduction in rectal volume receiving > or =65Gy to a mean ratio of 0.61 (P=0.01) or, in other words, a mean fractional high dose rectal sparing of 39\%. There was a slight overall increase to 1.13 in the relative volume of bladder receiving at least 65Gy; however, this was not significant (P=0.6). Use of an endorectal balloon with a non-image-guided 3D-CRT plan produced about as much rectal dose sparing as a highly conformal, image-guided IMRT approach without a balloon. However, inclusion of a balloon with IMRT produced further rectal sparing still. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that use of a rectal balloon with a 3D-CRT plan incorporating typical treatment margins will produce significant high dose rectal sparing that is comparable to that achieved by a highly conformal IMRT with ultrasound localization. Further sparing is achieved with the inclusion of a balloon catheter in an IMRT plan. Thus, in addition to a previously reported advantage of prostate immobilization, the use of a rectal displacement balloon during daily treatment results in high dose rectal wall sparing during both modestly and highly conformal radiotherapy. Such sparing could assist in controlling and limiting rectal toxicity during increasingly aggressive dose escalation",

abstract="The quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) was used to study the variability of acoustic properties of living cells on the sub-second time scale. A confluent cell layer of rat cardiac myocytes was grown onto the electrode of quartz crystal resonator. The cell layer performed periodic, synchronous contractions at a rate of about 1.5 Hz. In order to monitor these rather fast changes in the state of the cells, the QCM was operated in a ``fast mode'', which allows sampling of the shift of the resonance frequency and energy dissipation with a rate of up to 100 Hz. The contractions were clearly reflected in periodic variations of the resonance frequency and the bandwidth. The rate of the contractions, in particular, could be easily detected in this way. Building on the rate of contraction, the setup can be used to monitor the response of the cell layer to heart stimulating drugs like isoproterenol. Depending on the concentration of isoproterenol, the beat rate was found to increase by up to a factor of two",

abstract="Following advances in conformal radiotherapy, a key problem now facing radiation oncologists is target definition. While MRI and CT provide images of excellent spatial resolution, they do not always provide sufficient contrast to identify tumour extent or to identify regions of high cellular activity that might be targeted with boost doses. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is an alternative approach that holds great promise for aiding target definition for radiotherapy treatment planning, and for evaluation of response and recurrence. MRS is able to detect signals from low molecular weight metabolites such as choline and creatine that are present at concentrations of a few mM in tissue. Spectra may be acquired from single voxels, or from a 2D or 3D array of voxels using spectroscopic imaging. The current state of the art achieves a spatial resolution of 6-10 mm in a scan time of about 10-15 min. Co-registered MR images are acquired in the same examination. The method is currently under evaluation, in particular in brain (where MRS has been shown to differentiate between many tumour types and grades) and in prostate (where cancer may be distinguished from normal tissue and benign prostatic hypertrophy). The contrast achieved with MRS, based on tissue biochemistry, therefore provides a promising alternative for identifying tumour extent and regions of high metabolic activity. It is anticipated that MRS will become an essential tool for treatment planning where other modalities lack the necessary contrast",

abstract="PURPOSE: To identify dosimetric variables predictive of acute gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity and to determine whether hormonal therapy (HT) is independently associated with acute GI and GU toxicity in prostate cancer patients treated with conformal radiotherapy (RT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: This analysis was performed on 336 patients participating in a multicenter (four hospitals) randomized trial comparing 68 Gy and 78 Gy. The clinical target volume consisted of the prostate with or without the seminal vesicles, depending on the risk of seminal vesicle involvement. The margin from the clinical target volume to the planning target volume was 1 cm. For these patients, the treatment plan for a total dose of 68 Gy was used, because nearly all toxicity appeared before the onset of the 10-Gy boost. Acute toxicity (<120 days) was scored according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. The dosimetric parameters were obtained from the relative and absolute dose-volume/surface histograms derived from the rectal wall (rectal wall volume receiving > or =5-65 Gy) and the bladder surface (bladder surface receiving > or =5-65 Gy). Additionally, relative and absolute dose-length histograms of the rectum were created, and the lengths of rectum receiving more than a certain dose over the whole circumference (rectal length receiving > or =5-65 Gy) were computed. The clinical variables taken into account for GI toxicity were neoadjuvant HT, hospital, and dose-volume group; for GU toxicity, the variables pretreatment GU symptoms, neoadjuvant HT, and transurethral resection of the prostate were analyzed. The variable neoadjuvant HT was divided into three categories: no HT, short-term neoadjuvant HT (started < or =3 months before RT), and long-term neoadjuvant HT (started >3 months before RT). RESULTS: Acute GI toxicity Grade 2 or worse was seen in 46\% of the patients. Patients with long-term neoadjuvant HT experienced less Grade 2 or worse toxicity (27\%) compared with those receiving short-term neoadjuvant HT (50\%) and no HT (50\%). The volumes of the prostate and seminal vesicles were significantly smaller in both groups receiving neoadjuvant HT compared with those receiving no HT. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, including the two statistically significant clinical variables neoadjuvant HT and hospital, a volume effect was found for the relative, as well as absolute, rectal wall volumes exposed to intermediate and high doses. Of all the length parameters, the relative rectal length irradiated to doses of > or =5 Gy and > or =30 Gy and absolute lengths receiving > or =5-15 and 30 Gy were significant. Acute GU toxicity Grade 2 or worse was reported in 56\% of cases. For patients with pretreatment GU symptoms, the rate was 93\%. The use of short-term and long-term neoadjuvant HT resulted in more GU toxicity (73\% and 71\%) compared with no HT (50\%). In multivariate analysis, containing the variables pretreatment symptoms and neoadjuvant HT, only the absolute dose-surface histogram parameters (absolute surface irradiated to > or =40, 45, and 65 Gy) were significantly associated with acute GU toxicity. CONCLUSION: A volume effect was found for acute GI toxicity for relative, as well as absolute, volumes. With regard to acute GU toxicity, an area effect was found, but only for absolute dose-surface histogram parameters. Neoadjuvant HT appeared to be an independent prognostic factor for acute toxicity, resulting in less acute GI toxicity, but more acute GU toxicity. The presence of pretreatment GU symptoms was the most important prognostic factor for GU symptoms during RT",

abstract="PURPOSE: To compare acute and late gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) side effects in prostate cancer patients randomized to receive 68 Gy or 78 Gy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1997 and February 2003, 669 prostate cancer patients were randomized between radiotherapy with a dose of 68 Gy and 78 Gy, in 2 Gy per fraction and using three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. All T stages with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <60 ng/mL were included, except any T1a and well-differentiated T1b-c tumors with PSA < or =4 ng/mL. Stratification was done for four dose-volume groups (according to the risk of seminal vesicles [SV] involvement), age, hormonal treatment (HT), and hospital. The clinical target volume (CTV) consisted of the prostate with or without the SV, depending on the estimated risk of SV invasion. The CTV-planning target volume (PTV) margin was 1 cm for the first 68 Gy and was reduced to 0.5 cm (0 cm toward the rectum) for the last 10 Gy in the 78 Gy arm. Four Dutch hospitals participated in this Phase III trial. Evaluation of acute and late toxicity was based on 658 and 643 patients, respectively. For acute toxicity (<120 days), the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) scoring system was used and the maximum score was reported. Late toxicity (>120 days) was scored according to the slightly adapted RTOG/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 31 months. For acute toxicity no significant differences were seen between the two randomization arms. GI toxicity Grade 2 and 3 was reported as the maximum acute toxicity in 44\% and 5\% of the patients, respectively. For acute GU toxicity, these figures were 41\% and 13\%. No significant differences between both randomization arms were seen for late GI and GU toxicity, except for rectal bleeding requiring laser treatment or transfusion (p = 0.007) and nocturia (p = 0.05). The 3-year cumulative risk of late RTOG/EORTC GI toxicity grade > or =2 was 23.2\% for 68 Gy, and 26.5\% for 78 Gy (p = 0.3). The 3-year risks of late RTOG/EORTC GU toxicity grade > or =2 were 28.5\% and 30.2\% for 68 Gy and 78 Gy, respectively (p = 0.3). Factors related to acute GI toxicity were HT (p < 0.001), a higher dose-volume group (p = 0.01), and pretreatment GI symptoms (p = 0.04). For acute GU toxicity, prognostic factors were: pretreatment GU symptoms (p < 0.001), HT (p = 0.003), and prior transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) (p = 0.02). A history of abdominal surgery (p < 0.001) and pretreatment GI symptoms (p = 0.001) were associated with a higher incidence of late GI grade > or =2 toxicity, whereas HT (p < 0.001), pretreatment GU symptoms (p < 0.001), and prior TURP (p = 0.006) were prognostic factors for late GU grade > or =2. CONCLUSIONS: Raising the dose to the prostate from 68 Gy to 78 Gy resulted in higher incidences of acute and late GI and GU toxicity, but these differences were not significant, except for late rectal bleeding requiring treatment and late nocturia. Other factors than the studied dose levels appeared to be important in predicting toxicity after radiotherapy, especially previous surgical interventions (abdominal surgery or TURP), hormonal therapy, and the presence of pretreatment symptoms",

abstract="PURPOSE: To analyze whether inclusion of predisposing clinical features in the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model improves the estimation of late gastrointestinal toxicity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study includes 468 prostate cancer patients participating in a randomized trial comparing 68 with 78 Gy. We fitted the probability of developing late toxicity within 3 years (rectal bleeding, high stool frequency, and fecal incontinence) with the original, and a modified LKB model, in which a clinical feature (e.g., history of abdominal surgery) was taken into account by fitting subset specific TD50s. The ratio of these TD50s is the dose-modifying factor for that clinical feature. Dose distributions of anorectal (bleeding and frequency) and anal wall (fecal incontinence) were used. RESULTS: The modified LKB model gave significantly better fits than the original LKB model. Patients with a history of abdominal surgery had a lower tolerance to radiation than did patients without previous surgery, with a dose-modifying factor of 1.1 for bleeding and of 2.5 for fecal incontinence. The dose-response curve for bleeding was approximately two times steeper than that for frequency and three times steeper than that for fecal incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion of predisposing clinical features significantly improved the estimation of the NTCP. For patients with a history of abdominal surgery, more severe dose constraints should therefore be used during treatment plan optimization",

abstract="PURPOSE: To determine whether a dose of 78 Gy improves outcome compared with a conventional dose of 68 Gy for prostate cancer patients treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1997 and February 2003, stage T1b-4 prostate cancer patients were enrolled onto a multicenter randomized trial comparing 68 Gy with 78 Gy. Patients were stratified by institution, age, (neo)adjuvant hormonal therapy (HT), and treatment group. Four treatment groups (with specific radiation volumes) were defined based on the probability of seminal vesicle involvement. The primary end point was freedom from failure (FFF). Failure was defined as clinical failure or biochemical failure, according to the American Society of Therapeutic Radiation Oncology definition. Other end points were freedom from clinical failure (FFCF), overall survival (OS), and toxicity. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 51 months. Of the 669 enrolled patients, 664 were included in the analysis. HT was prescribed for 143 patients. FFF was significantly better in the 78-Gy arm compared with the 68-Gy arm (5-year FFF rate, 64\% v 54\%, respectively), with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.74 (P = .02). No significant differences in FFCF or OS were seen between the treatment arms. There was no difference in late genitourinary toxicity of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer grade 2 or more and a slightly higher nonsignificant incidence of late gastrointestinal toxicity of grade 2 or more. CONCLUSION: This multicenter randomized trial shows a significantly improved FFF in prostate cancer patients treated with a higher dose of radiotherapy",

abstract="Deformable registration is an important application in medical image analysis and processing. We propose a physics-based parametric approach for deformable image registration, where non-rigid transformations are computed using an irregular grid of control points distributed within the image domain. The image is modelled as a three-dimensional (3D) homogeneous infinite elastic medium. It is assumed that a Gaussian-shaped force is applied at every control point, where the strengths, directions and influence areas of the forces as well as the positions of the control points are considered as free parameters whose optimization leads to maximization of the similarity measure between the images to be registered. For optimization, a computationally efficient Levenberg\&ndash;Marquardt method is used. The proposed approach has certain advantages over traditional landmark-based methods or the registration methods based on regular grids, for example B-splines, since comparable results can be achieved by using less control points. Experimental results with 3D clinical images demonstrate that our method is capable of successfully coping with complex registration tasks",

This paper reports the quality assurance (QA) developments in its clinical implementation for prostate cancer patients. A series of pre-clinical validation tests were carried out to verify the overall accuracy and consistency of the online replanning procedure. These tests include (a) phantom measurements of 22 individual patient adaptive plans to verify their accuracy and deliverability and (b) efficiency and applicability of the online replanning process. A four-step QA procedure was established to ensure the safe and accurate delivery of an adaptive plan, including (1) offline phantom measurement of the original plan, (2) online independent monitor unit (MU) calculation for a redundancy check, (3) online verification of plan-data transfer using an in-house software and (4) offline validation of actually delivered beam parameters. The pre-clinical validations demonstrate that the newly implemented online replanning technique is dosimetrically accurate and practically efficient. The four-step QA procedure is capable of identifying possible errors in the process of online adaptive radiotherapy and to ensure the safe and accurate delivery of the adaptive plans. Based on the success of this work, the online replanning technique has been used in the clinic to correct for interfractional changes during the prostate radiation therapy",

abstract="PURPOSE: To quantitatively characterize the interfraction variations and their dosimetric effects in radiotherapy for prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 486 daily computed tomography (CT) sets acquired for 20 prostate cancer patients treated with daily CT-guided repositioning using a linear accelerator and CT-on-rail combination were analyzed. The prostate, rectum, and bladder, delineated on each daily CT data set, were compared with those from the planning CT scan. Several quantities, including Dice's coefficient and the maximal overlapping rate, were used to characterize the interfraction variations. The delivered dose was reconstructed by applying the original plan to the daily CT scan with consideration of proper repositioning. RESULTS: The mean prostate Dice's coefficient and maximal overlapping rate after bony registration was 69.7\%+/-13.8\% (standard deviation) and 85.6\%+/-7.8\% (standard deviation), respectively. The daily delivered dose distributions were generally inferior to the planned dose distribution for target coverage and/or normal structure sparing. For example, for approximately 5\% of the treatment fractions, the prostate volume receiving 100\% of the prescription dose decreased dramatically (15-20\%) compared with its planned value. The magnitudes of the interfraction variations and their dosimetric effects indicated that, statistically, current standard repositioning using prostate alignment might be adequate for two-thirds of the fractions, but for the rest of the fractions, better on-line correction strategies, such as on-line replanning, are needed. CONCLUSION: Different adaptive correction schemes for prostatic interfraction changes can be used according to the anatomic changes, as quantified by the organ displacement and deformation parameters. On-line replanning is needed for approximately one-third of the treatment fractions",

abstract="Purpose:A prototype breathing phantom (named LuCa) has been developed which simulates the anatomy and motion of a patient thorax.In this work, we describe the results of the first commissioning tests with LuCa. Methods:The phantom provides a close representation of the human thorax. The lungs,contained within a tissue-equivalent ribcage and skin,are made from a polymer foam,which is inflated and deflated using a custommade ventilator. A tumor is simulated using a wooden ball with cutplanes for placing GafChromic films. The ventilator,controlled with Labview software,simulates a full range of breathing motion types.Commissioning tests were performed to assess its performance using imaging (CT and radiographic) and film dosimetry as follows:i)maximum Tumor excursion at acceptable pressure ranges, ii)tumor Motion repeatability between breathing periods,iii)reproducibility between measurement days,iv)tumor-to-surface motion correlation and v)reproducibility of film positioning in phantom. Results:The phantom can generate repeatable motion patterns with sin4,sin,breath-hold (tumor amplitude repeatability <0.5mm over 10min),aswell as patient-specific motion types. Maximum excursions of the tumor are 20mm and 14mm for the large and small tumor inserts respectively. Amplitude reproducibility (Coefficient of Variation) averaged at 16\% for the workable pressure range over 2 months. Good correlation between tumor and surface motion was found with R2=0.92. Reproducibility of film positioning within the thorax was within 0.9mm, and maximum 3? error from the coronal plane. Film measurements revealed that the film repositioning error yields relative errors in the mean dose over the planned target volume (PTV) of up to 2.5\% and 4.5\% for films at the center and on the edge of the PTV respectively. Conclusion: Commissioning tests have shown that the LuCa phantom can produce tumor motion with excellent repeatability. However,a poorer performance in reproducibility of tumor amplitude for a given peak pressure week-to-week. Film set-up reproducibility is adequate for detection of dosimetric errors resulting from motion of >3\%. This work is funded by Swiss National Fund Grants 320030\_127569 and 320030\_1493942-1",

abstract="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) is used for breathing-adapted radiotherapy planning. Irregular breathing, large tumour motion or interpolation of images can cause artefacts in the 4DCT. This study evaluates the impact of artefacts on gross tumour volume (GTV) size. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 19 4DCT scans of patients with peripheral lung tumours, GTV was delineated in all bins. Variations in GTV size between bins in each 4DCT scan were analysed and correlated to tumour motion and variations in breathing signal amplitude and breathing signal period. End-expiration GTV size (GTVexp) was considered as reference for GTV size. Intra-session delineation error was estimated by re-delineation of GTV in eight of the 4DCT scans. RESULTS: In 16 of the 4DCT scans the maximum deviations from GTVexp were larger than could be explained by delineation error. The deviations were largest in the bins adjacent to the end-inspiration bin. The coefficient of variation of GTV size was significantly correlated to tumour motion in the cranio-caudal direction, but no significant correlation was found to breathing signal variations. CONCLUSION: We found considerable variations in GTV size throughout the 4DCT scans. Awareness of the error introduced by artefacts is important especially if radiotherapy planning is based on a single 4DCT bin",

abstract="The importance of the TNM staging system for patient management, clinical research and communicating information about lung cancer is of international importance. Modifications of the TNM classification system is scheduled for the near future. A retrospective review of 2376 patients with primary non-small cell lung cancer treated in a monocentric institution between 1996 and 2005 was performed. The overall 5-year survival rate was 46.8\%. A total of 2083 patients had complete resections with a 5-year survival of 50.7\%. After complete resection the 5-year survival rates by pathological stage of the disease were as follows: 68.5\% for IA, 66.6\% for IB, 55.3\% for IIA, 49.0\% for IIB, 35.8\% for IIIA, 35.4\% for IIIB, and not defined (3-year survival: 33.1\%) for IV. The difference in prognosis between stage IIB and IIIA was significant (p=0.001) there was no significant difference between IA and IB, between IB and IIA, between IIA and IIB, between IIIA and IIIB, or between IIIB and IV. In stage IV there was a significant difference in survival between patients with pulmonary metastases or distant extrapulmonary metastases (p=0.001). In multivariate analysis, we also found gender and histology to be independent significant prognostic factors for survival. Multiple factors influence the long-term survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer after surgical resection. The present stage related prognosis seems to characterize patient prognosis and outcome reliable. For further data review there should be a focus on stage IV disease",

abstract="The sharp dose gradients which are possible in intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) not only offer the possibility of generating excellent target coverage while sparing neighbouring organs at risk, but can also lead to treatment plans which are very sensitive to uncertainties in treatment variables such as the range of individual Bragg peaks. We developed a method to account for uncertainties of treatment variables in the optimization based on a worst case dose distribution. The worst case dose distribution is calculated using several possible realizations of the uncertainties. This information is used by the objective function of the inverse treatment planning system to generate treatment plans which are acceptable under all considered realizations of the uncertainties. The worst case optimization method was implemented in our in-house treatment planning software KonRad in order to demonstrate the usefulness of this approach for clinical cases. In this paper, we investigated range uncertainties, setup uncertainties and a combination of both uncertainties. Using our method the sensitivity of the resulting treatment plans to these uncertainties is considerably reduced",

Using these parameters, the computer program calculated the dose within a uniform volume of water in the presence of respiratory motion.

abstract="The article reports a feasibility study about the potentiality of an in vivo dosimetry method for the adaptive radiotherapy of the lung tumors treated by 3D conformal radiotherapy techniques (3D CRTs). At the moment image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) has been used for this aim, but it requires taking many periodic radiological images during the treatment that increase workload and patient dose. In vivo dosimetry reported here can reduce the above efforts, alerting the medical staff for the commissioning of new radiological images for an eventual adaptive plan. The in vivo dosimetry method applied on 20 patients makes use of the transit signal St on the beam central axis measured by a small ion chamber positioned on an electronic portal imaging device (EPID) or by the EPID itself. The reconstructed in vivo dosimetry at the isocenter point Diso requires a convolution between the transit signal St and a dose reconstruction factor C that essentially depends on (i) tissue inhomogeneities along the beam central axis and (ii) the in-patient isocenter depth. The C factors, one for every gantry angle, are obtained by processing the patient's computed tomography scan. The method has been recently applied in some Italian centers to check the radiotherapy of pelvis, breast, head, and thorax treatments. In this work the dose reconstruction was carried out in five centers to check the Diso in the lung tumor during the 3D CRT, and the results have been used to detect the interfraction tumor anatomy variations that can require new CT imaging and an adaptive plan. In particular, in three centers a small ion chamber was positioned below the patient and used for the St measurement. In two centers, the St signal was obtained directly by 25 central pixels of an a-Si EPID, equipped with commercial software that enabled its use as a stable detector. A tolerance action level of +/- 6\% for every checked beam was assumed. This means that when a difference greater than 6\% between the predicted dose by the treatment planning system, Diso,TPS, and the Diso was observed, the clinical action started to detect possible errors. 60\% of the patients examined presented morphological changes during the treatment that were checked by the in vivo dosimetry and successively confirmed by the new CT scans. In this work, a patient that showed for all beams Diso values outside the tolerance level, new CT scans were commissioned for an adaptive plan. The lung dose volume histograms (DVHs) for a Diso,TPs=2 Gy for fraction suggested the adaptive plan to reduce the dose in lung tissue. The results of this research show that the dose guided radiotherapy (DGRT) by the Diso reconstruction was feasible for daily or periodic investigation on morphological lung tumor changes. In other words, since during 3D CRT treatments the anatomical lung tumor changes occur frequently, the DGRT can be well integrated with the IGRT",

abstract="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim was to evaluate the impact of a spacer gel on the dose distribution, applying three-dimensional conformal (3D CRT) and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) planning techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The injection of a spacer gel (10 ml SpaceOAR) was performed between the prostate and rectum under transrectal ultrasound guidance in 18 patients with prostate cancer. 3D CRT and IMRT treatment plans were compared based on CT before and after injection (78 Gy prescription dose). RESULTS: In contrast to the PTV and bladder, significant advantages (p<0.01) resulted in respect of all analysed rectal dose values comparing pre spacer with post spacer plans for both techniques. Rectal NTCP (normal tissue complication probability) reached the lowest percentage after spacer injection irrespective of the technique, with a mean reduction of >50\% for both IMRT and 3D CRT. Significantly (p<0.01) higher D(mean), and V(78) for the PTV were reached with IMRT vs. 3D CRT plans, with a smaller rectum V(76) but larger rectum V(50). CONCLUSIONS: The injection of a spacer gel between the prostate and anterior rectal wall is associated with considerably lower doses to the rectum and consequentially lower NTCP values irrespective of the radiotherapy technique",

abstract="To investigate, with dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and a fiducial marker, the influence of different breathing maneuvers on internal organ and external chest wall motion.Methods and materials: Lung and chest wall motion of 16 healthy subjects (13 male, 3 female) were examined with real-time trueFISP (true fast imaging with steady-state precession) dMRI and a small inductively coupled marker coil on either the abdomen or thorax. Three different breathing maneuvers were performed (predominantly ``abdominal breathing,'' ``thoracic breathing,'' and unspecific ``normal breathing''). The craniocaudal (CC), anteroposterior (AP), and mediolateral (ML) lung distances were correlated (linear regression coefficient) with marker coil position during forced and quiet breathing.Results: Differences of the CC distance between maximum forced inspiration and expiration were significant between abdominal and thoracic breathing (p r = 0.89 \${\backslash}pm\$ 0.04); for AP and ML distance, forced thoracic breathing and a coil in the thoracic position was best (r = 0.84 \${\backslash}pm\$ 0.03 and 0.82 \${\backslash}pm\$ 0.03, respectively). In quiet breathing, a lower correlation was found.Conclusion: A fiducial marker coil external to the thorax in combination with dMRI is a new technique to yield quantitative information on the correlation of internal organ and external chest wall motion.

abstract="PURPOSE: A randomized radiotherapy dose escalation trial was undertaken between 1993 and 1998 to compare the efficacy of 70 vs. 78 Gy in controlling prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 305 Stage T1-T3 patients were entered into the trial and, of these, 301 with a median follow-up of 60 months, were assessable. Of the 301 patients, 150 were in the 70 Gy arm and 151 were in the 78 Gy arm. The primary end point was freedom from failure (FFF), including biochemical failure, which was defined as 3 rises in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were calculated from the completion of radiotherapy. The log-rank test was used to compare the groups. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to examine the independence of study randomization in multivariate analysis. RESULTS: There was an even distribution of patients by randomization arm and stage, Gleason score, and pretreatment PSA level. The FFF rates for the 70- and 78 Gy arms at 6 years were 64\% and 70\%, respectively (p = 0.03). Dose escalation to 78 Gy preferentially benefited those with a pretreatment PSA >10 ng/mL; the FFF rate was 62\% for the 78 Gy arm vs. 43\% for those who received 70 Gy (p = 0.01). For patients with a pretreatment PSA <or=10 ng/mL, no significant dose response was found, with an average 6-year FFF rate of about 75\%. Although no difference occurred in overall survival, the freedom from distant metastasis rate was higher for those with PSA levels >10 ng/mL who were treated to 78 Gy (98\% vs. 88\% at 6 years, p = 0.056). Rectal side effects were also significantly greater in the 78 Gy group. Grade 2 or higher toxicity rates at 6 years were 12\% and 26\% for the 70 Gy and 78 Gy arms, respectively (p = 0.001). Grade 2 or higher bladder complications were similar at 10\%. For patients in the 78 Gy arm, Grade 2 or higher rectal toxicity correlated highly with the proportion of the rectum treated to >70 Gy. CONCLUSION: An increase of 8 Gy resulted in a highly significant improvement in FFF for patients at intermediate-to-high risk, although the rectal reactions were also increased. Dose escalation techniques that limit the rectal volume that receives >or=70 Gy to <25\% should be used",

abstract="Purpose The objective of this work was to demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring low-exposure megavoltage cone-beam CT (MV CBCT) three-dimensional (3D) image data of sufficient quality to register the CBCT images to kilovoltage planning CT images for patient alignment and dose verification purposes.Methods and materials A standard clinical 6-MV Primus linear accelerator, operating in arc therapy mode, and an amorphous-silicon (a-Si) flat-panel electronic portal-imaging device (EPID) were employed. The dose-pulse rate of a 6-MV Primus accelerator beam was windowed to expose an a-Si flat panel by using only 0.02 to 0.08 monitor units (MUs) per image. A triggered image-acquisition mode was designed to produce a high signal-to-noise ratio without pulsing artifacts. Several data sets were acquired for an anthropomorphic head phantom and frozen sheep and pig cadaver heads, as well as for a head-and-neck cancer patient on intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). For each CBCT image, a set of 90 to 180 projection images incremented by 1[degree sign] to 2[degree sign] was acquired. The two-dimensional (2D) projection images were then synthesized into a 3D image by use of cone-beam CT reconstruction. The resulting MV CBCT image set was used to visualize the 3D bony anatomy and some soft-tissue details. The 3D image registration with the kV planning CT was performed either automatically by application of a maximization of mutual information (MMI) algorithm or manually by aligning multiple 2D slices.Results Low-noise 3D MV CBCT images without pulsing artifacts were acquired with a total delivered dose that ranged from 5 to 15 cGy. Acquisition times, including image readout, were on the order of 90 seconds for 180 projection images taken through a continuous gantry rotation of 180[degree sign]. The processing time of the data required an additional 90 seconds for the reconstruction of a 2563 cube with 1.0-mm voxel size. Implanted gold markers (1 mm x 3 mm) were easily visible for all exposure levels without artifacts. In general, the presence of high Z materials such as tooth fillings or implanted markers did not result in visible streak artifacts. The registration of structures such as the spinal canal and the nasopharynx in the MV CBCT and kV CT data sets was possible with millimeter and degree accuracy as assessed by displacement simulations and subsequent visual evaluation.Conclusions We believe that the quality of these images, along with the rapid acquisition and reconstruction times, demonstrates that MV CBCT performed by use of a standard linear accelerator equipped with a flat-panel imager can be applied clinically for patient alignment",

abstract="PURPOSE: To develop a method that allows a commercial treatment planning system (TPS) to perform accurate dose reconstruction for rigidly moving targets and to validate the method in phantom measurements for a range of treatments including intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), volumetric arc therapy (VMAT), and dynamic multileaf collimator (DMLC) tracking. METHODS: An in-house computer program was developed to manipulate Dicom treatment plans exported from a TPS (Eclipse, Varian Medical Systems) such that target motion during treatment delivery was incorporated into the plans. For each treatment, a motion including plan was generated by dividing the intratreatment target motion into 1 mm position bins and construct sub-beams that represented the parts of the treatment that were delivered, while the target was located within each position bin. For each sub-beam, the target shift was modeled by a corresponding isocenter shift. The motion incorporating Dicom plans were reimported into the TPS, where dose calculation resulted in motion including target dose distributions. For experimental validation of the dose reconstruction a thorax phantom with a moveable lung equivalent rod with a tumor insert of solid water was first CT scanned. The tumor insert was delineated as a gross tumor volume (GTV), and a planning target volume (PTV) was formed by adding margins. A conformal plan, two IMRT plans (step-and-shoot and sliding windows), and a VMAT plan were generated giving minimum target doses of 95\% (GTV) and 67\% (PTV) of the prescription dose (3 Gy). Two conformal fields with MLC leaves perpendicular and parallel to the tumor motion, respectively, were generated for DMLC tracking. All treatment plans were delivered to the thorax phantom without tumor motion and with a sinusoidal tumor motion. The two conformal fields were delivered with and without portal image guided DMLC tracking based on an embedded gold marker. The target dose distribution was measured with a radiochromic film in the moving rod and compared with the reconstructed doses using gamma tests. RESULTS: Considerable interplay effects between machine motion and target motion were observed for the treatments without tracking. For nontracking experiments, the mean 2 mm2\% gamma pass rate over all investigated scenarios was 99.6\% between calculated and measured doses. For tracking experiments, the mean gamma pass rate was 99.4\%. CONCLUSIONS: A method for accurate dose reconstruction for moving targets with dynamic treatments was developed and experimentally validated in a variety of delivery scenarios. The method is suitable for integration into TPSs, e.g., for reconstruction of the dose delivered to moving tumors or calculation of target doses delivered with DMLC tracking",

Therefore, a positron emission tomograph has been mounted directly at the treatment site. A fully 3D reconstruction algorithm based on the maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) algorithm has been developed and adapted to this spatially varying imaging situation. The scatter and attenuation correction are included in the forward projection step of the maximum likelihood image reconstruction. This requires an attenuation map containing the information on the material composition and densities. This information is derived from the x-ray computed tomograms of the patient and the patient fixation system including the head-rest. The normalization of scattered events relative to the unscattered events is done by a global scatter fraction factor which is estimated by means of a Monte Carlo simulation. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm is shown by means of computer simulations, phantom measurements as well as patient data",

abstract="At the carbon ion therapy facility of GSI Darmstadt in-beam positron emission tomography (PET) is used for imaging the beta+-activity distributions which are produced via nuclear fragmentation reactions between the carbon ions and the atomic nuclei of the irradiated tissue. On the basis of these PET images the quality of the irradiation, i.e. the position of the field, the particle range in vivo and even local deviations between the planned and the applied dose distribution, can be evaluated. However, for such an evaluation the measured beta+-activity distributions have to be compared with those predicted from the treatment plan. The predictions are calculated as follows: a Monte Carlo event generator produces list mode data files of the same format as the PET scanner in order to be processed like the measured ones for tomographic reconstruction. The event generator models the whole chain from the interaction of the projectiles with the target, i.e. their stopping and nuclear reactions, the production and the decay of positron emitters, the motion of the positrons as well as the propagation and the detection of the annihilation photons. The steps of the modelling, the experimental validation and clinical implementation are presented",

abstract="The image quality in a conventional positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scanner is degraded by respiratory motion because of erroneous attenuation correction when three-dimensional image acquisition is used. To overcome this problem, time-resolved data acquisition (4D) is required. For this, a Siemens Biograph 16 PET/CT scanner has been modified and its normal capability has been extended to a true 4D-PET/4D-CT imaging device including phase-correlated attenuation correction. To verify the correct functionality of this device, experiments on a respiratory motion phantom that allowed movement in two dimensions have been performed. The measurements showed good spatial correlation as well as good time synchronization between the PET and CT data. Furthermore, the motion pattern of the phantom and the shape of the activity distribution have been examined, and the volume of the reconstructed PET images has been analyzed. The results demonstrate the feasibility of such a procedure, and we therefore recommend that 4D-PET data should be reconstructed using 4D-CT data, which can be acquired on the same machine",

abstract="PURPOSE: Rectal toxicity remains a serious complication affecting quality of life for prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. We began an investigational trial injecting hyaluronic acid (HA) in the perirectal fat to increase the distance between the prostate and the anterior rectal wall. This is the first report using HA injection in oncology. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This is a trial of external beam radiation therapy with HDR brachytherapy boosts in prostate cancer. During the two high-dose-rate (HDR) fractions, thermoluminescent dosimeter dosimeters were placed in the urethra and in the rectum. Before the second HDR fraction, 3-7 mL (mean, 6 mL) of HA was injected under transrectal ultrasound guidance in the perirectal fat to systematically create a 1.5-cm space. Urethral and rectal HDR doses were calculated and measured. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were used to assess the stability of the new space. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients enrolled in the study. No toxicity was produced from the HA or the injection. In follow-up computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, the HA injection did not migrate or change in mass/shape for close to 1 year. The mean distance between rectum and prostate was 2.0 cm along the entire length of the prostate. The median measured rectal dose, when normalized to the median urethral dose, demonstrated a decrease in dose from 47.1\% to 39.2\% (p < 0.001) with or without injection. For an HDR boost dose of 1150 cGy, the rectum mean Dmax reduction was from 708 cGy to 507 cGy, p < 0.001, and the rectum mean Dmean drop was from 608 to 442 cGy, p < 0.001 post-HA injection. CONCLUSION: The new 2-cm distance derived from the HA injection significantly decreased rectal dose in HDR brachytherapy. Because of the several-month duration of stability, the same distance was maintained during the course of external beam radiation therapy",

The aim of this phantom-based study was to evaluate the option of diagnostic ultrasound (US) imaging (sonography) as real-time motion detection method for scanned heavy ion beam irradiation of moving targets. METHODS: For this pilot experiment, a tumor surrogate was moved inside a water bath along two-dimensional trajectories. A rubber ball was used for this purpose. This ball was moved by a robotic arm in two dimensions lateral to the heavy ion beam. Trajectories having a period of 3 s and peak to peak amplitude of 20 mm were used. Square radiation fields of[Formula: see text] were irradiated on radiosensitive films with a 200 MeV/u beam of calcium ions having a FWHM of 6 mm. Pencil beam scanning and beam tracking were employed. The films were attached on the robotic arm and thus moved with the rubber ball. The position of the rubber ball was continuously measured by a US tracking system (Mediri GmbH, Heidelberg) and sent to the GSI therapy control system (TCS). This position was used as tracking vector. Position reconstruction from the US tracking system and data communication introduced a delay leading to a position error of several millimeters. An artificial neural network (ANN) was implemented in the TCS to predict motion from US measurements and thus to compensate for the delay. RESULTS: Using ANN delay compensation and large motion amplitudes, the authors could produce irradiation patterns with a few percent inhomogeneity and about 1 mm geometrical conformity. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot experiment suggests that diagnostic US should be further investigated as dose-free, high frame-rate, and model-independent motion detection method for scanning heavy ion beam irradiation of moving targets",

abstract="Understanding the critical lesions induced by ionizing radiation in DNA and their relationship to cellular effects is an important challenge in radiation biology. Much evidence has suggested that DNA double-strand breaks (dsb) are important lesions. Establishing a cause and effect relationship between initial levels of DNA dsb, their repair rate or the level of residual unrepaired breaks, and cellular effects has proved difficult in mammalian cells. Several studies have measured yields of DNA dsb after irradiation with radiations of differing linear energy transfer (LET). In general the RBEs for dsb induction (20-100 keV/microns) have been lower than the RBEs measured for cell survival and in many cases are around 1.0. Several studies have shown differences in the rejoining of dsb with less dsb rejoined after high-LET irradiation in comparison with low-LET radiation. These results suggest that there may be differences in the types of lesions induced by different radiations and scored as DNA dsb using current techniques. Track structure modelling studies have suggested that some lesions induced will be clustered at the sites of energy depositions and that uniquely large energy deposition events are produced by high-LET radiations. Assays need to be developed to measure complex lesions in both model DNA and cellular systems. Different levels of complexity need to be considered such as clustering of radicals close to DNA, localized areas of DNA damage (1-20 bp) and lesions which may be induced over larger distances. Studies using new and existing assays of DNA damage, coupled with irradiation at various LETs, are directed at understanding the role of lesion complexity in relation to cellular effects",

abstract="PURPOSE: 2-Nitro-alpha-[(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)methyl]-imidazole-1-ethanol (TF-MISO) was investigated as a potential noninvasive marker of tissue oxygen levels in tumors using (19)F magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and (19)F chemical shift imaging. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS: In vitro data were obtained using high-performance liquid chromatography on tumor cells incubated under varying oxygen conditions to determine the oxygen-binding characteristics. In vivo data were obtained using a well-characterized hypoxic murine breast tumor (MCa), in addition to studies on a rat prostate tumor model (R3327-AT) implanted in nude mice. Detection of intratumor (19)F signal from TF-MISO was done using MRS for up to 10 h following a 75 mg/kg i.v. injection. Localized distribution of the compound in the implanted MCa tumor has been imaged using slice-selective two-dimensional chemical shift imaging 6 h after injection. RESULTS: The in vitro results showed that TF-MISO preferentially accumulates in cells incubated under anoxic conditions. The in vivo (19)F MR spectral features (line width and chemical shift) were recorded as a function of time after injection, and the results indicate that the fluorine atoms are indeed sensitive to changes in the local environment while still providing a detectable MR signal. Ex vivo spectra were collected and established the visibility of the (19)F signal under conditions of maximum hypoxia. Late time point (>6 h) tumor tissue concentrations, as obtained from (19)F MRS, suggest that TF-MISO is reduced and retained in hypoxic tumor. The feasibility of obtaining TF-MISO tumor distribution maps in a reasonable time frame was established. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results presented herein, it is suggested that TF-MISO has the potential to be a valid magnetic resonance hypoxia imaging reporter for both preclinical hypoxia studies and hypoxia-directed clinical therapy",

abstract="Atrial fibrillation (AF) has had a rich history that has touched the careers of many of the great clinicians and investigators of the 20th century. More recently, there has been an explosion of research into various aspects of the mechanisms and therapy for AF, as evidenced by over 8,000 publications on AF from 2000 to 2007. A century of research and clinical observations, coupled with modern investigative technologies, has enabled modern investigators to have their own ``fantastic voyage'' as they travel beyond the cell borders into the ionic mechanisms responsible for AF and its many atrial perturbations. One can only imagine the satisfaction of Wenckebach, MacKenzie, and Lewis if they could see how their seeds of wisdom have grown into such sturdy ideas, or how delighted Scherf would be to learn that his ectopic focus theory for AF has been given new life. This paper on 100 years of AF was initially prepared for presentation as the Plenary Lecture at the AFib Summit for Heart Rhythm 2007 in Denver, Colorado. I have tried to provide the reader with some of the most important observations on AF, realizing that it would be impossible to include all or even most of the major research done during this time frame. I apologize to my many colleagues whose research has helped us to understand better the clinical and basic aspects of AF, yet who could not be cited for lack of space",

abstract="An image-guidance process for using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) of peripheral lung lesions is presented. Respiration correlated CBCT on the treatment unit and four dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) from planning are evaluated for assessing respiration-induced target motion during planning and treatment fractions. Image-guided SBRT was performed for 12 patients (13 lesions) with inoperable early stage non-small cell lung carcinoma. Kilovoltage (kV) projections were acquired over a 360 degree gantry rotation and sorted based on the pixel value of an image-based aperture located at the air-tissue interface of the diaphragm. The sorted projections were reconstructed to provide volumetric respiration correlated CBCT image datasets at different phases of the respiratory cycle. The 4D volumetric datasets were directly compared with 4DCT datasets acquired at the time of planning. For ten of 12 patients treated, the lung tumour motion, as measured by respiration correlated CBCT on the treatment unit, was consistent with the tumour motion measured by 4DCT at the time of planning. However, in two patients, maximum discrepancies observed were 6 and 10 mm in the anterior-posterior and superior-inferior directions, respectively. Respiration correlated CBCT acquired on the treatment unit allows target motion to be assessed for each treatment fraction, allows target localization based on different phases on the breathing cycle, and provides the facility for adaptive margin design in radiation therapy of lung malignancies. The current study has shown that the relative motion and position of the tumour at the time of treatment may not match that of the planning 4DCT scan. Therefore, application of breathing motion data acquired at simulation for tracking or gating radiation therapy may not be suitable for all patients - even those receiving short course treatment techniques such as SBRT",

abstract="Cardiac and respiratory motion artefacts in PET imaging have been traditionally resolved by acquiring the data in gated mode. However, gated PET images are usually characterized by high noise content due to their low photon statistics. In this paper, we present a novel 4D model for the PET imaging system, which can incorporate motion information to generate a motion-free image with all acquired data. A computer simulation and a phantom study were conducted to test the performance of this approach. The computer simulation was based on a digital phantom that was continuously scaled during data acquisition. The phantom study, on the other hand, used two spheres in a tank of water, all of which were filled with (18)F water. One of the spheres was stationary while the other moved in a sinusoidal fashion to simulate tumour motion in the thorax. Data were acquired using both 4D CT and gated PET. Motion information was derived from the 4D CT images and then used in the 4D PET model. Both studies showed that this 4D PET model had a good motion-compensating capability. In the phantom study, this approach reduced quantification error of the radioactivity concentration by 95\% when compared to a corresponding static acquisition, while signal-to-noise ratio was improved by 210\% when compared to a corresponding gated image",

abstract="A motion-incorporated reconstruction (MIR) method for gated PET imaging has recently been developed by several authors to correct for respiratory motion artifacts in PET imaging. This method however relies on a motion map derived from images (4D PET or 4D CT) of the entire field of view (FOV). In this study we present a region of interest (ROI)-based extension to this method, whereby only the motion map of a user-defined ROI is required and motion incorporation during image reconstruction is solely performed within the ROI. A phantom study and an NCAT computer simulation study were performed to test the feasibility of this method. The phantom study showed that the ROI-based MIR produced results that are within 1.26\% of those obtained by the full image-based MIR approach when using the same accurate motion information. The NCAT phantom study on the other hand, further verified that motion of features of interest in an image can be estimated more efficiently and potentially more accurately using the ROI-based approach. A reduction of motion estimation time from 450 s to 30 and 73 s was achieved for two different ROIs respectively. In addition, the ROI-based approach showed a reduction in registration error of 43\% for one ROI, which effectively reduced quantification bias by 44\% and 32\% using mean and maximum voxel values, respectively",

abstract="Most information on results with radiotherapy (RT) for stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is based on retrospective studies on RT-treated inoperable NSCLC cases. Thus, the role of RT for stage I NSCLC, as a curative modality, has not yet been established. A literature search for studies on stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) treated by RT alone resulted in 18 papers published between 1988 and 2000. The majority of stage I patients received RT treatment because they were medically inoperable. The main contraindications for surgery were grave impairment of pulmonary function and serious cardiovascular disease. Local recurrence was the most common reason for treatment failure (median value 40\%) but varied highly between the studies, ranging from 6.4 to 70\%. In contrast with local recurrence, regional failure was not a major problem (0-3.2\%). Generally, smaller tumour size, low T-stage and increased dose had a favourable impact on local control and increased local control was followed by increased survival. No serious treatment complications were recorded in the majority of these studies. Overall treatment results were, however, disappointing. The median survival in these studies ranged from 18 to 33 months. The 3- and 5-year overall survival was 34+/-9 and 21+/-8\% (mean value+/-1 S.E.), respectively. The cause-specific survival at 3 and 5 years was 39+/-10 and 25+/-9\% (mean value+/-1 S.E.), respectively. Dose escalation, in a setting with conformal RT using involved field or stereotactic RT, should be the focus of developmental therapeutic strategies with inoperable stage I NSCLC to improve local control and survival",

abstract="Tumor motion induced by respiration presents a challenge to the reliable delivery of conformal radiation treatments. Real-time motion compensation represents the technologically most challenging clinical solution but has the potential to overcome the limitations of existing methods. The performance of a real-time couch-based motion compensation system is mainly dependent on two aspects: the ability to infer the internal anatomical position and the performance of the feedback control system. In this paper, we propose two novel methods for the two aspects respectively, and then combine the proposed methods into one system. To accurately estimate the internal tumor position, we present partial-least squares (PLS) regression to predict the position of the diaphragm using skin-based motion surrogates. Four radio-opaque markers were placed on the abdomen of patients who underwent fluoroscopic imaging of the diaphragm. The coordinates of the markers served as input variables and the position of the diaphragm served as the output variable. PLS resulted in lower prediction errors compared with standard multiple linear regression (MLR). The performance of the feedback control system depends on the system dynamics and dead time (delay between the initiation and execution of the control action). While the dynamics of the system can be inverted in a feedback control system, the dead time cannot be inverted. To overcome the dead time of the system, we propose a predictive feedback control system by incorporating forward prediction using least-mean-square (LMS) and recursive least square (RLS) filtering into the couch-based control system. Motion data were obtained using a skin-based marker. The proposed predictive feedback control system was benchmarked against pure feedback control (no forward prediction) and resulted in a significant performance gain. Finally, we combined the PLS inference model and the predictive feedback control to evaluate the overall performance of the feedback control system. Our results show that, with the tumor motion unknown but inferred by skin-based markers through the PLS model, the predictive feedback control system was able to effectively compensate intra-fraction motion",

abstract="Many methods exist to improve treatment outcome in radiotherapy. Two of these are image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) and proton therapy. IGRT aims at a more precise delivery of the radiation, while proton therapy is able to achieve more conformal dose distributions. In order to maximally exploit the sharp dose gradients from proton therapy it has to be combined with soft-tissue based IGRT. MRI-guided photon therapy (currently under development) offers unequalled soft-tissue contrast and real-time image guidance. A hybrid MRI proton therapy system would combine these advantages with the advantageous dose steering capacity of proton therapy. This paper addresses a first technical feasibility issue of this concept, namely the impact of a 0.5 T magnetic field on the dose distribution from a 90 MeV proton beam. In contrast to photon therapy, for MR-guided proton therapy the impact of the magnetic field on the dose distribution is very small. At tissue-air interfaces no effect of the magnetic field on the dose distribution can be detected. This is due to the low-energy of the secondary electrons released by the heavy protons",

From the initial design onwards, modifications to both systems were aimed to yield simultaneous and unhampered operation of the MRI and the accelerator. Indeed, the simultaneous operation is shown by performing diagnostic quality 1.5 T MRI with the radiation beam on. No degradation of the performance of either system was found. The integrated 1.5 T MRI system and radiotherapy accelerator allow simultaneous irradiation and MR imaging. The full diagnostic imaging capacities of the MRI can be used; dedicated sequences for MRI-guided radiotherapy treatments will be developed.

abstract="The purpose of this work is to demonstrate a proof of feasibility of the application of a commercial prototype deformable model algorithm to the problem of delineation of anatomic structures on four-dimensional (4D) computed tomography (CT) image data sets. We acquired a 4D CT image data set of a patient's thorax that consisted of three-dimensional (3D) image data sets from eight phases in the respiratory cycle. The contours of the right and left lungs, cord, heart, and esophagus were manually delineated on the end inspiration data set. An interactive deformable model algorithm, originally intended for deforming an atlas-based model surface to a 3D CT image data set, was applied in an automated fashion. Triangulations based on the contours generated on each phase were deformed to the CT data set on the succeeding phase to generate the contours on that phase. Deformation was propagated through the eight phases, and the contours obtained on the end inspiration data set were compared with the original manually delineated contours. Structures defined by high-density gradients, such as lungs, cord, and heart, were accurately reproduced, except in regions where other gradient boundaries may have confused the algorithm, such as near bronchi. The algorithm failed to accurately contour the esophagus, a soft-tissue structure completely surrounded by tissue of similar density, without manual interaction. This technique has the potential to facilitate contour delineation in 4D CT image data sets; and future evolution of the software is expected to improve the process",

abstract="The results of a comparative study of heavy particles of interest in radiotherapy are reported in four parts. In this Part III, cell-survival measurements under aerobic and hypoxic conditions were made for various heavy particle beams. For heavy charged-particle beams, the measurements were made at the beam entrance (plateau), peak centre (10 cm wide peaks), and distal peak (1 cm from dose fall-off). Chinese hamster cells (V79) were used. Metabolic depletion was used to obtain hypoxia. The results indicate that the differences in RBE between the entrance region and peak are not very large when the Bragg peaks are broadened to 10 cm. The RBE for argon ions remains the same at the entrance and peak centre, and the RBE at the distal side of the Bragg peak is significantly reduced compared to the peak centre and entrance region because of saturation effects at high LET. The OER for protons is not significantly different from that for X rays. The OER for helium ions, carbon ions, and negative pions is larger, for neon ions is similar, and for argon ions is smaller when compared with fast neutrons. The OER values for heavy ions are higher than expected and could be due to a large delta-ray penumbra associated with the energy deposited by energetic heavy ions. The oxygen effect may depend upon energy deposition over distances of the order of nanometers",

MR dosimetry measurements were compared with data from a planning system. As far as quality is concerned, there is good agreement between the measured dose distributions of both samples and the dose maps from the planning software. The measured MR signals cannot be converted into absolute dose, since the relative efficiency is still unknown for mixed radiation fields of primary carbon ions and it is known only to a limited extent for nuclear fragments with different energies from highly energetic photon radiation.

abstract="One major limitation of three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy that has not been adequately addressed is respiration-induced organ motion. During respiration, tumors in the abdomen can typically move from 1 to 3 centimeters. Because the size and shape of external radiation treatment fields do not change during treatment, the field size of the x-ray beam must be enlarged to encompass the tumor through the entire respiration cycle. Several manufacturers are developing respiratory gating systems. These systems allow the selective delivery of absorbed doses to moving target volumes in the abdomen during time intervals when the target volume is within the intended location. Before respiratory gated radiotherapy can be implemented clinically, the efficacy of the procedure must be justified. The magnitude of dosimetric and geometric uncertainties associated with respiratory motion must be identified to determine if gating can provide an advantage over conventional treatment techniques. In addition, clinical situations and specific types of cancer that could benefit from respiratory gating must also be identified",

abstract="The goal of this article is to present the algorithm for DMLC leaf control capable of delivering IMRT to tumors that experience motion in two dimensions in the beams eye view (BEV) plane. The generic, two-dimensional (2D) motion of the projection of the rigid target on BEV plane can be divided into two components. The first component describes the motion of the projection of the target along the x axis (parallel to the MLC leaf motions) and the other describes the motion of the target projection on the y axis (perpendicular to the leaf motion direction). First, time optimal leaf trajectories are calculated independently for each leaf pair of the MLC assembly to compensate the x-axis component of the 2D motion of the target on the BEV. These leaf trajectories are then synchronized following the mid time (MT) synchronization procedure. To compensate for the y-axis component of the motion of the target projection on the BEV plane, the procedure of ``switching'' leaf pair trajectories in the upward (or downward) direction is executed when the target's BEV projection moves upward (or downward) from its equilibrium position along the y axis. When the intensity function is a 2D histogram, the error between the intended and delivered intensity in 2D DMLC IMRT delivery will depend on the shape of the intensity map and on the MLC physical constraint (leaf width and maximum admissible leaf speed). The MT synchronization of leaf trajectories decreases the impact of above constraints on the error in 2D DMLC IMRT intensity map delivery. The proof is provided, that if hardware constraints in the 2D DMLC IMRT delivery strategy are removed, the errors between planned and delivered 2D intensity maps are entirely eliminated. Examples of 2D DMLC IMRT delivery to rigid targets moving along elliptical orbits on BEV planes are calculated and analyzed for 20 clinical fluence maps. The comparisons between the intensity delivered without motion correction, with motion correction along x axis only, and with motion correction for full 2D motion of the target are calculated and quantitatively evaluated. The fluence maps were normalized to 100 MU and the rms difference between the desired and delivered fluence was 12 MU for no motion compensation, 11.18 MU for 1D compensation, and 4.73 MU for 2D motion compensations. The advantage of correcting for full 2D motion of target projected on the BEV plane is demonstrated",

abstract="PURPOSE: The highly conformal doses delivered by volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) may be compromised by intrafraction target motion. Although dynamic multileaf collimator (DMLC) tracking can mitigate the dosimetric impact of motion on the accumulated dose, residual errors still exist. The purpose of this study was to investigate the temporal evolution of dose errors throughout VMAT treatments delivered with and without DMLC tracking. METHODS: Tracking experiments were performed on a linear accelerator connected to prototype DMLC tracking software. A three-axis motion stage reproduced representative clinical trajectories of four lung tumors and four prostates. For each trajectory, two VMAT treatment plans (low and high modulation) were delivered with and without DMLC tracking as well as to a static phantom for reference. Dose distributions were measured continuously at 72 Hz using a dosimeter with biplanar diode arrays. During tracking, the MLC leaves were continuously refitted to the 3D target position measured by an electromagnetic transponder at 30 Hz. The dosimetric errors caused in the 32 motion experiments were quantified by a time-resolved 3\%/3 mm gamma-test. The erroneously exposed areas in treatment beam's eye view (BEV) caused by inadequate real-time MLC adaptation were calculated and compared with the time-resolved gamma failure rates. RESULTS: The transient gamma failure rate was on average 16.8\% without tracking and 5.3\% with tracking. The gamma failure rate correlated well with the erroneously exposed areas in BEV (mean of Pearson r = 0.83, p < 0.001). For the final accumulated doses, the mean gamma failure rate was 17.9\% without tracking and 1.0\% with tracking. With tracking the transient dose errors tended to cancel out resulting in the low mean gamma failure rate for the accumulated doses. CONCLUSIONS: Time-resolved measurements allow pinpointing of transient errors in dose during VMAT delivery as well as monitoring of erroneous dose evolution in key target positions. The erroneously exposed area in BEV was shown to be a good indicator of errors in the dose distribution during treatment delivery",

volume="77",

pages="194--201",
abstract="PurposeDetermining treatment margins for inter-fractional motion of moving and deformable clinical target volumes (CTVs) remains a major challenge. This paper describes and applies an optimisation algorithm designed to derive such margins.Material and methodsThe algorithm works by expanding the CTV, as determined from a pre-treatment or planning scan, to enclose the CTV positions observed during treatment. CTV positions during treatment may be obtained using, for example, repeat CT scanning and/or repeat electronic portal imaging (EPI). The algorithm can be applied to both individual patients and to a set of patients. The margins derived will minimise the excess volume outside the envelope that encloses all observed CTV positions (the CTV envelope). Initially, margins are set such that the envelope is more than adequately covered when the planning CTV is expanded. The algorithm uses an iterative method where the margins are sampled randomly and are then either increased or decreased randomly. The algorithm is tested on a set of 19 bladder cancer patients that underwent weekly repeat CT scanning and EPI throughout their treatment course.ResultsFrom repeated runs on individual patients, the algorithm produces margins within a range of ?{\backslash}textquestiondown{\backslash}textonehalf2\&amp;nbsp;mm that lie among the best results found with an exhaustive search approach, and that agree within 3\&amp;nbsp;mm with margins determined by a manual approach on the same data. The algorithm could be used to determine margins to cover any specified geometrical uncertainty, and allows for the determination of reduced margins by relaxing the coverage criteria, for example disregarding extreme CTV positions, or an arbitrarily selected volume fraction of the CTV envelope, and/or patients with extreme geometrical uncertainties.ConclusionAn optimisation approach to margin determination is found to give reproducible results within the accuracy required. The major advantage with this algorithm is that it is completely empirical, and it is therefore particularly useful for CTVs where the geometrical uncertainties are difficult to model, such as the bladder",

Methods and Materials Fifteen patients with centrally or superiorly located (within 2 cm of critical structures) stage I NSCLC were treated clinically with three-dimensional photon SBRT (50 Gy in 4 fractions). The photon SBRT plan was compared with the PSPT and IMPT plans. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the dose that exceeded the dose--volume constraints in the critical structures. Results Only 6 photon plans satisfied the >95\% planning target volume (PTV) coverage and MTD constraints, compared to 12 PSPT plans (p = 0.009) and 14 IMPT plans (p = 0.001). Compared with the photon SBRT plans, the PSPT and IMPT plans significantly reduced the mean total lung dose from 5.4 Gy to 3.5 Gy (p < 0.001) and 2.8 Gy (p < 0.001) and reduced the total lung volume receiving 5 Gy, 10 Gy, and 20 Gy (p < 0.001). When the PTV was within 2 cm of the critical structures, the PSPT and IMPT plans significantly reduced the mean maximal dose to the aorta, brachial plexus, heart, pulmonary vessels, and spinal cord. Conclusions For centrally or superiorly located stage I NSCLC, proton therapy, particularly IMPT, delivered ablative doses to the target volume and significantly reduced doses to the surrounding normal tissues compared with photon SBRT.",

abstract="Purpose: To provide an analytical description of the effect of random and systematic geometrical deviations on the target dose in radiotherapy and to derive margin rules.Methods and Materials: The cumulative dose distribution delivered to the clinical target volume (CTV) is expressed analytically. Geometrical deviations are separated into treatment execution (random) and treatment preparation (systematic) variations. The analysis relates each possible preparation (systematic) error to the dose distribution over the CTV and allows computation of the probability distribution of, for instance, the minimum dose delivered to the CTV.Results: The probability distributions of the cumulative dose over a population of patients are called dose-population histograms in short. Large execution (random) variations lead to CTV underdosage for a large number of patients, while the same level of preparation (systematic) errors leads to a much larger underdosage for some of the patients. A single point on the histogram gives a simple ?margin recipe.? For example, to ensure a minimum dose to the CTV of 95\% for 90\% of the patients, a margin between CTV and planning target volume (PTV) is required of 2.5 times the total standard deviation (SD) of preparation (systematic) errors (?) plus 1.64 times the total SD of execution (random) errors (??) combined with the penumbra width, minus 1.64 times the SD describing the penumbra width (?p). For a ?p of 3.2 mm, this recipe can be simplified to 2.5 ? + 0.7 ??. Because this margin excludes rotational errors and shape deviations, it must be considered as a lower limit for safe radiotherapy.Conclusion: Dose-population histograms provide insight into the effects of geometrical deviations on a population of patients. Using a dose-probability based approach, simple algorithms for choosing margins were derived",

abstract="One potential application of image-guided radiotherapy is to track the target motion in real time, then deliver adaptive treatment to a dynamic target by dMLC tracking or respiratory gating. However, the existence of a finite time delay (or a system latency) between the image acquisition and the response of the treatment system to a change in tumour position implies that some kind of predictive ability should be included in the real-time dynamic target treatment. If diagnostic x-ray imaging is used for the tracking, the dose given over a whole image-guided radiotherapy course can be significant. Therefore, the x-ray beam used for motion tracking should be triggered at a relatively slow pulse frequency, and an interpolation between predictions can be used to provide a fast tracking rate. This study evaluates the performance of an autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) model based prediction algorithm for reducing tumour localization error due to system latency and slow imaging rate. For this study, we use 3D motion data from ten lung tumour cases where the peak-to-peak motion is greater than 8 mm. Some strongly irregular traces with variation in amplitude and phase were included. To evaluate the prediction accuracy, the standard deviations between predicted and actual motion position are computed for three system latencies (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 s) at several imaging rates (1.25-10 Hz), and compared against the situation of no prediction. The simulation results indicate that the implementation of the prediction algorithm in real-time target tracking can improve the localization precision for all latencies and imaging rates evaluated. From a common initial setting of model parameters, the predictor can quickly provide an accurate prediction of the position after collecting 20 initial data points. In this retrospective analysis, we calculate the standard deviation of the predicted position from the twentieth position data to the end of the session at 0.1 s interval. For both regular and irregular lung tumour motions, with prediction the range of average errors is 0.4-2.5 mm in the SI direction from shorter to longer latency, corresponding to a range of 0.8-4.3 mm without prediction; for the AP direction a range of 0.3-1.6 mm is obtained with prediction, corresponding to a range of 0.6-3.0 mm without prediction. For 0.2 s and 0.4 s system latency, with prediction the localization based on a relatively slow imaging rate (2.5 Hz) can achieve a better or similar precision compared with no prediction but on a fast imaging rate (10 Hz). This means that precise localization can be realized at a slow imaging rate. This is important for the application of kV x-ray imaging systems and EPID-based systems in image-guided radiotherapy. In conclusion, the adaptive predictor can successfully predict irregular respiratory motion, and the adaptive prediction of respiration motion can effectively improve the delivery precision of real-time motion compensation radiotherapy",

abstract="In infrared patient setup adequate selection of the external fiducial configuration is required for compensating inner target displacements (target registration error, TRE). Genetic algorithms (GA) and taboo search (TS) were applied in a newly designed approach to optimal marker placement: the genetic evolutionary taboo search (GETS) algorithm. In the GETS paradigm, multiple solutions are simultaneously tested in a stochastic evolutionary scheme, where taboo-based decision making and adaptive memory guide the optimization process. The GETS algorithm was tested on a group of ten prostate patients, to be compared to standard optimization and to randomly selected configurations. The changes in the optimal marker configuration, when TRE is minimized for OARs, were specifically examined. Optimal GETS configurations ensured a 26.5\% mean decrease in the TRE value, versus 19.4\% for conventional quasi-Newton optimization. Common features in GETS marker configurations were highlighted in the dataset of ten patients, even when multiple runs of the stochastic algorithm were performed. Including OARs in TRE minimization did not considerably affect the spatial distribution of GETS marker configurations. In conclusion, the GETS algorithm proved to be highly effective in solving the optimal marker placement problem. Further work is needed to embed site-specific deformation models in the optimization process",

abstract="A key challenge in radiation oncology is accurate delivery of the prescribed dose to tumours that move because of respiration. Tumour tracking involves real-time target localisation and correction of radiation beam geometry to compensate for motion. Uncertainties in tumour localisation are important in particle therapy (proton therapy, carbon-ion therapy) because charged particle beams are highly sensitive to geometrical and associated density and radiological variations in path length, which will affect the treatment plan. Target localisation and motion compensation methods applied in x-ray photon radiotherapy require careful performance assessment for clinical applications in particle therapy. In this Review, we summarise the efforts required for an application of real-time tumour tracking in particle therapy, by comparing and assessing competing strategies for time-resolved target localisation and related clinical outcomes in x-ray radiation oncology",

abstract="Patients affected with early stage (IA-IB) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), deemed medically inoperable, are usually treated by conventional 3D-CRT, with poor results in terms of local tumour control and survival. Hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) appears to be a valid alternative option, with high rates of local control and promising survival rates according to recent reported series. We herein report the final results of a prospective phase II trial of SBRT in 62 stage I NSCLC patients, homogeneously treated with three fractions of 15 Gy each, given every other day during a 1 week time, up to a total dose of 45 Gy; dose was prescribed to the 80\%-isodose encompassing planning target volume. Patients were immobilized in a dedicated stereotactic body frame; margins around gross tumour volume were 5 mm in the axial plane and 10 mm in the longitudinal direction. Median age was 73.7 years. A pathologic confirmation of NSCLC was obtained in 64.5\% of patients. Forty-three patients had stage IA and 19 stage IB disease. The majority of patients did not experience any toxicity; mild skin reactions, fatigue, dyspnea/cough or transient thoracic pain were recorded in approximately 10\% of patients. With a median follow-up time of 28 months, 2 patients experienced an isolated local relapse, 4 an isolated nodal relapse and 15 a systemic failure. At 3 years, local control rate was 87.8\%, cancer-specific survival 72.5\%, overall survival 57.1\%, with 8 out of 20 non-cancer related deaths. In multivariate analysis, tumour volume was associated with a better outcome. In our series, SBRT was well tolerated and confirmed its efficacy, with local control and survival rates globally superior to those reported using conventional radiotherapy. A longer follow-up is needed in order to establish a correct comparison with surgical series, and to fully ascertain a potential negative impact of SBRT on comorbidities of such a fragile patients population.",

abstract="External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is a standard of care in the treatment of prostate cancer. Hypofractionation is a valid option either radiobiologically and logistically in this context. Image-guidance procedures are strongly needed to provide ballistic precision to radiation delivery. The Clarity platform allows for the acquisition of three-dimensional ultrasound scans (3D-US) to perform image-guided radiotherapy. We treated a consecutive series of intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients (according to NCCN stratification) with a hypofractionated schedule (70.2 Gy/26 fractions at 2.7 Gy/daily to the prostate gland excluding the seminal vesicles at 62.1 Gy) under 3D-US guidance with the Clarity platform. The 3-year biochemical-relapse-free survival, distant-metastases-free, cancer-specific and overall survival were 98.6\% (CI: 91.1-99.6\%), 98.6\% (CI: 91.1-99.6\%), 97.5\% (CI: 94.5-99.1\%), and 94.3\% (CI: 90.4-96.7\%), respectively. Maximum detected acute GU toxicity was G0 in 22 patients (29.7\%), G1 in 30 (22.7\%), G2 in 19 (25.6\%), G3 in 3 (4\%). Maximum detected acute GI toxicity at the end of EBRT was G0 in 42 patients (56.8\%), G1 in 22 (29.7\%), G2 in 9 (12.1\%), G3 in 1 (1.4\%). The 3-year actuarial rates of >/= G2 late toxicities were 6.1\% for genito-urinary and 8.9\% for gastrointestinal. The whole image-guidance workflow resulted in being robust and reliable. EBRT delivered employing a hypofractionated schedule under 3D-US-based image guidance proved to be a safe and effective treatment approach with consistent biochemical control and a mild toxicity profile. Hence, it has been transferred into daily clinical practice in our Department",

abstract="ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: To investigate the feasibility and accuracy of dose calculation in cone beam CT (CBCT) data sets. METHODS: Kilovoltage CBCT images were acquired with the Elekta XVI system, CT studies generated with a conventional multi-slice CT scanner (Siemens Somatom Sensation Open) served as reference images. Material specific volumes of interest (VOI) were defined for commercial CT Phantoms (CATPhan(R) and Gammex RMI(R)) and CT values were evaluated in CT and CBCT images. For CBCT imaging, the influence of image acquisition parameters such as tube voltage, with or without filter (F1 or F0) and collimation on the CT values was investigated. CBCT images of 33 patients (pelvis n=11, thorax n=11, head n=11) were compared with corresponding planning CT studies. Dose distributions for three different treatment plans were calculated in CT and CBCT images and differences were evaluated. Four different correction strategies to match CT values (HU) and density (D) in CBCT images were analysed: standard CT HU-D table without adjustment for CBCT; phantom based HU-D tables; patient group based HU-D tables (pelvis, thorax, head); and patient specific HU-D tables. RESULTS: CT values in the CBCT images of the CATPhan(R) were highly variable depending on the image acquisition parameters: a mean difference of 564 HU +/- 377 HU was calculated between CT values determined from the planning CT and CBCT images. Hence, two protocols were selected for CBCT imaging in the further part of the study and HU-D tables were always specific for these protocols (pelvis and thorax with M20F1 filter, 120 kV; head S10F0 no filter, 100kV). For dose calculation in real patient CBCT images, the largest differences between CT and CBCT were observed for the standard CT HU-D table: differences were 8.0 \% +/- 5.7 \%, 10.9 \% +/- 6.8 \% and 14.5 \% +/- 10.4 \% respectively for pelvis, thorax and head patients using clinical treatment plans. The use of patient and group based HU-D tables resulted in small dose differences between planning CT and CBCT: 0.9 \% +/- 0.9 \%, 1.8 \% +/- 1.6 \%, 1.5 \% +/- 2.5 \% for pelvis, thorax and head patients, respectively. The application of the phantom based HU-D table was acceptable for the head patients but larger deviations were determined for the pelvis and thorax patient populations. CONCLUSION: The generation of three HU-D tables specific for the anatomical regions pelvis, thorax and head and specific for the corresponding CBCT image acquisition parameters resulted in accurate dose calculation in CBCT images. Once these HU-D tables are created, direct dose calculation on CBCT datasets is possible without the need of a reference CT images for pixel value calibration",

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of a method for markerless tracking of lung tumors in electronic portal imaging device (EPID) movies and to analyze intra- and interfractional variations in tumor motion. METHODS AND MATERIALS: EPID movies were acquired during stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) given to 40 patients with 49 pulmonary targets and retrospectively analyzed. Tumor visibility and tracking accuracy were determined by three observers. Tumor motion of 30 targets was analyzed in detail via four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) and EPID in the superior-inferior direction for intra- and interfractional variations. RESULTS: Tumor visibility was sufficient for markerless tracking in 47\% of the EPID movies. Tumor size and visibility in the DRR were correlated with visibility in the EPID images. The difference between automatic and manual tracking was a maximum of 2 mm for 98.3\% in the x direction and 89.4\% in the y direction. Motion amplitudes in 4DCT images (range, 0.7-17.9 mm; median, 4.9 mm) were closely correlated with amplitudes in the EPID movies. Intrafractional and interfractional variability of tumor motion amplitude were of similar magnitude: 1 mm on average to a maximum of 4 mm. A change in moving average of more than +/-1 mm, +/-2 mm, and +/-4 mm were observed in 47.1\%, 17.1\%, and 4.5\% of treatment time for all trajectories, respectively. Mean tumor velocity was 3.4 mm/sec, to a maximum 61 mm/sec. CONCLUSIONS: Tracking of pulmonary tumors in EPID images without implanted markers was feasible in 47\% of all treatment beams. 4DCT is representative of the evaluation of mean breathing motion on average, but larger deviations occurred in target motion between treatment planning and delivery effort a monitoring during delivery",

abstract="Purpose: The aim of the work was to investigate the influence of intrafractional tumor motion to the accumulated (absorbed) dose. The accumulated dose was determined by means of calculations and measurements with a robot driven motion phantom.Methods: Different motion scenarios and compensation techniques were realized in a phantom study to investigate the influence of motion on image acquisition, dose calculation, and dose measurement. The influence of motion on the accumulated dose was calculated by employing two methods (a model based and a voxel based method).Results: Tumor motion resulted in a blurring of steep dose gradients and a reduction of dose at the periphery of the target. A systematic variation of motion parameters allowed the determination of the main influence parameters on the accumulated dose. The key parameters with the greatest influence on dose were the mean amplitude and the pattern of motion. Investigations on necessary safety margins to compensate for dose reduction have shown that smaller safety margins are sufficient, if the developed concept with optimized margins (OPT concept) was used instead of the standard internal target volume (ITV) concept. Both calculation methods were a reasonable approximation of the measured dose with the voxel based method being in better agreement with the measurements.Conclusions: Further evaluation of available systems and algorithms for dose accumulation are needed to create guidelines for the verification of the accumulated dose",

abstract="Purpose: Upgrade and benchmarking of a research 4D treatment planning system (4DTPS) suitable for realistic patient treatment planning and treatment simulations taking into account specific requirements for scanned ion beam therapy, i.e., modeling of dose heterogeneities due to interplay effects and range changes caused by patient motion and dynamic beam delivery.Methods: The 4DTPS integrates data interfaces to 4D computed tomography (4DCT), deformable image registration and clinically used motion monitoring devices. The authors implemented a novel data model for 4D image segmentation using Boolean mask volume datasets and developed an algorithm propagating a manually contoured reference contour dataset to all 4DCT phases. They further included detailed treatment simulation and dose reconstruction functionality, based on the irregular patient motion and the temporal structure of the beam delivery. The treatment simulation functionality was validated against experimental data from irradiation of moving radiographic films in air, 3D moving ionization chambers in a water phantom, and moving cells in a biological phantom with a scanned carbon ion beam. The performance of the program was compared to results obtained with predecessor programs.Results: The measured optical density distributions of the radiographic films were reproduced by the simulations to (-2 +/- 12)\%. Compared to earlier versions of the 4DTPS, the mean agreement improved by 2\%, standard deviations were reduced by 7\%. The simulated dose to the moving ionization chambers in water showed an agreement with the measured dose of (-1 +/- 4)\% for the typical beam configuration. The mean deviation of the simulated from the measured biologically effective dose determined via cell survival was (617 +/- 538) mGy relative biological effectiveness corresponding to (10 +/- 9)\%.Conclusions: The authors developed a research 4DTPS suitable for realistic treatment planning on patient data and capable of simulating dose delivery to a moving patient geometry for scanned ion beams. The accuracy and reliability of treatment simulations improved considerably with respect to earlier versions of the 4DTPS",

abstract="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Interplay effects may limit the applicability of scanned ion beam therapy for moving tumors even if the motion amplitude is reduced by techniques such as gating or abdominal compression (AC). We investigate the potential of enhanced pencil beam overlap to mitigate residual motion interplay effects in scanned ion beam therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight patients with hepato cellular carcinoma were selected who were either treated under AC (5 clinical target volumes (CTVs)) or with gating (6 CTVs). We performed 4D dose calculations for treatment plans with variable beam parameters (lateral raster spacing, beam full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM), iso-energy slice spacing, gating window (GW)) and assessed under- and overdose (V95 and V107), dose homogeneity (HI=D5-D95), and dose volume histograms. The influence of the beam parameters on HI was studied by multivariate regression models. RESULTS: Motion amplitude and FWHM had the largest impact on dose homogeneity, while decreased iso-energy slice spacing and lateral raster spacing had a much smaller or no significant effect, respectively. The multivariate regression models including FWHM, motion amplitude, and IES-spacing explained 86\%, 42\%, and 71\% of the observed variance for AC, 30\% and 50\% GW, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Residual motion in scanned carbon ion therapy of liver tumors can lead to considerable dose heterogeneities. Using an increased beam spot size dose degradation can be significantly mitigated. Especially for large tumors, increasing the beam spot size is an efficient motion mitigation option readily available at most scanning facilities",

abstract="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Clinical target volumes of the thorax and abdomen are typically expanded to account for inter- and intrafractional organ motion. Usually, such expansions are based on clinical experience and planar observations of target motion during simulation. More precise, 4-dimensional motion margins for a specific patient may improve dose coverage of mobile targets and yet limit unnecessarily large field expansions. We are studying approaches to targeting moving tumors throughout the entire treatment process, from treatment planning to beam delivery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Radio-opaque markers were implanted under CT guidance in the liver at the gross tumor periphery. Organ motion during light respiration was volumetrically imaged by 4D Computed Tomography. Marker motion was also acquired by fluoroscopy and compared with 4DCT data. During treatment, daily diagnostic x-ray images were captured at end-exhale and -inhale for patient setup and target localization. RESULTS: Based on the time-resolved CT data, target volumes can be designed to account for respiratory motion during treatment. Motion of the tumor as derived from 4DCT was consistent with fluoroscopic motion analysis. Radiographs acquired in the treatment room enabled millimeter-level patient set-up and assessment of target position relative to bony anatomy. Daily positional variations between bony anatomy and implanted markers were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Image guided therapy, based on 4DCT imaging, fluoroscopic imaging studies, and daily gated diagonstic energy set-up radiographs is being developed to improve beam delivery precision. Monitoring internal target motion throughout the entire treatment process will ensure adequate dose coverage of the target while sparing the maximum healthy tissue",

Evaluation of deformable registration using difference images of original and deformed anatomic maps suggested the algorithm is functionally useful. Thus, calculation of effective dose distributions, including respiratory motion, was implemented.Conclusion: Tools and methods to use 4D-CT data for treatment planning in the presence of respiratory motion have been developed and applied to several case studies.

Its value is determined by the fidelity of the spatiotemporal data set after processing the acquired reconstructed slices. Retrospective sorting of reconstructed slices is based on respiratory phase. However, the existing commercial software inadequately models respiratory phase for about 30\% of the patients, mainly due to irregularities in the respiratory cycle. We have developed software that improves phase determination and consequently leads to an improvement of retrospective data sorting to make 4DCT data acquisition feasible for routine clinical use. Peak inhalation and exhalation respiratory states are selected manually; intermediate phases are interpolated. Residual motion artifacts in the resulting 4DCT volumes are reduced and allow use of the 4D imaging studies for treatment planning",

abstract="PURPOSE: When using non-patient-specific treatment planning margins, respiratory motion may lead to geometric miss of the target while unnecessarily irradiating normal tissue. Imaging different respiratory states of a patient allows patient-specific target design. We used four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) to characterize tumor motion and create treatment volumes in 10 patients with lung cancer. These were compared with standard treatment volumes. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four-dimensional CT and free breathing helical CT data of 10 patients were acquired. Gross target volumes (GTV) were delineated on the helical scan as well as on each phase of the 4D data. Composite GTVs were defined on 4DCT. Planning target volumes (PTV) including clinical target volume, internal margin (IM), and setup margin were generated. 4DPTVs with different IMs and standard PTVs were compared by computing centroid positions, volumes, volumetric overlap, and bounding boxes. RESULTS: Four-dimensional PTVs and conventional PTVs differed in volume and centroid positions. Overlap between 4DPTVs generated from two extreme tumor positions only compared with 10 respiratory phases was 93.7\%. Comparing PTVs with margins of 15 mm (IM 5 mm) on composite 4D target volumes to PTVs with 20 mm (IM 10 mm) on helical CT data resulted in a decrease in target volume sizes by 23\% on average. CONCLUSION: With patient-specific characterization of tumor motion, it should be possible to decrease internal margins. Patient-specific treatment volumes can be generated using extreme tumor positions on 4DCT. To date, more than 150 patients have been treated using 4D target design",

This calibration can cause relevant differences between treatment planning and treatment delivery. METHODS: Calibration data for several soft tissues were measured repeatedly to assess the accuracy of range calibration. Samples of fresh animal tissues including fat, brain, kidney, liver, and several muscle tissues were used. First, samples were CT scanned. Then carbon ion radiographic measurements were performed at several positions. Residual ranges behind the samples were compared to ranges in water. RESULTS: Based on the measured data the accuracy of the current Hounsfield look-up table for range calibration of soft tissues is 0.2 +/- 1.2\%. Accuracy in range calibration of 1\% corresponds to {\textasciitilde}1 mm carbon ion range control in 10 cm water equivalent depth which is comparable to typical treatment depths for head and neck tumors. CONCLUSION: Carbon ion ranges can be controlled within {\textasciitilde}1 mm in soft tissue for typical depths of head and neck treatments",

abstract="PURPOSE: To assess the accuracy of maximum-intensity volumes (MIV) for fast contouring of lung tumors including respiratory motion. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) data of 10 patients were acquired. Maximum-intensity volumes were constructed by assigning the maximum Hounsfield unit in all CT volumes per geometric voxel to a new, synthetic volume. Gross tumor volumes (GTVs) were contoured on all CT volumes, and their union was constructed. The GTV with all its respiratory motion was contoured on the MIV as well. Union GTVs and GTVs including motion were compared visually. Furthermore, planning target volumes (PTVs) were constructed for the union of GTVs and the GTV on MIV. These PTVs were compared by centroid position, volume, geometric extent, and surface distance. RESULTS: Visual comparison of GTVs demonstrated failure of the MIV technique for 5 of 10 patients. For adequate GTV(MIV)s, differences between PTVs were <1.0 mm in centroid position, 5\% in volume, +/-5 mm in geometric extent, and +/-0.5 +/- 2.0 mm in surface distance. These values represent the uncertainties for successful MIV contouring. CONCLUSION: Maximum-intensity volumes are a good first estimate for target volume definition including respiratory motion. However, it seems mandatory to validate each individual MIV by overlaying it on a movie loop displaying the 4DCT data and editing it for possible inadequate coverage of GTVs on additional 4DCT motion states",

abstract="Clinical outcomes of charged particle therapy are very promising. Currently, several dedicated centers that use scanning beam technology are either close to clinical use or under construction. Since scanned beam treatments of targets that move with respiration most likely result in marked local over- and underdosage due to interplay of target motion and dynamic beam application, dedicated motion mitigation techniques have to be employed. To date, the motion mitigation techniques, rescanning, beam gating, and beam tracking, have been proposed and tested in experimental studies. Rescanning relies on repeated irradiations of the target with the number of particles reduced accordingly per scan to statistically average local misdosage. Specific developments to prohibit temporal correlation between beam scanning and target motion will be required to guarantee adequate averaging. For beam gating, residual target motion within gating windows has to be mitigated in order to avoid local misdosage. Possibly the most promising strategy is to increase the overlap of adjacent particle pencil beams laterally as well as longitudinally to effectively reduce the sensitivity against small residual target motion. The most conformal and potentially most precise motion mitigation technique is beam tracking. Individual particle pencil beams have to be adapted laterally as well as longitudinally according to the target motion. Within the next several years, it can be anticipated that rescanning as well as beam gating will be ready for clinical use. For rescanning, treatment planning margins that incorporate the full extent of target motion as well as motion induced density variations in the beam paths will result in reduced target conformity of the applied dose distributions. Due to the limited precision of motion monitoring devices, it seems likely that beam gating will be used initially to mitigate interplay effects only but not to considerably decrease treatment planning margins. Then, in the next step, beam gating, based on more accurate motion monitoring systems, provides the possibility to restore target conformity as well as steep dose gradients due to reduced treatment planning margins. Accurate motion monitoring systems will be required for beam tracking. Even though beam tracking has already been successfully tested experimentally, full clinical implementation requires direct feedback of the actual target position in quasireal time to the treatment control system and can be anticipated to be several more years ahead",

abstract="PURPOSE: To develop and evaluate a correction strategy for prostate rotation using gantry and collimator angle adjustments. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Gantry and collimator angle adjustments were used to correct for prostate rotation without rotating the table. A formula to partially correct for left-right (LR) rotations was derived through geometric analysis of rotation-induced clinical target volume (CTV) beam's-eye-view shape changes. For 10 prostate patients, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plans with different margins were created. Simulating CTV LR rotation and correcting each beam by a collimator rotation, the corrected CTV dose was compared with the original and uncorrected dose. Effects of residual geometric uncertainties were assessed using a Monte Carlo technique. A large number of treatments representative for prostate patients were simulated. Dose probability histograms of the minimum CTV dose (D min) were derived, with and without online correction, resulting in a more realistic margin estimate. RESULTS: Dosimetric analysis of all IMRT plans showed that, with rotational correction and a 2-mm margin, D min was constant to within 3\% for LR rotations up to +/-15 degrees . The Monte Carlo dose probability histograms showed that, with correction, a margin of 4 mm ensured that 90\% of patients received a D min >or=95\% of the prescribed dose. Without correction a margin of 6 mm was required. CONCLUSIONS: We developed and tested a practical method for (online) correction of prostate rotation, allowing safe and straightforward implementation of margin reduction and dose escalation",

abstract="PURPOSE: To quantify and evaluate the accumulated prostate, rectum, and bladder dose for several strategies including rotational organ motion correction for intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) of prostate cancer using realistic organ motion data. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Repeat computed tomography (CT) scans of 19 prostate patients were used. Per patient, two IMRT plans with different uniform margins were created. To quantify prostate and seminal vesicle motion, repeat CT clinical target volumes (CTVs) were matched onto the planning CTV using deformable registration. Four different strategies, from online setup to full motion correction, were simulated. Rotations were corrected for using gantry and collimator angle adjustments. Prostate, rectum, and bladder doses were accumulated for each patient, plan, and strategy. Minimum CTV dose (D(min)), rectum equivalent uniform dose (EUD, n = 0.13), and bladder surface receiving >or=78 Gy (S78), were calculated. RESULTS: With online CTV translation correction, a 7-mm margin was sufficient (i.e., D(min) >or= 95\% of the prescribed dose for all patients). A 4-mm margin required additional rotational correction. Margin reduction lowered the rectum EUD(n = 0.13) by approximately 2.6 Gy, and the bladder S78 by approximately 1.9\%. CONCLUSIONS: With online correction of both translations and rotations, a 4-mm margin was sufficient for 15 of 19 patients, whereas the remaining four patients had an underdosed CTV volume <1\%. Margin reduction combined with online corrections resulted in a similar or lower dose to the rectum and bladder. The more advanced the correction strategy, the better the planned and accumulated dose agreed",

abstract="At particle therapy facilities with pencil beam scanning, the implementation of a ripple filter (RiFi) broadens the Bragg peak (BP), which leads to fewer energy steps from the accelerator required to obtain an homogeneous dose coverage of the planned target volume (PTV). At the Universitatsklinikum Giessen und Marburg, Germany, a new second generation RiFi has been developed with two-dimensional groove structures. In this work we evaluate this new RiFi design. METHODS: The Monte Carlo (MC) code SHIELD-HIT12A is used to determine the RiFi-induced inhomogeneities in the dose distribution for various ion types, initial particle energies and distances from the RiFi to the phantom surface as well as in the depth of the phantom. The beam delivery and monitor system (BAMS) used at Marburg, the Heidelberg Ionentherapiezentrum (HIT), Universitatsklinikum Heidelberg, Germany and the GSI Helmholtzzentrum fur Schwerionenforschung, Darmstadt, Germany is modeled and simulated. To evaluate the PTV dose coverage performance of the new RiFi design, the heavy ion treatment planning system TRiP98 is used for dose optimization. SHIELD-HIT12A is used to prepare the facility-specific physical dose kernels needed by TRiP, and for recalculating the physical dose distribution after TRiP optimization. RESULTS: At short distances from the RiFi to the phantom surface fine structures in the dose distribution are observed. For various RiFis, ion types and initial particle energies the distance dmax at which maximum dose inhomogeneity occurs is found and an expression for dmax is deduced. The distance d0.01 at which the dose inhomogeneity is less than 1\% is estimated and used as a threshold distance at which dose distributions are considered homogeneous. The MC data are found to agree with analytical expressions for dmax and d0.01; both are inversely related to the angular distribution. Increasing scatter from the beam delivery and monitoring system results in reduced dmax and d0.01. Furthermore, dmax and d0.01 are found to be proportional to the RiFi period lambda. CONCLUSION: Our findings clearly indicate that the dose inhomogeneity induced by RiFis does not add uncertainties to the dose distribution in the clinical setting. The new RiFi design can be used in treatments to obtain homogeneous PTV dose coverage with fewer energy steps while improving lateral penumbra, thereby reducing the required treatment time",

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate a gating system, called predictive respiratory gating (PRG), that reduces motion-induced artifacts on computed tomographic (CT) scans of patients who cannot suspend respiration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PRG uses a respiration monitor and a new algorithm to predict when a motionless period is about to occur. It automatically starts scanning so the scan is temporally centered around the motionless period at end inspiration or end expiration. To demonstrate PRG, CT was performed on a motion phantom and a quietly breathing volunteer with and without gating. RESULTS: Scans of the phantom obtained with PRG contained less motion-induced streaking and blurring than did scans acquired without PRG. Scans of the volunteer gated at end expiration contained significantly less artifact than nongated scans (P < .03). CONCLUSION: PRG reduced motion artifact on scans of a spontaneously breathing volunteer. PRG may be able to reduce motion artifacts on scans of patients unable to suspend respiration",

abstract="PURPOSE: As an extension of previous studies, the time-course of high-LET-induced chromosomal damage was investigated in first- and second-cycle V79 Chinese hamster cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells were exposed in G1 to 10.4 MeV/u Ar ions (LET = 1226 keV/microm) and chromosomal damage was measured at 2h sampling intervals between 10 h and 34 h after irradiation. To distinguish between cells in different post-irradiation cycles, the fluorescence-plus-Giemsa technique was applied. RESULTS: For first- and second-generation cells, the number of aberrant metaphases and aberrations per metaphase were found to increase markedly with sampling time, demonstrating that cell cycle progression was delayed according to the number of lesions carried by the cell. To account for the time-dependent expression of chromosomal damage a mathematical approach was used based on the integrated flux of aberrant cells entering mitosis. Moreover, the analysis of Ar ion-induced chromosome lesions confirmed that high-LET radiation results in specific changes in the spectrum of aberration types. In particular, an increased rate of chromatid-type aberrations as well as a high frequency of chromosomal breaks was found, although the cells were exposed in G1. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the fact that cells collected at one sampling time are not representative of the entire population, the complete time-course of chromosomal damage has to be taken into account for the determination of a meaningful RBE value. Otherwise, the analysis of chromosomal damage can result in a pronounced over- or underestimation of the RBE depending on the subpopulation of cells entering mitosis at that particular sampling time",

abstract="INTRODUCTION: This multicentric in silico trial compares photon and proton radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer patients. The hypothesis is that proton radiotherapy decreases the dose and the volume of irradiated normal tissues even when escalating to the maximum tolerable dose of one or more of the organs at risk (OAR). METHODS: Twenty-five patients, stage IA-IIIB, were prospectively included. On 4D F18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography-computed tomography scans, the gross tumor, clinical and planning target volumes, and OAR were delineated. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) photon and passive scattered conformal proton therapy (PSPT) plans were created to give 70 Gy to the tumor in 35 fractions. Dose (de-)escalation was performed by rescaling to the maximum tolerable dose. RESULTS: Protons resulted in the lowest dose to the OAR, while keeping the dose to the target at 70 Gy. The integral dose (ID) was higher for 3DCRT (59\%) and IMRT (43\%) than for PSPT. The mean lung dose reduced from 18.9 Gy for 3DCRT and 16.4 Gy for IMRT to 13.5 Gy for PSPT. For 10 patients, escalation to 87 Gy was possible for all 3 modalities. The mean lung dose and ID were 40 and 65\% higher for photons than for protons, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment planning results of the Radiation Oncology Collaborative Comparison trial show a reduction of ID and the dose to the OAR when treating with protons instead of photons, even with dose escalation. This shows that PSPT is able to give a high tumor dose, while keeping the OAR dose lower than with the photon modalities.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To document the size and location of the prostate, seminal vesicles, bladder, and rectum throughout the course of external beam radiotherapy. The frequency and range of motion of these organs are quantified. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients with localized carcinoma of the prostate had conventional simulation followed immediately by a treatment planning computed tomography scan (TPCT0). Once treatment was initiated, each patient had a weekly CT (TPCT1-N) before or after his daily treatment. Anatomical structures from CT were delineated on a computer workstation for analysis. The serial CT sets were spatially registered to the initial scan using image correlation software that brings into congruence the bony pelvis of the different scans. The location of the prostate, seminal vesicles, bladder, and rectum on subsequent scans were compared to TPCT0, as well as to each other. RESULTS: Prostate volumes were observed to vary by an average of +/- 10\% during the course of radiation therapy, while the seminal vesicle volumes varied by as much as 100\%. Bladder and rectal volumes varied by +/- 30\%. Compared to TPCT0, movement of the prostate was demonstrated in all patients. Quantitation of the center-of-mass (CM) showed motion of less than 1 mm in the left-right direction, while motion ranging from 0 to +/- 1 cm was observed in the anterior-posterior and superior-inferior directions. The individual standard deviations of these motions varied from approximately 1-5 mm. These variations were correlated to changes in the dimensions of the bladder and rectum. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the location of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and normal tissue volumes during the course of radiation therapy occur and have dosimetric consequences that may impact tumor control and normal tissue complication probabilities. Conformal therapy for prostate cancer will require the incorporation of knowledge of the anatomic relationships of these structures as a function of time. Therefore, these uncertainties must be taken into account when designing treatment plans and in considering dose escalation trials",

abstract="A photogrammetry system designed to reduce simulator-to-treatment and treatment-to-treatment patient positioning errors has been developed. Two complete systems have been installed in our department: one in the simulator room and one in a treatment room. Each system consists of three charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras; a ring of infrared LEDs around the lens of each camera; and several small, circular, retroreflective markers that are applied to the patient. The markers reflect infrared light directly back to the cameras, producing a binary image of oval hot spots when the image is thresholded. The three-dimensional position of each marker is calculated by conventional photogrammetry methods. At simulation, marker positions are measured, then transferred to the treatment room system. The system may be used to actively position patients, and to passively monitor a patient's position and motion during treatment. Studies have focused on measuring the system's temporal stability, precision, and accuracy; on optimal positioning of markers and cameras; and on assessing the system's capability to reduce the positioning error. The repeatability of measuring a marker's position is <0.1 mm in each orthogonal direction. The accuracy is approximately 0.5 mm over a 40 X 40 X 40 cm3 field of view. The system drift over four hours is approximately +/-0.2 mm. The photogrammetry system has been used to actively position a lead BB, embedded within a head phantom, at the isocenter; repeatability was +/-0.3 mm, as determined radiographically. The system has also been used to passively monitor the positioning of several head and neck patients that were set up by a therapist; setup errors of up to 10 mm in each orthogonal direction were measured, as well as the motion of the patient during treatment",

abstract="Purpose: Tumor control and normal tissue toxicity are strongly correlated to the tumor and normal tissue volumes receiving high prescribed dose levels in the course of radiotherapy. Planning target definition is, therefore, crucial to ensure favorable clinical outcomes. This is especially important for stereotactic body radiation therapy of lung cancers, characterized by high fractional doses and steep dose gradients. The shift in recent years from population-based to patient-specific treatment margins, as facilitated by the emergence of 4D medical imaging capabilities, is a major improvement. The commonly used motion-encompassing, or internal-target volume (ITV), target definition approach provides a high likelihood of coverage for the mobile tumor but inevitably exposes healthy tissue to high prescribed dose levels. The goal of this work was to generate an interpolated balanced planning target that takes into account both tumor coverage and normal tissue sparing from high prescribed dose levels, thereby improving on the ITV approach.Methods: For each 4DCT dataset, 4D deformable image registration was used to derive two bounding targets, namely, a 4D-intersection and a 4D-composite target which minimized normal tissue exposure to high prescribed dose levels and maximized tumor coverage, respectively. Through definition of an ``effective overlap volume histogram'' the authors derived an ``interpolated balanced planning target'' intended to balance normal tissue sparing from prescribed doses with tumor coverage. To demonstrate the dosimetric efficacy of the interpolated balanced planning target, the authors performed 4D treatment planning based on deformable image registration of 4D-CT data for five previously treated lung cancer patients. Two 4D plans were generated per patient, one based on the interpolated balanced planning target and the other based on the conventional ITV target. Plans were compared for tumor coverage and the degree of normal tissue sparing resulting from the new approach was quantified.Results: Analysis of the 4D dose distributions from all five patients showed that while achieving tumor coverage comparable to the ITV approach, the new planning target definition resulted in reductions of lung V(10), V(20), and V(30) of 6.3\% +/- 1.7\%, 10.6\% +/- 3.9\%, and 12.9\% +/- 5.5\%, respectively, as well as reductions in mean lung dose, mean dose to the GTV-ring and mean heart dose of 8.8\% +/- 2.5\%, 7.2\% +/- 2.5\%, and 10.6\% +/- 3.6\%, respectively.Conclusions: The authors have developed a simple and systematic approach to generate a 4D-interpolated balanced planning target volume that implicitly incorporates the dynamics of respiratory-organ motion without requiring 4D-dose computation or optimization. Preliminary results based on 4D-CT data of five previously treated lung patients showed that this new planning target approach may improve normal tissue sparing without sacrificing tumor coverage",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Proton therapy of lung cancer holds the potential for a reduction of the volume of irradiated normal lung tissue. In this work we investigate the robustness of intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) plans to motion, and evaluate a geometrical tumour tracking method to compensate for tumour motion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seven patients with a nine targets with 4DCT scans were selected. IMPT plans were made on the midventilation phase using a 3-field technique. The plans were transferred and calculated on the remaining nine phases of the 4DCT, and the combined dose distribution was summed using deformable image registration (DIR). An additional set of plans were made in which the proton beam was simply geometrically shifted to the centre of the gross tumour volume (GTV), i.e. simulating tracking of the tumour motion but without on-line adjustment of the proton energies. A possible interplay effect between the dynamics of the spot scanning delivery and the tumour motion has not been considered in this work. RESULTS: Around 97-100\% of the GTV was covered by 95\% of the prescribed dose (V95) for a tumour displacement of less than about 1 cm with a static beam. For the remaining three of nine targets with a larger motion the tracking method studied provided a marked improvement over static beam; raising the GTV V95 from 95 to 100\%, 82 to 98\% and 51 to 97\%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The possibility of performing DIR and summing the dose on the 4DCT data set was shown to be feasible. The fairly simplistic tracking method suggested here resulted in a marked improvement in GTV coverage for tumours with large intra-fractional motion (>1 cm displacement), indicating that on-line adjustment of the proton energies may be redundant",

abstract="Purpose: Conventional radiotherapeutic techniques are associated with lung toxicity that limits the treatment dose. Motion of the tumor during treatment requires the use of large safety margins that affect the feasibility of treatment. To address the control of tumor motion and decrease the volume of normal lung irradiated, we investigated the use of three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) in conjunction with the deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) technique.Methods and Materials: In the DIBH technique, the patient is initially maintained at quiet tidal breathing, followed by a deep inspiration, a deep expiration, a second deep inspiration, and breath-hold. At this point the patient is at approximately 100\% vital capacity, and simulation, verification, and treatment take place during this phase of breath-holding.Results: Seven patients have received a total of 164 treatment sessions and have tolerated the technique well. The estimated normal tissue complication probabilities decreased in all patients at their prescribed dose when compared to free breathing. The dose to which patients could be treated with DIBH increased on average from 69.4 Gy to 87.9 Gy, without increasing the risk of toxicityConclusions: The DIBH technique provides an advantage to conventional free-breathing treatment by decreasing lung density, reducing normal safety margins, and enabling more accurate treatment. These improvements contribute to the effective exclusion of normal lung tissue from the high-dose region and permit the use of higher treatment doses without increased risks of toxicity",

abstract="Accurate real-time prediction of respiratory motion is desirable for effective motion management in radiotherapy for lung tumor targets. Recently, nonparametric methods have been developed and their efficacy in predicting one-dimensional respiratory-type motion has been demonstrated. To exploit the correlation among various coordinates of the moving target, it is natural to extend the 1D method to multidimensional processing. However, the amount of learning data required for such extension grows exponentially with the dimensionality of the problem, a phenomenon known as the 'curse of dimensionality'. In this study, we investigate a multidimensional prediction scheme based on kernel density estimation (KDE) in an augmented covariate-response space. To alleviate the 'curse of dimensionality', we explore the intrinsic lower dimensional manifold structure and utilize principal component analysis (PCA) to construct a proper low-dimensional feature space, where kernel density estimation is feasible with the limited training data. Interestingly, the construction of this lower dimensional representation reveals a useful decomposition of the variations in respiratory motion into the contribution from semiperiodic dynamics and that from the random noise, as it is only sensible to perform prediction with respect to the former. The dimension reduction idea proposed in this work is closely related to feature extraction used in machine learning, particularly support vector machines. This work points out a pathway in processing high-dimensional data with limited training instances, and this principle applies well beyond the problem of target-coordinate-based respiratory-based prediction. A natural extension is prediction based on image intensity directly, which we will investigate in the continuation of this work. We used 159 lung target motion traces obtained with a Synchrony respiratory tracking system. Prediction performance of the low-dimensional feature learning-based multidimensional prediction method was compared against the independent prediction method where prediction was conducted along each physical coordinate independently. Under fair setup conditions, the proposed method showed uniformly better performance, and reduced the case-wise 3D root mean squared prediction error by about 30-40\%. The 90\% percentile 3D error is reduced from 1.80 mm to 1.08 mm for 160 ms prediction, and 2.76 mm to 2.01 mm for 570 ms prediction. The proposed method demonstrates the most noticeable improvement in the tail of the error distribution",

abstract="BACKGROUND: The application of spacer gel represents a promising approach to reliably spare the rectal frontal wall during particle therapy (IJROBP 76:1251-1258, 2010). In order to qualify the spacer gel for the clinical use in particle therapy, a variety of measurements were performed in order to ensure the biological compatibility of the gel, its physical stability during and after the irradiation, and a proper definition of the gel in terms of the Hounsfield Unit (HU) values for the treatment planning system. The potential for the use of the spacer gel for particle therapy monitoring with off-line Positron Emission Tomography (PET) was also investigated. RESULTS: The spacer gel implanted to the prostate patient in direct neighbourhood to the clinical target volume does not interfere with the particle therapy treatment planning procedure applied at Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Centre (HIT). The performed measurements show that Bragg-peak position of the particles can be properly predicted on the basis of computed tomography imaging with the treatment planning system used at HIT (measured water equivalent path length of 1.011 +/-0.011 (2sigma), measured Hounsfield Unit of 28.9 +/-6.1 (2sigma)). The spacer gel samples remain physically unchanged after irradiation with a dose exceeding the therapeutic dose level. The independently measured Bragg-Peak position does not change within the time interval of 10 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the presented experiments, the first clinical application of spacer gel implant during prostate cancer treatment with carbon ions and protons was possible at HIT in 2012. The reported pre-clinical investigations demonstrate that use of spacer gel is safe in particle therapy in presence of therapy target motion and patient positioning induced particle range variations. The spacer gel injected between prostate and rectum enlarge the distance between both organs, which is expected to clinically significantly decrease the undesirable exposure of the most critical organ at risk, i.e. rectal frontal wall. Further research on the composition of spacer gel material might lead to additional clinical benefits by validation of particle therapy of prostate via post-therapeutic PET-imaging or by patient positioning based on the gel as a radio-opaque marker",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Ion beam therapy represents a promising approach to treat prostate cancer, mainly due to its high conformity and radiobiological effectiveness. However, the presence of prostate motion, patient positioning and range uncertainties may deteriorate target dose and increase exposure of organs at risk. Spacer gel injected between prostate and rectum may increase the safety of prostate cancer (PC) radiation therapy by separating the rectum from the target dose field. The dosimetric impact of the application of spacer gel for scanned carbon ion therapy of PC has been analyzed at Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center (HIT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The robustness of ion therapy treatment plans was investigated by comparison of two data sets of patients treated with and without spacer gel. A research treatment planning system for ion therapy was used for treatment plan optimization and calculation of daily dose distributions on 2 to 9 Computed Tomography (CT) studies available for each of the 19 patients. Planning and daily dose distributions were analyzed with respect to target coverage, maximal dose to the rectum (excluding 1 ml of the greatest dose; Dmax-1 ml) and the rectal volume receiving dose greater than 90\% of prescribed target dose (V90Rectum), respectively. RESULTS: The application of spacer gel did substantially diminish rectum dose. Dmax-1 ml on the treatment planning CT was on average reduced from 100.0 +/- 1.0\% to 90.2 +/- 4.8\%, when spacer gel was applied. The robustness analysis performed with daily CT studies demonstrated for all analyzed patient cases that application of spacer gel results in a decrease of the daily V90Rectum index, which calculated over all patient cases and CT studies was 10.2 +/- 10.4 [ml] and 1.1 +/- 2.1 [ml] for patients without and with spacer gel, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The dosimetric benefit of increasing the distance between prostate and rectum using spacer gel for PC treatment with carbon ion beams has been quantified. Application of spacer gel substantially reduced rectal exposure to high treatment dose and, therefore, can reduce the hazard of rectal toxicity in ion beam therapy of PC. The results of this study enable modifications of the PC ion therapy protocol such as dose escalation or hypofractionation",

abstract="PURPOSE: To measure the patient positioning and prostate motion variability and to estimate its influence on the calculated 3D dose distribution in 3D conformal radiotherapy of patients with localized prostate carcinoma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patient positioning variability was determined retrospectively by comparing 54 orthogonal simulator films with 125 corresponding portal films from 27 patients. Prostate motion variability was determined by 107 computed tomography (CT) examinations with a CT simulator in 28 patients during radiotherapy. RESULTS: In each observed direction, the patient positioning variability and prostate motion showed a normal distribution. This observation enabled the calculation of a combined error of both components. The standard deviation (1 SD) of the patient positioning error in three directions ranged from 3.1 to 5.4 mm; the prostate motion variability was significantly greater in the anterior-posterior direction (1 SD = 2.8 mm) than in the mediolateral direction (1 SD = 1.4 mm). The 1 SD of the estimated combined error was in the anterior-posterior direction 6.1 mm and in mediolateral direction 3.6 mm. CONCLUSION: The range of patient positioning variability and prostate motion were statistically predictable under the patient setup conditions used. Dose-volume histograms demonstrating the influence of the combined error of both components on the calculated dose distribution are presented",

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate the use of postoperative proton therapy (PT) in extracranial chordoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients were treated. Gross total resection was achieved in 18 patients. Nine patients had cervical, 2 had thoracic, 8 had lumbar, and 7 had sacro-coccygeal chordomas. Thirteen patients had implants. PT was administered after function-preserving surgery, using a gantry and spot scanning, without or with intensity modulation (IMPT; 6 patients), and/or photon-based radiotherapy (RT, 6 patients). Median total dose was 72 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE; range, 59.4-74.4), with means of 70.5 and 73.2 CGE for patients with and without implants. Median follow-up time was 35 months (range, 13-73 months). Adverse events were scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grading system (version 3.0). RESULTS: At 3 years, actuarial overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 84\% and 77\%, respectively. One patient each died of local failure (LF), distant failure (DF), suicide, and secondary tumor. We observed 5 LFs and 3 DFs; 3-year LF-free and DF-free survival rates were 86\%. We observed four radiation-induced late adverse events (Grade 2 sensory neuropathy; Grade 3 subcutaneous necrosis, and osteonecrosis; and Grade 5 secondary cancer). In univariate analysis, implants were associated with LF (p = 0.034). Gross residual tumor above 30 mL was negatively associated with OS (p = 0.013) and PFS (p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative PT for extracranial chordomas delivered with spot scanning offers high local control rates. Toxicity was acceptable. Implants were significantly associated with LF. Residual tumor above 30 mL impacted negatively on OS and PFS",

abstract="In this report we present the technical features of Gantry 2, the new second generation scanning system of PSI. On the basis of the experience and success with the first prototype, Gantry 1, built in the 90s for introducing pencil beam scanning and IMPT into the field of proton therapy, we have recently implemented a new system capable of offering much faster repainted conformal scanning for being able to treat moving targets with scanning under image guidance, the next challenge in the field of proton therapy. The new technical developments are conducted in parallel to the ongoing basic commissioning of Gantry 2, which should go into operation with usual discrete spot scanning for treating static targets in 2013. The innovative layout of Gantry 2 and the integration in the treatment area of the basic equipment for image guidance are presented. Noteworthy are the sliding CT within reach of the patient table and the unique new Beam{\^a}??s-Eye-View X-ray fluoroscopy system for taking images in the beam direction synchronized with the proton beam delivery. The first preliminary results with the development of much faster scanning modes look very encouraging. We can change the beam energy with the beam line within 80 ms for typical 0.5 cm range steps. We can deliver whole fluence-shaped energy layers within a time of the order of 100 ms. Dose lines are painted by changing the velocity of the scan magnets. The instantaneous dose rate of the pencil beam can be varied dynamically as well. The dose is precisely controlled with a feedback loop connecting the main gantry beam monitor with a vertical deflector plate at the ion source. These new fast scanning modes should be used for providing scanning with repainting, gating and tracking for treating moving targets. The goal is to develop pencil beam scanning as a universal beam delivery solution capable of treating optimally all possible clinical indications for proton therapy. Scanning could then completely replace the old beam delivery methods based on passive scattering from the market. The long term projects of Gantry 2 should represent the new contributions of PSI to the proton therapy field in the next 5-10 years, by providing direct translational cancer research from the physics laboratory into industry and clinics",

abstract="The technical performance of an integrated three-dimensional carbon ion pencil beam tracking system that was developed at GSI was investigated in phantom studies. Aim of the beam tracking system is to accurately treat tumours that are subject to respiratory motion with scanned ion beams. The current system provides real-time control of ion pencil beams to track a moving target laterally using the scanning magnets and longitudinally with a dedicated range shifter. The system response time was deduced to be approximately 1 ms for lateral beam tracking. The range shifter response time has been measured for various range shift amounts. A value of 16 ? 2 ms was achieved for a water equivalent shift of 5 mm. An additional communication delay of 11 ? 2 ms was taken into account in the beam tracking process via motion prediction. Accuracy of the lateral beam tracking was measured with a multi-wire position detector to 0.16 mm standard deviation. Longitudinal beam tracking accuracy was parameterized based on measured responses of the range shifter and required time durations to maintain a specific particle range. For example, 5 mm water equivalence (WE) longitudinal beam tracking results in accuracy of 1.08 and 0.48 mm WE in root mean square for time windows of 10 and 50 ms, respectively.",

abstract="DNA damage is a relatively common event in the life of a cell and may lead to mutation, cancer, and cellular or organismic death. Damage to DNA induces several cellular responses that enable the cell either to eliminate or cope with the damage or to activate a programmed cell death process, presumably to eliminate cells with potentially catastrophic mutations. These DNA damage response reactions include: (a) removal of DNA damage and restoration of the continuity of the DNA duplex; (b) activation of a DNA damage checkpoint, which arrests cell cycle progression so as to allow for repair and prevention of the transmission of damaged or incompletely replicated chromosomes; (c) transcriptional response, which causes changes in the transcription profile that may be beneficial to the cell; and (d) apoptosis, which eliminates heavily damaged or seriously deregulated cells. DNA repair mechanisms include direct repair, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, double-strand break repair, and cross-link repair. The DNA damage checkpoints employ damage sensor proteins, such as ATM, ATR, the Rad17-RFC complex, and the 9-1-1 complex, to detect DNA damage and to initiate signal transduction cascades that employ Chk1 and Chk2 Ser/Thr kinases and Cdc25 phosphatases. The signal transducers activate p53 and inactivate cyclin-dependent kinases to inhibit cell cycle progression from G1 to S (the G1/S checkpoint), DNA replication (the intra-S checkpoint), or G2 to mitosis (the G2/M checkpoint). In this review the molecular mechanisms of DNA repair and the DNA damage checkpoints in mammalian cells are analyzed",

abstract="In this paper, we present a real-time simulation and visualization framework that models a deformable surface lung model with tumor, simulates the tumor motion and predicts the amount of radiation doses that would be deposited in the moving lung tumor during the actual delivery of radiation. The model takes as input a subject-specific 4D Computed Tomography (4D CT) of lungs and computes a deformable lung surface model by estimating the deformation properties of the surface model using an inverse dynamics approach. Once computed, the deformable model is used to simulate and visualize lung tumor motion that would occur during radiation therapy accounting for variations in the breathing pattern. A radiation treatment plan for the lung tumor is developed using one of the 4D CT phases. During the simulation of radiation delivery, the dose on the lung tumor is computed for each beam independently",

abstract="PURPOSE: Assuming that early tumor volume change is a biomarker for response to therapy, accurate quantification of early volume changes could aid in adapting an individual patient's therapy and lead to shorter clinical trials. We investigated an image registration-based approach for tumor volume change quantification that may more reliably detect smaller changes that occur in shorter intervals than can be detected by existing algorithms. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Variance and bias of the registration-based approach were evaluated using retrospective, in vivo, very-short-interval diffusion magnetic resonance imaging scans where true zero tumor volume change is unequivocally known and synthetic data, respectively. The interval scans were nonlinearly registered using two similarity measures: mutual information (MI) and normalized cross-correlation (NCC). RESULTS: The 95\% confidence interval of the percentage volume change error was (-8.93\% to 10.49\%) for MI-based and (-7.69\%, 8.83\%) for NCC-based registrations. Linear mixed-effects models demonstrated that error in measuring volume change increased with increase in tumor volume and decreased with the increase in the tumor's normalized mutual information, even when NCC was the similarity measure being optimized during registration. The 95\% confidence interval of the relative volume change error for the synthetic examinations with known changes over +/-80\% of reference tumor volume was (-3.02\% to 3.86\%). Statistically significant bias was not demonstrated. CONCLUSION: A low-noise, low-bias tumor volume change measurement algorithm using nonlinear registration is described. Errors in change measurement were a function of tumor volume and the normalized mutual information content of the tumor",

Patients left the room between breath-hold scans. The patient?s breath was held at the same predefined phase of the breathing cycle (about 70\% of the vital capacity) using the ABC device, then patients received 3D-conformal radiotherapy. Automated computerized tools for breath-hold CT scans were developed to analyze lung and tumor interfraction residual motions with 3D nonrigid registration.ResultsAll patients but one were safely treated with ABC for 7 weeks. For 6 patients, the lung volume differences were 300 cm3 and displacements >10 mm, probably owing to atelectasia and emphysema. One patient was excluded, and two others had incomplete data sets.ConclusionBreath-holding with ABC was effective in 6 patients, and discrepancies were clinically accountable in 2.

abstract="Ths paper examines several applications of deformable registration algorithms in the field of image-guided radiotherapy. The first part focuses on the description of input and output of deformable registration algorithms, with a brief review of conventional and most current methods. The typical applications of deformable registration are then reviewed on the basis of four practical examples. The first two sets of examples deal with the fusion of images obtained from the same patient (inter-fraction registration), with time intervals of several days between each image. The other two examples deal with the fusion of images obtained in immediate sequence (intra-fraction registration); in this case, the focus is the displacement during image acquisition or patient treatment (mainly due to respiratory movement), with time intervals in the order of magnitude of tenths of seconds. Finally, the registration of images of different patients (inter-patient registration) is also discussed. In conclusion, deformable registration has become a fundamental tool for image analysis in radiotherapy. Although extensive validation of the numerous existing methods is required before extending its clinical use, deformable registration is expected to become a standard methodology in the treatment planning systems in the near future",

abstract="Summary Radical radiotherapy, the mainstay of treatment for early inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer, is most commonly given in daily fractions, Monday to Friday, to a total dose of 60-70 Gy over 6-8 weeks. Since the 1980s, novel fractionation schedules have been explored with the aim of improving local tumour control and survival without increasing late morbidity. There have been two main approaches. In hyperfractionated radiotherapy the dose per fraction is reduced and the total dose increased to give improved tumour control without increased late morbidity. Hyperfractionation schedules, with more than one fraction per day have been successfully evaluated, but so far significant benefit has not been achieved when compared with conventional radiotherapy plus chemotherapy. In accelerated radiotherapy the overall duration of radiotherapy is reduced to overcome repopulation of tumour cells during the course of treatment. In all the different regimens of accelerated radiotherapy a common feature is giving two or more fractions on some or all treatment days and, in some cases, a lower dose per fraction is also incorporated. CHART (continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy) is the most novel and accelerated schedule tested, and a randomised controlled trial showed a significant survival advantage from CHART compared with conventional radiotherapy. Changes in the fractionation of radiotherapy must be combined with other approaches such as neoadjuvant and concomitant chemotherapy, hypoxic-cell modifiers, and conformal radiotherapy, so that care of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer can be further advanced",

abstract="SummaryBackground Human tumour cells can proliferate rapidly, and giving radiotherapy in many small fractions may reduce long-term normal-tissue morbidity. In response to these observations, we developed the CHART (continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy) regimen, which uses thirty-six small fractions of 1[middle dot]5 Gy given three times per day, to give 54 Gy in only 12 consecutive days. We report the long-term follow-up of a trial of CHART versus conventional radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods 563 patients were entered by thirteen centres between April, 1990, and March, 1995. We included patients with NSCLC localised to the chest with a performance status of 0 or 1 in whom radical radiotherapy was chosen as the definitive management. Patients were randomly allocated in a 3:2 ratio to CHART or conventional radiotherapy. The latter was thirty fractions of 2 Gy to a total dose of 60 Gy in 6 weeks.Results The groups were well matched for possible prognostic factors. Overall there was a 24\% reduction in the relative risk of death, which is equivalent to an absolute improvement in 2-year survival of 9\% from 20\% to 29\% (p=0[middle dot]004, 95\% CI 0[middle dot]63-0[middle dot]92). Subgroup analyses (predefined) suggest that the largest benefit occurred in patients with squamous cell carcinomas (82\% of the cases), in whom there was a 34\% reduction in the relative risk of death (an absolute improvement at 2 years of 14\% from 19\% to 33\%). During the first 3 months, severe dysphagia occurred more often in the CHART group than in the group on conventional radiotherapy (19 vs 3\%). Otherwise, there were no important differences in short-term or long-term morbidity.Interpretation CHART compared with conventional radiotherapy gave a significant improvement in survival of patients with NSCLC. Further improvement may be achieved with dose escalation in conformal radiotherapy, by the addition of cytotoxic chemotherapy, and by hypoxic cell radiosensitisation",

abstract="Background and method: A randomised controlled trial in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), compared CHART which employs 36 fractions of 1.5 Gy 3 times per day to give 54 Gy in 12 consecutive days with conventional radiotherapy-30 fractions of 2 Gy to a total dose of 60 Gy in 6 weeks. A total of 563 patients were entered between April 1990 and April 1995. This report is based upon the data updated to 1 April 1998. Results: The analysis of the mature data shows that the benefits previously reported have been maintained. Overall there was a 22\% reduction in the relative risk of death, which is equivalent to an absolute improvement in 2 year survival of 9\% from 20 to 29\% (P=0.008) and a 21\% reduction in the relative risk of local progression (P=0.033). In the large subgroup of patients with squamous cell cancer which accounted for 81\% of the cases, there was a 30\% reduction in the relative risk of death, which is equivalent to an absolute improvement in 2 year survival of 13\% from 20 to 33\% (P=0.0007) and a 27\% reduction in the relative risk of local progression (P=0.012). Furthermore, in squamous carcinoma there was a 25\% reduction in the relative risk of local and/or distant progression (P=0.025) and 24\% reduction in the relative risk of metastasis (P=0.043). There was no evidence that CHART gave more or less benefit in any other subgroup. Conclusion: This analysis of mature data confirms that CHART is superior to conventional radiotherapy in achieving local tumour control and survival in locally advanced NSCLC. This demonstrates the importance of cellular repopulation as a cause of failure in the radiotherapy of NSCLC. The reduction in the risk of metastasis confirms that improved local tumour control, even in lung cancer, can reduce the incidence of metastasis. This trial shows that control of local tumour can lead to an improvement in long term survival",

abstract="Tumor tracking using a dynamic multileaf collimator (DMLC) represents a promising approach for intrafraction motion management in thoracic and abdominal cancer radiotherapy. In this work, we develop, empirically demonstrate, and characterize a novel 3D tracking algorithm for real-time, conformal, intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)-based radiation delivery to targets moving in three dimensions. The algorithm obtains real-time information of target location from an independent position monitoring system and dynamically calculates MLC leaf positions to account for changes in target position. Initial studies were performed to evaluate the geometric accuracy of DMLC tracking of 3D target motion. In addition, dosimetric studies were performed on a clinical linac to evaluate the impact of real-time DMLC tracking for conformal, step-and-shoot (S-IMRT), dynamic (D-IMRT), and VMAT deliveries to a moving target. The efficiency of conformal and IMRT delivery in the presence of tracking was determined. Results show that submillimeter geometric accuracy in all three dimensions is achievable with DMLC tracking. Significant dosimetric improvements were observed in the presence of tracking for conformal and IMRT deliveries to moving targets. A gamma index evaluation with a 3\%-3 mm criterion showed that deliveries without DMLC tracking exhibit between 1.7 (S-IMRT) and 4.8 (D-IMRT) times more dose points that fail the evaluation compared to corresponding deliveries with tracking. The efficiency of IMRT delivery, as measured in the lab, was observed to be significantly lower in case of tracking target motion perpendicular to MLC leaf travel compared to motion parallel to leaf travel. Nevertheless, these early results indicate that accurate, real-time DMLC tracking of 3D tumor motion is feasible and can potentially result in significant geometric and dosimetric advantages leading to more effective management of intrafraction motion",

abstract="Efforts have been made to extend the application of intensity-modulated radiotherapy to a variety of organs. One of the unanswered questions is whether breathing-induced organ motion may lead to a relevant over- or underdosage, e.g., in treatment plans for the irradiation of lung cancer. Theoretical considerations have been made concerning the different kinds of IMRT but there is still a lack of experimental data. We examined 18 points in a fraction of a clinical treatment plan of a NSCLC delivered in static IMRT with a new phantom and nine ionization chambers. Measurements were performed at a speed of 12 and 16 breathing cycles per minute. The dose differences between static points and moving target points ranged between \&minus;2.4\% and +5.5\% (mean: +0.2\%, median: \&minus;0.1\%) when moving with 12 cycles min\$^\&minus;1\$ and between \&minus;3.6\% and +5.0\% (mean: \&minus;0.4\%, median: \&minus;0.6\%) when moving with 16 cycles min\$^\&minus;1\$. All differences of measurements with and without movements were below 5\%, with one exception. In conclusion, our results underline that at least in static IMRT breathing effects (concerning target dose coverage) due to interplay effects between collimator leaf movement and target movement are of secondary importance and will not reduce the clinical value of IMRT in the step-and-shoot technique for irradiation of thoracic targets",

abstract="The gantry for proton radiotherapy at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) is designed specifically for the spot-scanning technique. Use of this technique to its full potential requires dose calculation algorithms which are capable of precisely simulating each scanned beam individually. Different specialized analytical dose calculations have been developed, which attempt to model the effects of density heterogeneities in the patient?s body on the dose. Their accuracy has been evaluated by a comparison with Monte Carlo calculated dose distributions in the case of a simple geometrical density interface parallel to the beam and typical anatomical situations. A specialized ray casting model which takes range dilution effects (broadening of the spectrum of proton ranges) into account has been found to produce results of good accuracy. This algorithm can easily be implemented in the iterative optimization procedure used for the calculation of the optimal contribution of each individual scanned pencil beam. In most cases an elemental pencil beam dose calculation has been found to be most accurate. Due to the long computing time, this model is currently used only after the optimization procedure as an alternative method of calculating the dose",

abstract="As a part of the physical-technical program of the heavy-ion therapy project at GSI we have investigated the nuclear fragmentation of high-energy ion beams delivered by the heavy-ion synchrotron SIS, using water as a tissue-equivalent target. For a direct comparison of fragmentation properties, beams of 10B, 12C, 14N, and 16O were produced simultaneously as secondary beams from a primary 18O beam and separated in flight by magnetic beam analysis. The Z-distributions of beam fragments produced in the water target were measured via energy loss in a large ionisation chamber and a scintillator telescope. From these data we obtained both total and partial charge-changing cross sections. In addition we have performed Bragg measurements using two parallel-plate ionization chambers and a water target of variable length. The detailed shape of the measured Bragg curves and the measured cross sections are in good agreement with model calculations based on semi-empirical formulae",

abstract="OBJECTIVE: Treatment of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in coronary heart disease has to date been limited to palliative treatment with drugs or implantable defibrillators. The results of curative treatment with catheter ablation have proved disappointing because the complexity of the VT mechanism makes identification of the substrate using conventional mapping techniques difficult. The use of a mapping technology that may address some of these issues, and thus make possible a cure for VT with catheter ablation, is reported. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: The non-contact system, consisting of a multielectrode array catheter (MEA) and a computer mapping system, was used to map VT in 24 patients. Twenty two patients had structural heart disease, the remainder having ``normal'' left ventricles with either fasicular tachycardia or left ventricular ectopic tachycardia. RESULTS: Exit sites were demonstrated in 80 of 81 VT morphologies by the non-contact system, and complete VT circuits were traced in 17. In another 37 morphologies of VT 36 (30)\% (mean (SD)) of the diastolic interval was identified. Thirty eight VT morphologies were ablated using 154 radiofrequency energy applications. Successful ablation was achieved by 77\% of radiofrequency within diastolic activation identified by the non-contact system and was significantly more likely to ablate VT than radiofrequency at the VT exit, or remote from diastolic activation. Over a mean follow up of 1.5 years, 14 patients have had no recurrence of VT and only two target VTs have recurred. Five patients have had recurrence of either slower non-sustained, undocumented or fast non-target VT. Five patients have died, one from tamponade from a pre-existing temporary pacing wire, and four from causes unrelated to the procedure. CONCLUSION: The non-contact system can safely be used to map and ablate haemodynamically stable VT with low VT recurrence rates. It is yet to be established whether this system may be applied with equal success to patients with haemodynamically unstable VT",

Conformal precision radiotherapy is planned with a new three-dimensional treatment planning system (Voxel-Plan-Heidelberg) which comprises, among others options, a three-dimensional image correlation procedure as well as routines for the calculation of coplanar and non-coplanar irradiations with irregularly shaped fields. Two different multi-leaf collimators have been designed for precision radiotherapy in the head and neck region. A manual multi-leaf collimator is used for irradiations with stationary beams or for moving beam treatments with invariable irregularly shaped fields. This collimator system is now being used for patient treatments. The design of a computer controlled multi-leaf collimator unit for multiple fixed field irradiation techniques is discussed. All system components are aimed at conforming dose distributions for fractionated radiotherapy treatments to the target to improve sparing of adjacent normal tissues, and at achieving a sufficient geometrical accuracy in the dose application",

abstract="Proton radiography is investigated for its use as a quality control tool in proton therapy. Images were produced both with range and range uncertainty information of protons passing through phantoms (Alderson phantom and a sheep's head). With the range images the correct positioning of the patient with respect to the beam could be verified. The range uncertainty images were used to quantitatively detect range variations of protons passing through inhomogeneities in the patient. These measurements can be used to indicate critical situations during proton therapy or to determine the safety margin around the tumor volume. With the range information the precision of different calibrations of computer tomography Hounsfield values to relative proton stopping power, used for proton treatment planning, was determined. It is found that the precision in range can be improved by a detailed analysis of the calibration data obtained from tissue-substitute measurements, by a factor of 2.5. The resulting range errors are in the order of the positioning precision (approximately 1 mm)",

abstract="Computer tomographic (CT) scans are used to correct for tissue inhomogeneities in radiotherapy treatment planning. In order to guarantee a precise treatment, it is important to obtain the relationship between CT Hounsfield units and electron densities (or proton stopping powers for proton radiotherapy), which is the basic input for radiotherapy planning systems which consider tissue heterogeneities. A method is described to determine improved CT calibrations for biological tissue (a stoichiometric calibration) based on measurements using tissue equivalent materials. The precision of this stoichiometric calibration and the more usual tissue substitute calibration is determined by a comparison of calculated proton radiographic images based on these calibrations and measured radiographs of a biological sample. It has been found that the stoichiometric calibration is more precise than the tissue substitute calibration",

Water equivalent tissue (WET) calibrated proton radiographs of a dog patient treated for a nasal tumor were used as baseline in comparison with integrated proton stopping power through the calibrated CT of the dog. In an optimization procedure starting with a stoichiometric calibration curve, the calibration was modified randomly. The result of this iteration is an optimized calibration curve which was used to recalculate the dose distribution of the patient. One result of this experiment was that the mean value of the deviations between WET calculations based on the stoichiometric calibration curve and the measurements was shifted systematically away from zero. The calibration produced by the optimization procedure reduced this shift to around 0.4 mm. Another result was that the precision of the calibration, reflected as the standard deviation of the normally distributed deviations between WET calculation and measurement, could be reduced from 7.9 to 6.7 mm with the optimized calibration. The dose distributions based on the two calibration curves showed major deviations at the distal end of the target volume",

abstract="A simplified method for the calculation of mammalian cell survival after charged particle irradiation is presented that is based on the track structure model of Scholz and Kraft [1, 2]. Utilizing a modified linear-quadratic relation for the x-ray survival curve, one finds that the model yields linear-quadratic relations also for heavy ion irradiation. If survival is calculated as a function of specific energy, z, in the cell nucleus--thus reducing the stochastic fluctuations of energy deposition--the increase in slope of the survival curve and therefore the coefficient beta z can be estimated with sufficient accuracy from the initial slope, alpha z. This permits the tabulation of the coefficients alpha z for the particle types and energies of interest, and subsequent fast calculations of survival levels at any point in a mixed particle beam. The complexity of the calculations can thereby be reduced in a wide range of applications, which permits the rapid calculations that are required for treatment planning in heavy ion therapy. The validity of the modified computations is assessed by the comparison with explicit calculations in terms of the original model and with experimental results for track-segment conditions. The model is then used to analyze the influence of beam fragmentation on the biological effect of charged particle beams penetrating to different depths in tissue. In addition, cell-survival rates after neuron irradiation are computed from the slowing-down spectra of secondary charged particles and are compared to experimental observations",

abstract="The physical and biological basis of our model to calculate the biological effects of charged particles, termed the local effect model (LEM), has recently been questioned in a commentary by R. Katz. Major objections were related to the definition of the target size and the use of the term cross section. Here we show that the objections raised against our approach are unjustified and are largely based on serious misunderstandings of the conceptual basis of the local effect model. Furthermore, we show that the approach developed by Katz and coworkers itself suffers from exactly those deficiencies for which Katz criticizes our model. The essential conceptual differences between the two models are discussed by means of some illustrative examples, based on a comparison with experimental data. For these examples, the predictions of the local effect model are fully consistent with the experimental data. In contrast, e.g. for very heavy ions, there are significant discrepancies observed for the Katz approach. These discrepancies can be attributed to the inadequate definition of the target size in this model. Experimental data are thus clearly in favor of the definition of the target as used in the local effect model. Agreement with experimental data is achieved for protons within the Katz approach but at the cost of questionable approximations in combination with the violation of the fundamental physical principle of energy conservation",

This steeper increase corresponds to an increasing RBE with increasing dose, which apparently is in contradiction to the systematics observed in general for in vitro measurements.

abstract="BACKGROUND: The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer was initiated in the early 1990s to evaluate the effect of screening with prostate-specific-antigen (PSA) testing on death rates from prostate cancer. METHODS: We identified 182,000 men between the ages of 50 and 74 years through registries in seven European countries for inclusion in our study. The men were randomly assigned to a group that was offered PSA screening at an average of once every 4 years or to a control group that did not receive such screening. The predefined core age group for this study included 162,243 men between the ages of 55 and 69 years. The primary outcome was the rate of death from prostate cancer. Mortality follow-up was identical for the two study groups and ended on December 31, 2006. RESULTS: In the screening group, 82\% of men accepted at least one offer of screening. During a median follow-up of 9 years, the cumulative incidence of prostate cancer was 8.2\% in the screening group and 4.8\% in the control group. The rate ratio for death from prostate cancer in the screening group, as compared with the control group, was 0.80 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.98; adjusted P=0.04). The absolute risk difference was 0.71 death per 1000 men. This means that 1410 men would need to be screened and 48 additional cases of prostate cancer would need to be treated to prevent one death from prostate cancer. The analysis of men who were actually screened during the first round (excluding subjects with noncompliance) provided a rate ratio for death from prostate cancer of 0.73 (95\% CI, 0.56 to 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: PSA-based screening reduced the rate of death from prostate cancer by 20\% but was associated with a high risk of overdiagnosis. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN49127736.)",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Tumor doses > 70 Gy are needed for local control in adenoid cystic carcinomas. These tumor doses cannot be delivered if the tolerance doses to neighboring organs at risk (OAR) are respected. This treatment planning study investigates the physical advantage of combined photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plus carbon ion boost compared to photon IMRT alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For nine patients, treatment plans were generated using a) photon IMRT alone (integrated boost concept), and b) sum plans consisting of a photon IMRT plan and a carbon ion boost plan. 54 Gy were prescribed to the planning target volume 1 (PTV1), the boost volume (PTV2) received 72 Gy. The tolerance doses of the delineated OAR were strictly adhered to. Plan quality of IMRT plans and sum plans was compared using adequate physical parameters. RESULTS: Both therapy techniques lead to highly conformal dose distributions that allow the prescription of the desired target doses. Target conformality and heterogeneity as well as target coverage for PTV1 are comparable for both techniques. The target coverage for PTV2 can be significantly improved using carbon ion beams (median 95\% coverage 93.7\% vs 87\%; p = 0.039). Furthermore, the mean doses to the OAR can be reduced by 8.3\% (median \% reduction of mean doses to OAR; p = 0.00001) using carbon ions. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of photon IMRT with carbon ions improves the target coverage for the boost volume and offers better sparing of OAR close to the PTV2 (gross tumor volume) in comparison with photon IMRT alone. A clinical study has been initiated to evaluate whether these potential advantages translate into clinical benefit",

abstract="Spinal chordomas cannot be treated with an effective dose using conventional radiation therapy (RT) without exceeding the tolerance dose of the spinal cord while ensuring sufficient target coverage at the same time. In this study we investigate the potential physical advantages of combined photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and raster-scanned carbon ion RT over photon IMRT alone. For a representative patient we generated a carbon ion RT plan and a photon IMRT plan. Additionally, combined plans consisting of both carbon ions and photon IMRT were calculated using ratios of 20:40 GyE, 30:30 GyE and 40:20 GyE. The best target coverage was obtained using carbon ions alone. Using a combination of photon IMRT and carbon ions, the target coverage was better than with photon IMRT alone. Due to the applied dose constraints, the sparing of the spinal cord was comparable for all plans. Using carbon ions alone, the non-target tissue volume irradiated to at least 30 GyE/50.4 GyE was reduced by 72\%/84\% compared to photon IMRT alone. These advantages were evident even with combined techniques. The actually delivered dose distribution is expected to be more dependent on patient misalignment with carbon ions compared with photon IMRT. A combination of carbon ions and photon IMRT might be preferable in order to profit by the physical advantages of carbon ions while ensuring a safe treatment",

Eighty-seven patients with chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base received carbon ion RT alone (median dose 60 GyE); 21 patients with unfavorable adenoid cystic carcinomas and 17 patients with spinal (n = 9) and sacrococcygeal (n = 8) chordomas and chondrosarcomas were treated with combined photon and carbon ion RT. Twelve patients received reirradiation with carbon ions with or without photon RT for recurrent tumors. Furthermore, 15 patients with skull base tumors other than chordoma and low-grade chondrosarcoma were treated with carbon ions.ResultsActuarial 3-year local control was 81\% for chordomas, 100\% for chondrosarcomas, and 62\% for adenoid cystic carcinomas. Local control was obtained in 15/17 patients with spinal (8/9) and sacral (7/8) chordomas or chondrosarcomas and in 11/15 patients with skull base tumors other than chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas, respectively. Six of 12 patients who received reirradiation are still alive without signs of tumor progression. Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 4 or Grade 5 toxicity was not observed.ConclusionCarbon ion therapy is safe with respect to toxicity and offers high local control rates for skull base tumors such as chordomas, low-grade chondrosarcomas, and unfavorable adenoid cystic carcinomas",

abstract="BACKGROUND: The authors evaluated whether modern photon techniques, such as stereotactic fractionated radiation therapy (FSRT) or intensity-modulated RT, outweighed the biologic advantages of high-linear-energy transfer RT in the treatment of patients with locally advanced adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC) that infiltrated the skull base or the orbit. METHODS: Between June 1995 and December 2003, 63 patients with ACC were treated with modern RT techniques at the University of Heidelberg. The treatment results achieved with modern photon techniques alone were compared with the results achieved with combined photon RT and a carbon ion boost. Twenty-nine patients (Group A) were treated with a combination of photon RT and a carbon ion boost. Thirty-four patients (Group B) received photon RT alone. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 16 months for Group A and 24 months for Group B. Locoregional control rates at 2 years and 4 years were 77.5\% and 77.5\% for Group A and 72.2\% and 24.6\% for Group B, respectively (P = 0.08; log-rank test). Disease-free and overall survival rates at 2 years/4 years were 71.5\%/53\% and 86.6\%/75.8\% for Group A and 69.2\%/23\% and 77.9\%/77.9\% for Group B, respectively. Rates for severe late toxicity were < 5\% for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Modern RT techniques allowed the safe delivery of high target doses to patients with locally advanced ACC. Late toxicity rates were kept lower compared with the historic neutron therapy data. A combination of modern photon RT and carbon ion RT seemed to be advantageous, with a trend toward higher locoregional control rates compared with modern photon RT alone",

In addition, beams of ions heavier than (4)He exhibit a strong increase of the linear energy transfer in the Bragg peak as compared with the entrance region. These physical and biological properties are much more favorable than in photon radiotherapy. As a consequence, particle therapy with protons and heavy ions has gained increasing interest worldwide, and many clinical centers are considering introducing radiation therapy with charged particles. This contribution summarizes the physical and technical principles of charged particle therapy with protons and heavy ions. It briefly reviews the clinical experience gathered so far with proton therapy and gives a more detailed summary of the recent results in carbon ion therapy of skull base tumors, head and neck tumors, non-small-cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinomas, bone and soft-tissue sarcomas, and prostate cancer",

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between November 1998 and July 2005, a total of 96 patients with chordomas of the skull base have been treated with carbon ion radiation therapy (RT) using the raster scan technique at the Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany. All patients had gross residual tumors. Median total dose was 60 CGE (range, 60-70 CGE) delivered in 20 fractions within 3 weeks. Local control and overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE v.3.0) and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) / European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) score. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 31 months (range, 3-91 months). Fifteen patients developed local recurrences after carbon ion RT. The actuarial local control rates were 80.6\% and 70.0\% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Target doses in excess of 60 CGE and primary tumor status were associated with higher local control rates. Overall survival was 91.8\% and 88.5\% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Late toxicity consisted of optic nerve neuropathy RTOG/EORTC Grade 3 in 4.1\% of the patients and necrosis of a fat plomb in 1 patient. Minor temporal lobe injury (RTOG/EORTC Grade 1-2) occurred in 7 patients (7.2\%). CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion RT offers an effective treatment option for skull-base chordomas with acceptable toxicity. Doses in excess of 75 CGE with 2 CGE per fraction are likely to increase local control probability",

This review describes the physical, biologic, and technologic aspects of particle beam therapy.

abstract="291 breast cancer patients treated with conserving surgery and subsequent locoregional irradiation were studied. The method of surgery consisted of 200 lumpectomies, 76 quadrantectomies and 15 with either a wide excision or with an atypical resection. In at least 42.6\% (124 out of 291), the tumor had been within 10 mm distance to the margin of resected specimen, in 13.4\% (39 out of 291) the tumor even reached the border. In the other reports, a numerical description of the distance to the margins was not given. Postoperative radiotherapy was applied with 50 Gy cobalt-60/6-MeV photons to include the whole breast. A boost of tangentially opposed photon beams was added, replacing a technique with direct electron fields used in an earlier period during three years. The supraclavicular fossa received 46 Gy, the retrosternal pathway was covered with 45 to 50 Gy photons/electrons. Locoregional failure after an average observation time of 39.5 months was 4.5\% (13 out of 291), within the target volume 3.8\% (11 out of 291. The 39 cases on which the tumor reached the margin of resection, 92.3\% (36 out of 39) remained free of recurrences. With a tumor-free resection line but a maximal distance of 10 mm, one recurrence (1.2\% or 1 out of 85) was found. With the application of tangential photon beams to the tumor bed, which technically allowed sparing skin parts but also slightly reduced daily doses, the incidence of telangiectasis could be lowered to 2.5\%. An anatomical was model was constructed to resemble a patient in the treatment position. Dosimeters were implanted and verified by computed tomography. Measurements of the radiation fields were performed within the breast, the lung and along the mammaria-interna chain. Minimal angle changes of 5 degrees decreased the retrosternal dose down with the amount of 56.5\%, 10 degrees of 75\% and 15 degrees of 85.7\%. In contrast, moving the central axis medially by 1 cm and 2 cm increased the lung dose 2.2 and 4.4 times, respectively, whereas the dose within the breast remained almost equal. This emphasizes the importance of identical positioning, which must be realized 25 to 35 times throughout the course of therapy, often with different staff! Precision and consistent positioning are the main priorities. If these goals are achieved, lumpectomy with subsequent high-dose radiotherapy respecting cosmetics provides patients with excellent quality of life",

abstract="Tumors in the chest and abdomen move during respiration. The ability of conventional radiation therapy systems to compensate for respiratory motion by moving the radiation source is inherently limited. Since safety margins currently used in radiation therapy increase the radiation dose by a very large amount, an accurate tracking method for following the motion of the tumor is of the utmost clinical relevance. We investigate methods to compensate for respiratory motion using robotic radiosurgery. Thus, the therapeutic beam is moved by a robotic arm, and follows the moving target tumor. To determine the precise position of the moving target, we combine infrared tracking with synchronized X-ray imaging. Infrared emitters are used to record the motion of the patient's skin surface. A stereo X-ray imaging system provides information about the location of internal markers. During an initialization phase (prior to treatment), the correlation between the motions observed by the two sensors (X-ray imaging and infrared tracking) is computed. This model is also continuously updated during treatment to compensate for other, non-respiratory motion. Experiments and clinical trials suggest that robot-based methods can substantially reduce the safety margins currently needed in radiation therapy",

abstract="Respiratory motion is difficult to compensate for with conventional radiotherapy systems. An accurate tracking method for following the motion of the tumor is of considerable clinical relevance. We investigate methods to compensate for respiratory motion using robotic radiosurgery. In this system the therapeutic beam is moved by a robotic arm, and follows the moving target through a combination of infrared tracking and synchronized x-ray imaging. Infrared emitters are used to record the motion of the patient's skin surface. The position of internal gold fiducials is computed repeatedly during treatment, via x-ray image processing. We correlate the motion between external and internal markers. From this correlation model we infer the placement of the internal target during time intervals where no x-ray images are taken. Fifteen patients with lung tumors have recently been treated with a fully integrated system implementing this new method. The clinical trials confirm our hypothesis that internal motion and external motion are indeed correlated. In a preliminar study we have extended our work to tracking without implanted fiducials, based on algorithms for computing deformation motions and digitally reconstructed radiographs",

In previous work we described a method for real-time tracking based on correlation between the motion of implanted fiducial markers and external skin markers.

We propose to use deformation algorithms on CT data sets combined with registration of digitally reconstructed radiographs and intra-treatment X-ray images to obtain intermittent information on the target location. This information is then combined with our basic correlation method to achieve real-time tracking.

abstract="Interplay between organ (breathing) motion and leaf motion has been shown in the literature to have a small dosimetric impact for clinical conditions (over a 30 fraction treatment). However, previous studies did not consider the case of treatment beams made up of many few-monitor-unit (MU) segments, where the segment delivery time (1-2 s) is of the order of the breathing period (3-5 s). In this study we assess if breathing compromises the radiotherapy treatment with IMRT segments of low number of MUs. We assess (i) how delivered dose varies, from patient to patient, with the number of MU per segment, (ii) if this delivered dose is identical to the average dose calculated without motion over the path of the motion, and (iii) the impact of the daily variation of the delivered dose as a function of MU per segment. The organ motion was studied along two orthogonal directions, representing the left-right and cranial-caudal directions of organ movement for a patient setup in the supine position. Breathing motion was modeled as sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x), based on functions used in the literature to represent organ motion. Measurements were performed with an ionization chamber and films. For a systematic study of motion effects, a MATLAB simulation was written to model organ movement and dose delivery. In the case of a single beam made up of one single segment, the dose delivered to point in a moving target over 30 fractions can vary up to 20\% and 10\% for segments of 10 MU and 20 MU, respectively. This dose error occurs because the tumor spends most of the time near the edges of the radiation beam. In the case of a single beam made of multiple segments with low MU, we observed 2.4\%, 3.3\%, and 4.3\% differences, respectively, for sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x) motion, between delivered dose and motion-averaged dose for points in the penumbra region of the beam and over 30 fractions. In approximately 5-10\% of the cases, differences between the motion-averaged dose and the delivered 30-fraction dose could reach 6\%, 8\% and 10-12\%, respectively for sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x) motion. To analyze a clinical IMRT beam, two patient plans were randomly selected. For one of the patients, the beams showed a likelihood of up to 25.6\% that the delivered dose would deviate from the motion-averaged dose by more than 1\%. For the second patient, there was a likelihood of up to 62.8\% of delivering a dose that differs by more than 1\% from the motion-averaged dose and a likelihood of up to approximately 30\% for a 2\% dose error. For the entire five-beam IMRT plan, statistical averaging over the beams reduces the overall dose error between the delivered dose and the motion-averaged dose. For both patients there was a likelihood of up to 7.0\% and 33.9\% that the dose error was greater than 1\%, respectively. For one of the patients, there was a 12.6\% likelihood of a 2\% dose error. Daily intrafraction variation of the delivered dose of more than 10\% is non-negligible and can potentially lead to biological effects. We observed [for sin(x), sin4(x), and sin6(x)] that below 10-15 MU leads to large daily variations of the order of 15-35\%. Therefore, for small MU segments, non-negligible biological effects can be incurred. We conclude that for most clinical cases the effects may be small because of the use of many beams, it is desirable to avoid low-MU segments when treating moving targets. In addition, dose averaging may not work well for hypo-fractionation, where fewer fractions are used. For hypo-fractionation, PDF modeling of the tumor motion in IMRT optimization may not be adequate",

abstract="Treatment delivery with active beam scanning in proton radiation therapy introduces the problem of interplay effects when pencil beam motion occurs on a similar time scale as intra-fractional tumor motion. In situations where fractionation may not provide enough repetition to blur the effects of interplay, repeated delivery or 'repainting' of each field several times within a fraction has been suggested. The purpose of this work was to investigate the effectiveness of different repainting strategies in proton beam scanning. To assess the dosimetric impact of interplay effects, we performed a series of simulations considering the following parameters: tumor motion amplitude, breathing period, asymmetry in the motion trajectory for the target and time required to change the beam energy for the delivery system. Several repainting strategies were compared in terms of potential vulnerability to a dose delivery error. Breathing motion perpendicular to the beam direction (representing superior-inferior type tumor motion in patients) was considered and modeled as an asymmetric sine function with a peak-to-peak amplitude of between 10 and 30 mm. The results show that motion effects cause a narrowing of the high-dose profile and widening of the penumbra. The 90\% isodose area was reduced significantly when considering a large motion amplitude of 3 cm. The broadening of the penumbra appears to depend only on the amplitude of tumor motion (assuming harmonic motion). The delivered dose exhibits a shift of 10-15\% of the tumor amplitude (or 1-5 mm) in the caudal direction due to breathing asymmetry observed for both sin(4)(x) and sin(6)(x) motion. Of the five repainting techniques studied, so-called 'breath sampling' turned out to be most effective in reducing dose errors with a minimal increase in treatment time. In this method, each energy level is repainted at several evenly spaced times within one breathing period. To keep dose delivery errors below 5\% while minimizing treatment time, it is recommended that breath sampling repainting be employed using 5-10 paintings per field for an assumed tumor volume of 8.5 x 8.5 x 10 cm(3). For smaller tumor volumes more repaintings will be required, while for larger volumes five repaintings should be sufficient to achieve the required dose accuracy",

abstract="Respiratory motion can cause artifacts in myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images, which can lead to the misdiagnosis of cardiac diseases. One method to correct for respiratory artifacts is through respiratory gating. We study the effectiveness of respiratory gating through a simulation study using the newly developed four-dimensional (4-D) NURBS-based cardiac-torso (NCAT) phantom. The organ shapes in the 4-D NCAT phantom are formed using nonuniform rational b-splines NURBS) and are based on detailed human image data. With its basis on actual human data, the 4-D NCAT phantom realistically simulates human anatomy and motions such as the cardiac and respiratory motions. With the 4-D NCAT phantom, we generated 128 phantoms over one respiratory cycle (5 s per cycle) with the diaphragm and heart set to move a total of 4 cm from end-inspiration to end-expiration. The heart was set to beat with a normal contractile motion at a rate of 1 beat per second resulting in a total of five heart cycles. We divide the respiratory cycle into different numbers of respiratory gates (16, 8, and 4) by summing the phantoms. For each gate, we generate its projection data using an analytical projection algorithm simulating the effects of attenuation, scatter, and detector response. We then reconstruct the projections using an iterative OS-EM algorithm compensating for the three effects. The reconstructed images for each gating method were examined for artifacts due to the respiratory motion during that gate. We found that respiratory artifacts are significantly reduced if the respiratory motion of the heart that occurs during a gating time period is 1 cm or less. We conclude that respiratory gating is an effective method for reducing effects due to respiration. The timing of the respiratory gates for reduced image artifacts is dependent on the extent of the heart's motion during respiration",

abstract="In this work, three-dimensional (3D) motion of lung tumors during radiotherapy in real time was investigated. Understanding the behavior of tumor motion in lung tissue to model tumor movement is necessary for accurate (gated or breath-hold) radiotherapy or CT scanning. Twenty patients were included in this study. Before treatment, a 2-mm gold marker was implanted in or near the tumor. A real-time tumor tracking system using two fluoroscopy image processor units was installed in the treatment room. The 3D position of the implanted gold marker was determined by using real-time pattern recognition and a calibrated projection geometry. The linear accelerator was triggered to irradiate the tumor only when the gold marker was located within a certain volume. The system provided the coordinates of the gold marker during beam-on and beam-off time in all directions simultaneously, at a sample rate of 30 images per second. The recorded tumor motion was analyzed in terms of the amplitude and curvature of the tumor motion in three directions, the differences in breathing level during treatment, hysteresis (the difference between the inhalation and exhalation trajectory of the tumor), and the amplitude of tumor motion induced by cardiac motion. The average amplitude of the tumor motion was greatest (12 {\backslash}pm 2 mm [SD]) in the cranial-caudal direction for tumors situated in the lower lobes and not attached to rigid structures such as the chest wall or vertebrae. For the lateral and anterior-posterior directions, tumor motion was small both for upper- and lower-lobe tumors (2 {\backslash}pm 1 mm). The time-averaged tumor position was closer to the exhale position, because the tumor spent more time in the exhalation than in the inhalation phase. The tumor motion was modeled as a sinusoidal movement with varying asymmetry. The tumor position in the exhale phase was more stable than the tumor position in the inhale phase during individual treatment fields. However, in many patients, shifts in the exhale tumor position were observed intra- and interfractionally. These shifts are the result of patient relaxation, gravity (posterior direction), setup errors, and/or patient movement.The 3D trajectory of the tumor showed hysteresis for 10 of the 21 tumors, which ranged from 1 to 5 mm. The extent of hysteresis and the amplitude of the tumor motion remained fairly constant during the entire treatment. Changes in shape of the trajectory of the tumor were observed between subsequent treatment days for only one patient. Fourier analysis revealed that for 7 of the 21 tumors, a measurable motion in the range 1-4 mm was caused by the cardiac beat. These tumors were located near the heart or attached to the aortic arch. The motion due to the heartbeat was greatest in the lateral direction. Tumor motion due to hysteresis and heartbeat can lower treatment efficiency in real-time tumor tracking-gated treatments or lead to a geographic miss in conventional or active breathing controlled treatments. The real-time tumor tracking system measured the tumor position in all three directions simultaneously, at a sampling rate that enabled detection of tumor motion due to heartbeat as well as hysteresis. Tumor motion and hysteresis could be modeled with an asymmetric function with varying asymmetry. Tumor motion due to breathing was greatest in the cranial-caudal direction for lower-lobe unfixed tumors",

abstract="The Synchrony Respiratory Tracking System (RTS) is a treatment option of the CyberKnife robotic treatment device to irradiate extra-cranial tumors that move due to respiration. Advantages of RTS are that patients can breath normally and that there is no loss of linac duty cycle such as with gated therapy. Tracking is based on a measured correspondence model (linear or polynomial) between internal tumor motion and external (chest/abdominal) marker motion. The radiation beam follows the tumor movement via the continuously measured external marker motion. To establish the correspondence model at the start of treatment, the 3D internal tumor position is determined at 15 discrete time points by automatic detection of implanted gold fiducials in two orthogonal x-ray images; simultaneously, the positions of the external markers are measured. During the treatment, the relationship between internal and external marker positions is continuously accounted for and is regularly checked and updated. Here we use computer simulations based on continuously and simultaneously recorded internal and external marker positions to investigate the effectiveness of tumor tracking by the RTS. The Cyberknife does not allow continuous acquisition of x-ray images to follow the moving internal markers (typical imaging frequency is once per minute). Therefore, for the simulations, we have used data for eight lung cancer patients treated with respiratory gating. All of these patients had simultaneous and continuous recordings of both internal tumor motion and external abdominal motion. The available continuous relationship between internal and external markers for these patients allowed investigation of the consequences of the lower acquisition frequency of the RTS. With the use of the RTS, simulated treatment errors due to breathing motion were reduced largely and consistently over treatment time for all studied patients. A considerable part of the maximum reduction in treatment error could already be reached with a simple linear model. In case of hysteresis, a polynomial model added some extra reduction. More frequent updating of the correspondence model resulted in slightly smaller errors only for the few recordings with a time trend that was fast, relative to the current x-ray update frequency. In general, the simulations suggest that the applied combined use of internal and external markers allow the robot to accurately follow tumor motion even in the case of irregularities in breathing patterns",

abstract="A two-dimensional position sensitive dosimetry system based on a scintillating gas detector has been developed for pre-treatment verification of dose distributions in hadron therapy. The dosimetry system consists of a chamber filled with an Ar/CF4 scintillating gas mixture, inside which two cascaded gas electron multipliers (GEMs) are mounted. A GEM is a thin kapton foil with copper cladding structured with a regular pattern of sub-mm holes. The primary electrons, created in the detector's sensitive volume by the incoming beam, drift in an electric field towards the GEMs and undergo gas multiplication in the GEM holes. During this process, photons are emitted by the excited Ar/CF4 gas molecules and detected by a mirror-lens-CCD camera system. Since the amount of emitted light is proportional to the dose deposited in the sensitive volume of the detector by the incoming beam, the intensity distribution of the measured light spot is proportional to the 2D hadron dose distribution. For a measurement of a 3D dose distribution, the scintillating gas detector is mounted at the beam exit side of a water-bellows phantom, whose thickness can be varied in steps. In this work, the energy dependence of the output signal of the scintillating gas detector has been verified in a 250 MeV/u clinical 12C ion beam by means of a depth-dose curve measurement. The underestimation of the measured signal at the Bragg peak depth is only 9\% with respect to an air-filled ionization chamber. This is much smaller than the underestimation found for a scintillating Gd2O2S:Tb ('Lanex') screen under the same measurement conditions (43\%). Consequently, the scintillating gas detector is a promising device for verifying dose distributions in high LET beams, for example to check hadron therapy treatment plans which comprise beams with different energies",

abstract="Motion of thoracic tumors with respiration presents a challenge for three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiation therapy treatment. Validation of techniques aimed at measuring and minimizing the effects of respiratory motion requires a realistic deformable phantom for use as a gold standard. The purpose of this study was to develop and study the characteristics of a reproducible, tissue equivalent, deformable lung phantom. The phantom consists of a Lucite cylinder filled with water containing a latex balloon stuffed with dampened natural sponges. The balloon is attached to a piston that mimics the human diaphragm. Nylon wires and Lucite beads, emulating vascular and bronchial bifurcations, were uniformly glued at various locations throughout the sponges. The phantom is capable of simulating programmed irregular breathing patterns with varying periods and amplitudes. A tissue equivalent tumor, suitable for holding radiochromic film for dose measurements was embedded in the sponge. To assess phantom motion, eight 3D computed tomography data sets of the static phantom were acquired for eight equally spaced positions of the piston. The 3D trajectories of 12 manually chosen point landmarks and the tumor center-of-mass were studied. Motion reproducibility tests of the deformed phantom were established on seven repeat scans of three different states of compression. Deformable image registration (DIR) of the extreme breathing phases was performed. The accuracy of the DIR was evaluated by visual inspection of image overlays and quantified by the distance-to-agreement (DTA) of manually chosen point landmarks and triangulated surfaces obtained from 3D contoured structures. In initial tests of the phantom, a 20-mm excursion of the piston resulted in deformations of the balloon of 20 mm superior-inferior, 4 mm anterior-posterior, and 5 mm left-right. The change in the phantom mean lung density ranged from 0.24 (0.12 SD) g/cm3 at peak exhale to 0.19 (0.12 SD) g/cm3 at peak inhale. The SI displacement of the landmarks varied between 94\% and 3\% of the piston excursion for positions closer and farther away from the piston, respectively. The reproducibility of the phantom deformation was within the image resolution (0.7 x 0.7 x 1.25 mm3). Vector average registration accuracy based on point landmarks was found to be 0.5 (0.4 SD) mm. The tumor and lung mean 3D DTA obtained from triangulated surfaces were 0.4 (0.1 SD) mm and 1.0 (0.8 SD) mm, respectively. This phantom is capable of reproducibly emulating the physically realistic lung features and deformations and has a wide range of potential applications, including four-dimensional (4D) imaging, evaluation of deformable registration accuracy, 4D planning and dose delivery",

abstract="Spline-based deformable registration methods are quite popular within the medical-imaging community due to their flexibility and robustness. However, they require a large amount of computing time to obtain adequate results. This paper makes two contributions towards accelerating B-spline-based registration. First, we propose a grid-alignment scheme and associated data structures that greatly reduce the complexity of the registration algorithm. Based on this grid-alignment scheme, we then develop highly data parallel designs for B-spline registration within the stream-processing model, suitable for implementation on multi-core processors such as graphics processing units (GPUs). Particular attention is focused on an optimal method for performing analytic gradient computations in a data parallel fashion. CPU and GPU versions are validated for execution time and registration quality. Performance results on large images show that our GPU algorithm achieves a speedup of 15 times over the single-threaded CPU implementation whereas our multi-core CPU algorithm achieves a speedup of 8 times over the single-threaded implementation. The CPU and GPU versions achieve near-identical registration quality in terms of RMS differences between the generated vector fields",

abstract="BACKGROUND: A variety of catheter-based energy modalities are used for cardiac ablation to treat arrhythmias. Robotic radiosurgery is increasingly being utilized to successfully accomplish precise tissue ablation in anatomically remote areas. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the experimental feasibility of a noninvasive method using stereotactic robotic radiosurgery (SRS) to create cardiac lesions. METHODS: Sixteen (16) Hanford-Sinclair mini swine (weight 40-70 kg) under general anesthesia were studied. Baseline computed tomographic scans were performed, followed by electroanatomic mapping using the CARTO system. Stereotactic robotic radiosurgery was performed using the CyberHeart system, with predetermined targets at the cavotricuspid isthmus, AV node, pulmonary vein-left atrial junction, or left atrial appendage. From 25 to 196 days after treatment, the animals were investigated with repeat electroanatomic voltage mapping and transesophageal echocardiography, when possible. The animals then were sacrificed and pathology specimens taken. RESULTS: Dose ranging suggested that 25 Gy was needed to produce an electrophysiologic effect. The time course showed an electrophysiologic effect consistently by 90 days. The method was feasible for producing bidirectional cavotricuspid isthmus block and AV nodal conduction block. The pulmonary vein-left atrial junction and left atrial appendage showed marked voltage reduction to less than 0.05 mV. No spontaneous arrhythmias were observed. Pathology specimens showed no evidence of radiation damage outside the target. Histology samples from target sites showed effects consistent with X-beam radiation. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic robotic radiosurgery can produce cavotricuspid isthmus block, AV nodal block, and significant decreased voltage at the pulmonary vein-left atrial junction. No other organ damage was seen. The study findings demonstrate the feasibility of this noninvasive treatment method for creating cardiac lesions. This approach merits further investigation in the treatment of arrhythmias",

abstract="Image guidance in radiotherapy and extracranial radiosurgery offers the potential for precise radiation dose delivery to a moving tumour. Recent work has demonstrated how to locate and track the position of a tumour in real-time using diagnostic x-ray imaging to find implanted radio-opaque markers. However, the delivery of a treatment plan through gating or beam tracking requires adequate consideration of treatment system latencies, including image acquisition, image processing, communication delays, control system processing, inductance within the motor, mechanical damping, etc. Furthermore, the imaging dose given over long radiosurgery procedures or multiple radiotherapy fractions may not be insignificant, which means that we must reduce the sampling rate of the imaging system. This study evaluates various predictive models for reducing tumour localization errors when a real-time tumour-tracking system targets a moving tumour at a slow imaging rate and with large system latencies. We consider 14 lung tumour cases where the peak-to-peak motion is greater than 8 mm, and compare the localization error using linear prediction, neural network prediction and Kalman filtering, against a system which uses no prediction. To evaluate prediction accuracy for use in beam tracking, we compute the root mean squared error between predicted and actual 3D motion. We found that by using prediction, root mean squared error is improved for all latencies and all imaging rates evaluated. To evaluate prediction accuracy for use in gated treatment, we present a new metric that compares a gating control signal based on predicted motion against the best possible gating control signal. We found that using prediction improves gated treatment accuracy for systems that have latencies of 200 ms or greater, and for systems that have imaging rates of 10 Hz or slower",

This prospective, randomized study was done to compare two types of Posicast thermoplastic face masks, in terms of reproducibility, patient comfort, tolerability, and skin damage.Methods and materialsThe patients were randomly assigned to use a head mask (HM) or a head-and-shoulder mask (HSM). Three-dimensional treatment planning was followed by fractionated external-beam radiation therapy. Reproducibility was assessed by comparing port films with simulator films twice during treatment and by comparing actual treatment table positions weekly. Patient tolerability and comfort were studied weekly. The radiation-induced skin damage was assessed every week according to the World Health Organization toxicity scale.ResultsA total of 260 patients were included, and 241 (93\%) were evaluated. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups (HM or HSM) in terms of reproducibility. Patients using HSM experienced significantly more claustrophobia (p = 0.023). Patients allocated to HSM receiving \${\backslash}geq\$60 Gy were found to have more skin reactions.ConclusionsThe smaller HM reduced feelings of claustrophobia, as well as skin reactions, for patients receiving \${\backslash}geq\$60 Gy.

abstract="Conventional radiotherapy is planned using free-breathing computed tomography (CT), ignoring the motion and deformation of the anatomy from respiration. New breath-hold-synchronized, gated, and four-dimensional (4D) CT acquisition strategies are enabling radiotherapy planning utilizing a set of CT scans belonging to different phases of the breathing cycle. Such 4D treatment planning relies on the availability of tumor and organ contours in all phases. The current practice of manual segmentation is impractical for 4D CT, because it is time consuming and tedious. A viable solution is registration-based segmentation, through which contours provided by an expert for a particular phase are propagated to all other phases while accounting for phase-to-phase motion and anatomical deformation. Deformable image registration is central to this task, and a free-form deformation-based nonrigid image registration algorithm will be presented. Compared with the original algorithm, this version uses novel, computationally simpler geometric constraints to preserve the topology of the dense control-point grid used to represent free-form deformation and prevent tissue fold-over. Using mean squared difference as an image similarity criterion, the inhale phase is registered to the exhale phase of lung CT scans of five patients and of characteristically low-contrast abdominal CT scans of four patients. In addition, using expert contours for the inhale phase, the corresponding contours were automatically generated for the exhale phase. The accuracy of the segmentation (and hence deformable image registration) was judged by comparing automatically segmented contours with expert contours traced directly in the exhale phase scan using three metrics: volume overlap index, root mean square distance, and Hausdorff distance. The accuracy of the segmentation (in terms of radial distance mismatch) was approximately 2 mm in the thorax and 3 mm in the abdomen, which compares favorably to the accuracies reported elsewhere. Unlike most prior work, segmentation of the tumor is also presented. The clinical implementation of 4D treatment planning is critically dependent on automatic segmentation, for which is offered one of the most accurate algorithms yet presented",

abstract="Purpose: A real-time tracking radiotherapy was investigated to assess its usefulness in precise localization and verification of prostate and bladder cancers.Methods and Materials: The real-time tracking radiation therapy (RTRT) system consists of implantation of a 2.0-mm gold marker into a clinical target volume (CTV), three-dimensional radiation treatment planning (3DRTP) system, and the use of two sets of diagnostic x-ray television systems in the linear accelerator room, image processing units, and an image display unit. The position of the patient can be corrected by adjusting the actual marker position to the planned marker position, which has been transferred from the 3DRTP and superimposed on the fluoroscopic image on the display unit of the RTRT system. The position of the markers can be visualized during irradiation and after treatment delivery to verify the accuracy of the localization. Ten patients with prostate cancer and 5 patients with bladder cancer were examined using this system for the treatment setup on 91 occasions.Results: After manual setup using skin markers, the median of absolute value of discrepancies between the actual position of the marker and the planned position of the marker for prostate cancer was 3.4 (0.1-8.9) mm, 4.1 (0.2-18.1) mm, and 2.3 (0.0-10.6) mm for the lateral, anteroposterior, and craniocaudal directions, respectively. The 3D median distance between the actual and planned positions of the marker was 6.9 (1.1-18.2) mm for prostate cancer and 6.9 (1.7-18.6) mm for bladder cancer.

abstract="PURPOSE: External radiotherapy for lung tumors requires reducing the uncertainty due to setup error and organ motion. We investigated the three-dimensional movement of lung tumors through an inserted internal marker using a real-time tumor-tracking system and evaluated the efficacy of this system at reducing the internal margin. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four patients with lung cancer were analyzed. A 2.0-mm gold marker was inserted into the tumor. The real-time tumor-tracking system calculates and stores three-dimensional coordinates of the marker 30 times/s. The system can trigger the linear accelerator to irradiate the tumor only when the marker is located within the predetermined ``permitted dislocation.'' The value was set at +/-1 to +/-3 mm according to the patient's characteristics. We analyzed 10,413-14,893 data sets for each of the 4 patients. The range of marker movement during normal breathing (beam-off period) was compared with that during gated irradiation (beam-on period) by Student's t test. RESULTS: The range of marker movement during the beam-off period was 5.5-10.0 mm in the lateral direction (x), 6.8-15.9 mm in the craniocaudal direction (y) and 8.1-14.6 mm in the ventrodorsal direction (z). The range during the beam-on period was reduced to within 5.3 mm in all directions in all 4 patients. A significant difference was found between the mean of the range during the beam-off period and the mean of the range during the beam-on period in the x (p = 0.007), y (p = 0.025), and z (p = 0.002) coordinates, respectively. CONCLUSION: The real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy system was useful to analyze the movement of an internal marker. Treatment with megavoltage X-rays was properly given when the tumor marker moved into the ``permitted dislocation'' zone from the planned position",

abstract="PURPOSE: Interportal adjustment was applied to patients with prostate cancer using three fiducial markers and two sets of fluoroscopy in a real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy (RTRT) system. The incidence of table position adjustment required to keep intrafractional uncertainty within 2.0 mm was investigated in this study. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The coordinates of the center of gravity of the three fiducial markers were measured at the start of every portal irradiation in intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with seven ports. The table position was adjusted to the planned position if the discrepancy was larger than 2.0 mm in the anterior-posterior (AP), cranial-caudal (CC), or left-right (LR) directions. In total, we analyzed 4,541 observations in 20 patients who received 70 Gy in 30 fractions (7.6 times a day on average). RESULTS: The incidence of table position adjustment at 10 minutes from the initial setup of each treatment was 14.2\%, 12.3\%, and 5.0\% of the observations in the AP, CC, and LR directions, respectively. The accumulated incidence of the table position adjustment was significantly higher at 10 minutes than at 2 minutes for AP (p = 0.0033) and CC (p = 0.0110) but not LR (p = 0.4296). An adjustment greater than 5 mm was required at least once in the treatment period in 11 (55\%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Interportal adjustment of table position was required in more than 10\% of portal irradiations during the 10-minute period after initial setup to maintain treatment accuracy within 2.0 mm",

abstract="BACKGROUND: We prospectively assessed the utility of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with urethral dose reduction and a small margin between the clinical target volume (CTV) and the planning target volume (PTV) for patients with localized prostate cancer. METHODS: The study population was 110 patients in low- (14.5\%), intermediate- (41.8\%), and high-risk (43.6\%) categories. Three gold fiducial markers were inserted into the prostate. A soft guide-wire was used to identify the urethra when computed tomography (CT) scan for treatment planning was performed. A dose constraint of V70 < 10\% was applied to the urethral region. Margins between the CTV-PTV were set at 3 mm in all directions. Patients were treated with 70 Gy IMRT in 30 fractions (D95 of PTV) over 7.5 weeks. The patient couch was adjusted to keep the gold markers within 2.0 mm from their planned positions with the use of frequent on-line verification. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 31.3 (3.2 to 82.1) months. The biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS) rates at 3 years were 100\%, 93.8\% and 89.5\% for the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients, respectively. The incidences of acute adverse events (AEs) were 45.5\% and 0.9\% for grades 1 and 2, respectively. The late AEs were grade 1 cystitis in 10.0\% of the patients, rectal bleeding in 7.3\%, and urinary urgency in 6.4\%. Only three patients (2.7\%) developed grade 2 late AEs. CONCLUSIONS: On-line image guidance with precise correction of the table position during radiotherapy achieved one of the lowest AEs rates with a bRFS equal to the highest in the literature",

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical results of proton radiotherapy for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1983 and 2000, 51 NSCLC patients were treated with proton beams at the University of Tsukuba. There were 28 patients in Stage I, 9 in Stage II, 8 in Stage III, 1 in Stage IV, and 5 with recurrent disease. Thirty-three patients had squamous cell carcinoma, 17 had adenocarcinoma, and 1 had large-cell carcinoma. Median fraction and total doses given were 3.0 Gy (range 2.0-6.0 Gy), and 76.0 Gy (range 49.0-93.0 Gy), respectively. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rate was 29\% for all patients, 70\% for 9 Stage IA patients, and 16\% for 19 Stage IB patients, respectively (IA vs. IB: p < 0.05). The 5-year in-field local control rate was higher in patients with Stage IA (89\%) when compared with those with Stage IB (39\%). Forty-seven patients (92\%) experienced acute lung toxicity of Grade 1 or less; 3 had Grade 2, 1 had Grade 3, and none experienced Grade 4 or higher. Patients in the present series showed very little late toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy is a very safe and effective treatment for patients with NSCLC, especially for those with early stages. The relative merit of proton therapy in comparison with stereotactic photon radiotherapy or three-dimensional conformal photon radiotherapy remains to be defined through future clinical trials",

abstract="Recent advances in external beam radiotherapy have allowed us to deliver higher doses to the tumors while decreasing doses to the surrounding tissues. Dose escalation using high-precision radiotherapy has improved the treatment outcomes of prostate cancer. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy has been widely used throughout the world as the most advanced form of photon radiotherapy. In contrast, particle radiotherapy has also been under development, and has been used as an effective and non-invasive radiation modality for prostate and other cancers. Among the particles used in such treatments, protons and carbon ions have the physical advantage that the dose can be focused on the tumor with only minimal exposure of the surrounding normal tissues. Furthermore, carbon ions also have radiobiological advantages that include higher killing effects on intrinsic radio-resistant tumors, hypoxic tumor cells and tumor cells in the G0 or S phase. However, the degree of clinical benefit derived from these theoretical advantages in the treatment of prostate cancer has not been adequately determined. The present article reviews the available literature on the use of particle radiotherapy for prostate cancer as well as the literature on the physical and radiobiological properties of this treatment, and discusses the role and the relative merits of particle radiotherapy compared with current photon-based radiotherapy, with a focus on proton beam therapy and carbon ion radiotherapy",

abstract="PURPOSE: Following a thorough Phase I/II study, we evaluated by a Phase III trial high versus conventional dose external beam irradiation as mono-therapy for patients with Stage T3-T4 prostate cancer. Patient outcome following standard dose radiotherapy or following a 12.5\% increase in total dose to 75.6 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) using a conformal perineal proton boost was compared for local tumor control, disease-free survival, and overall survival. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Stage T3-T4, Nx, N0-2, M0 patients received 50.4 Gy by four-field photons and were randomized to receive either an additional 25.2 CGE by conformal protons (arm 1--the high dose arm, 103 patients, total dose 75.6 CGE) or an additional 16.8 Gy by photons (arm 2--the conventional dose arm, 99 patients, total dose 67.2 Gy). Actuarial overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), total recurrence-free survival (TRFS), (clinically free, prostate specific antigen (PSA) less than 4ng/ml and a negative prostate rebiopsy, done in 38 patients without evidence of disease) and local control (digital rectal exam and rebiopsy negative) were evaluated. RESULTS: The protocol completion rate was 90\% for arm 1 and 97\% for arm 2. With a median follow-up of 61 months (range 3 to 139 months) 135 patients are alive and 67 have died, 20 from causes other than prostate cancer. We found no significant differences in OS, DSS, TRFS or local control between the two arms. Among those completing randomized treatment (93 in arm 1 and 96 in arm 2), the local control at 5 and 8 years for arm 1 is 92\% and 77\%, respectively and is 80\% and 60\%, respectively for arm 2 (p = .089) and there are no significant differences in OS, DSS, and TRFS. The local control for the 57 patients with poorly differentiated (Gleason 4 or 5 of 5) tumors at 5 and 8 years for arm 1 is 94\% and 84\% and is 64\% and 19\% on arm 2 (p = 0.0014). In patients whose digital rectal exam had normalized following treatment and underwent prostate rebiopsy there was a lower positive rebiopsy rate for arm 1 versus arm 2 patients (28 vs. 45\%) and also for those with well and moderately differentiated tumors versus poorly differentiated tumors (32 and 50\%). These differences were not statistically significant. Grade 1 and 2 rectal bleeding is higher (32 vs. 12\%, p = 0.002) as may be urethral stricture (19 vs. 8\%, p = 0.07) in the arm 1 versus arm 2. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in prostate tumor dose by external beam of 12.5\% to 75.6 CGE by a conformal proton boost compared to a conventional dose of 67.2 Gy by a photon boost significantly improved local control only in patients with poorly differentiated tumors. It has increased late radiation sequelae, and as yet, has not increased overall survival, disease-specific survival, or total recurrence-free survival in any subgroup. These results have led us to test by a subsequent Phase III trial the potential beneficial effect on local control and disease-specific survival of a 12.5\% increase in total dose relative to conventional dose in patients with T1, T2a, and T2b tumors",

abstract="Purpose: To reduce uncertainty due to setup error and organ motion during radiotherapy of tumors in or near the lung, by means of real-time tumor tracking and gating of a linear accelerator.Methods and Materials: The real-time tumor-tracking system consists of four sets of diagnostic X-ray television systems (two of which offer an unobstructed view of the patient at any time), an image processor unit, a gating control unit, and an image display unit. The system recognizes the position of a 2.0-mm gold marker in the human body 30 times per second using two X-ray television systems. The marker is inserted in or near the tumor using image guided implantation. The linear accelerator is gated to irradiate the tumor only when the marker is within a given tolerance from its planned coordinates relative to the isocenter. The accuracy of the system and the additional dose due to the diagnostic X-ray were examined in a phantom, and the geometric performance of the system was evaluated in 4 patients.Results: The phantom experiment demonstrated that the geometric accuracy of the tumor-tracking system is better than 1.5 mm for moving targets up to a speed of 40 mm/s. The dose due to the diagnostic X-ray monitoring ranged from 0.01\% to 1\% of the target dose for a 2.0-Gy irradiation of a chest phantom. In 4 patients with lung cancer, the range of the coordinates of the tumor marker during irradiation was 2.5-5.3 mm, which would have been 9.6-38.4 mm without tracking.Conclusion: We successfully implemented and applied a tumor-tracking and gating system. The system significantly improves the accuracy of irradiation of targets in motion at the expense of an acceptable amount of diagnostic X-ray exposure",

abstract="PURPOSE: To examine the feasibility and reliability of insertion of internal fiducial markers into various organs for precise setup and real-time tumor tracking in radiotherapy (RT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Equipment and techniques for the insertion of 2.0-mm-diameter gold markers into or near the tumor were developed for spinal/paraspinal lesions, prostate tumors, and liver and lung tumors. Three markers were used to adjust the center of the mass of the target volume to the planned position in spinal/paraspinal lesions and prostate tumors (the three-marker method). The feasibility of the marker insertion and the stability of the position of markers were tested using stopping rules in the clinical protocol (i.e., the procedure was abandoned if 2 of 3 or 3 of 6 patients experienced marker dropping or migration). After the evaluation of the feasibility, the stability of the marker positions was monitored in those patients who entered the dose-escalation study. RESULTS: Each of the following was shown to be feasible: bronchoscopic insertion for the peripheral lung; image-guided transcutaneous insertion for the liver; cystoscopic and image-guided percutaneous insertion for the prostate; and surgical implantation for spinal/paraspinal lesions. Transcutaneous insertion of markers for spinal/paraspinal lesions and bronchoscopic insertion for central lung lesions were abandoned. Overall, marker implantation was successful and was used for real-time tumor tracking in RT in 90 (90\%) of 100 lesions. No serious complications related to the marker insertion were noted for any of the 100 lesions. Using three markers surgically implanted into the vertebral bone, the mean +/- standard deviation in distance among the three markers was within 0.2 +/- 0.6 mm (range -1.4 to 0.8) through the treatment period of 30 days. The distance between the three markers gradually decreased during RT in five of six prostate cancers, consistent with a mean rate of volume regression of 9.3\% (range 0.015-13\%) in 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: Internal 2.0-mm-diameter gold markers can be safely inserted into various organs for real-time tumor tracking in RT using the prescribed equipment and techniques. The three-marker method has been shown to be a useful technique for precise setup for spinal/paraspinal lesions and prostate tumors",

abstract="PurposeSynchronization of the techniques in real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy (RTRT) and intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) is expected to be useful for the treatment of tumors in motion. Our goal was to estimate the feasibility of the synchronization from the viewpoint of excessive dose resulting from the use of fluoroscopy.Methods and materialsUsing an ionization chamber for diagnostic X-rays, we measured the air kerma rate, surface dose with backscatter, and dose distribution in depth in a solid phantom from a fluoroscopic RTRT system. A nominal 50-120 kilovoltage peak (kVp) of X-ray energy and a nominal 1-4 ms of pulse width were used in the measurements.ResultsThe mean {\backslash}pm SD air kerma rate from one fluoroscope was 238.8 {\backslash}pm 0.54 mGy/h for a nominal pulse width of 2.0 ms and nominal 100 kVp of X-ray energy at the isocenter of the linear accelerator. The air kerma rate increased steeply with the increase in the X-ray beam energy. The surface dose was 28-980 mGy/h. The absorbed dose at a 5.0-cm depth in the phantom was 37-58\% of the peak dose. The estimated skin surface dose from one fluoroscope in RTRT was 29-1182 mGy/h and was strongly dependent on the kilovoltage peak and pulse width of the fluoroscope and slightly dependent on the distance between the skin and isocenter.ConclusionThe skin surface dose and absorbed depth dose resulting from fluoroscopy during RTRT can be significant if RTRT is synchronized with IMRT using a multileaf collimator. Precise estimation of the absorbed dose from fluoroscopy during RT and approaches to reduce the amount of exposure are mandatory",

To maximize gating efficiency, the patient?s position on the treatment couch was adjusted using the 4D setup system with fine on-line remote control of the treatment couch.Results: The trajectory of the marker detected in the 4D setup system was well visualized and used for daily setup. Various degrees of interfractional and intrafractional changes in the absolute amplitude and speed of the internal marker were detected. Readjustments were necessary during each treatment session, prompted by baseline shifting of the tumor position.Conclusion: The 4D setup system was shown to be useful for reducing the uncertainty of tumor motion and for increasing the efficiency of gated irradiation. Considering the interfractional and intrafractional changes in speed and amplitude detected in this study, intercepting radiotherapy is the safe and cost-effective method for 4D radiotherapy using real-time tracking technology",

For example, some radiation treatment planning systems now utilize CT data in heterogeneous dose calculations algorithms. In radiotherapy imaging applications, CT data are projected onto specified planes, thus producing ``radiographs,'' which are compared with simulator radiographs to assist in proper patient positioning and delineation of target volumes. All these applications share the common geometric problem of evaluating the radiological path through the CT array. Due to the complexity of the three-dimensional geometry and the enormous amount of CT data, the exact evaluation of the radiological path has proven to be a time consuming and difficult problem. This paper identifies the inefficient aspect of the traditional exact evaluation of the radiological path as that of treating the CT data as individual voxels. Rather than individual voxels, a new exact algorithm is presented that considers the CT data as consisting of the intersection volumes of three orthogonal sets of equally spaced, parallel planes. For a three-dimensional CT array of N3 voxels, the new exact algorithm scales with 3N, the number of planes, rather than N3, the number of voxels. Coded in FORTRAN-77 on a VAX 11/780 with a floating point option, the algorithm requires approximately 5 ms to calculate an average radiological path in a 100(3) voxel array",

abstract="This paper describes a method for 4D imaging, which is used to study respiratory organ motion, a key problem in various treatments. Whilst the commonly used imaging methods rely on simplified breathing patterns to acquire one breathing cycle, the proposed method was developed to study irregularities in organ motion during free breathing over tens of minutes. The method does not assume a constant breathing depth or even strict periodicity and does not depend on an external respiratory signal. Time-resolved 3D image sequences were reconstructed by retrospective stacking of dynamic 2D images using internal image-based sorting. The generic method is demonstrated for the liver and for the lung. Quantitative evaluations of the volume consistency show the advantages over one-dimensional measurements for image sorting. Dense deformation fields describing the respiratory motion were estimated from the reconstructed volumes using non-rigid 3D registration. All obtained motion fields showed variations in the range of minutes such as drifts and deformations, which changed both the exhalation position of the liver and the breathing pattern. The obtained motion data are used in proton therapy planning to evaluate dose delivery methodologies with respect to their motion sensitivity. Besides this application, the new possibilities of studying respiratory motion are valuable for other applications such as the evaluation of gating techniques with respect to residual motion",

abstract="This article shows the limitations of respiratory gating due to intrafraction deformations of the right liver lobe. The variability of organ shape and motion over tens of minutes was taken into account for this evaluation, which closes the gap between short-term analysis of a few regular cycles, as it is possible with 4DCT, and long-term analysis of interfraction motion. Time resolved MR volumes (4D MR sequences) were reconstructed for 12 volunteers and subsequent non-rigid registration provided estimates of the 3D trajectories of points within the liver over time. The full motion during free breathing and its distribution over the liver were quantified and respiratory gating was simulated to determine the gating accuracy for different gating signals, duty cycles, and different intervals between patient setup and treatment. Gating effectively compensated for the respiratory motion within short sequences (3 min), but deformations, mainly in the anterior inferior part (Couinaud segments IVb and V), led to systematic deviations from the setup position of more than 5 mm in 7 of 12 subjects after 20 min. We conclude that measurements over a few breathing cycles should not be used as a proof of accurate reproducibility of motion, not even within the same fraction, if it is longer than a few minutes. Although the diaphragm shows the largest magnitude of motion, it should not be used to assess the gating accuracy over the entire liver because the reproducibility is typically much more limited in inferior parts. Simple gating signals, such as the trajectory of skin motion, can detect the exhalation phase, but do not allow for an absolute localization of the complete liver over longer periods because the drift of these signals does not necessarily correlate with the internal drift",

abstract="The influence of antiscatter x-ray grids on image quality in cone-beam computed tomography (CT) is evaluated through broad experimental investigation for various anatomical sites (head and body), scatter conditions (scatter-to-primary ratio (SPR) ranging from approximately 10\% to 150\%), patient dose, and spatial resolution in three-dimensional reconstructions. Studies involved linear grids in combination with a flat-panel imager on a system for kilovoltage cone-beam CT imaging and guidance of radiation therapy. Grids were found to be effective in reducing x-ray scatter ``cupping'' artifacts, with heavier grids providing increased image uniformity. The system was highly robust against ring artifacts that might arise in CT reconstructions as a result of gridline shadows in the projection data. The influence of grids on soft-tissue detectability was evaluated quantitatively in terms of absolute contrast, voxel noise, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in cone-beam CT reconstructions of 16 cm ``head'' and 32 cm ``body'' cylindrical phantoms. Imaging performance was investigated qualitatively in observer preference tests based on patient images (pelvis, abdomen, and head-and-neck sites) acquired with and without antiscatter grids. The results suggest that although grids reduce scatter artifacts and improve subject contrast, there is little strong motivation for the use of grids in cone-beam CT in terms of CNR and overall image quality under most circumstances. The results highlight the tradeoffs in contrast and noise imparted by grids, showing improved image quality with grids only under specific conditions of high x-ray scatter (SPR> 100\%), high imaging dose (Dcenter> 2 cGy), and low spatial resolution (voxel size > or = 1 mm)",

Variations of volume of a breathing phantom was used as an indicator.Methods and Materials: A balloon was periodically inflated and deflated by a medical ventilator. The volume variation (\&\#x0394;V) of the balloon was measured simultaneously by a spirometer, taken as reference, and by contouring 4D-CT series (10 phases) acquired by the real-time position management system (RPM). Similar cross-comparison was performed for 2 lung patients, 1 with free breathing (FB), the other with deep-inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) technique.Results: During FB, \&\#x0394;V measured by the spirometer and from 4D-CT were in good agreement: the mean differences for all phases were 8.1 mL for the balloon and 10.5 mL for a patient-test. End-inspiration lung volume has been shown to be slightly underestimated by the 4D-CT. The discrepancy for \$?

abstract="BACKGROUND: The role and optimum dose of radiation to eradicate prostate cancer continues to be evaluated. Protons offer an opportunity to increase the radiation dose to the prostate while minimizing treatment toxicity. METHODS: Six hundred forty-three patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with protons, with or without photons. Treatments were planned with a 3D planning system; patients received 74-75 CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent) at 1.8-2.0 CGE per fraction. Patients were evaluated for response to therapy and treatment-related toxicity. RESULTS: The overall clinical disease-free survival rate was 89\% at 5 years. When post-treatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was used as an endpoint for disease control, the 4.5-year disease-free survival rate was 100\% for patients with an initial PSA of < 4.0 ng/ml, and 89\%, 72\%, and 53\% for patients with initial PSA levels of 4.1-10.0, 10.1-20.0, and > 20.0, respectively. Patients in whom the post-treatment PSA nadir was below 0.5 ng/ml did significantly better than those whose nadir values were between 0.51-1.0 or > 1.0 ng/ml: the corresponding 5-year disease-free survival rates were 91\%, 79\%, and 40\%, respectively. Minimal radiation proctitis was seen in 21\% of patients; toxicity of greater severity was seen in less than 1\%. CONCLUSION: Proton therapy to 74-75 CGE produced minimal treatment-related toxicity and excellent PSA normalization and disease-free survival in patients with low initial PSA levels. A prospective randomized dose-escalation trial is now underway to help define the optimum dose of radiation for patients with early stage prostate cancer",

abstract="Field-specific apertures, of sufficient range-absorbing thickness, are used in the majority of proton-therapy treatments today. In current practice, these apertures are modelled as objects of infinitesimal thickness. Such an approximation, however, is not accurate if the aperture edge is close to, or extends over, the beam axis. Practical situations in which this occurs include off-axis patch fields, small apertures, and fields shaped with a multileaf collimator. We develop an extension of the pencil-beam dose model to incorporate the aperture thickness. We derive an exact solution as well as a computationally simpler approximate implementation. The model is validated using measurements of the lateral penumbra. For a set-up with a source size of 2.76 cm, a source-to-axis distance of 227 cm, and a aperture-to-axis distance of 35 cm, the maximum increase in penumbra for a 6 cm thick aperture compared to the thin-aperture model is about 2 mm. The maximum shift in the 95\% isodose contour line is larger. The overall effect depends on the aperture thickness, the position of the aperture edge and the intrinsic source size and SAD, but is fairly insensitive to aperture-to-skin distance and depth in patient",

Some of their aspects, however, have been questioned, like patient's tolerance and their value in modern high-precision radiotherapy. This paper gives an overview of published data concerning ERB application in prostate radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Systematic literature review based on PubMed/MEDLINE database searches. RESULTS: Overall, ERBs are tolerated well, although patients with pre-existing anorectal disease have an increased risk of developing ERB-related toxicity. Planning studies show reduced Rwall and anal wall (Awall) doses with ERB application. Clinical data, however, are scarce, as only one study shows reduced late rectal damage. There is no consensus about the immobilizing properties of ERBs and it is recommended to use additional set-up and correction protocols, especially because there are potential pitfalls. CONCLUSION: ERBs seem well-tolerated and in planning studies reduce anorectal wall doses. This may lead to reduced anorectal toxicity, although clinical studies are warranted to confirm this hypothesis and to further investigate the immobilizing properties of ERBs, preferably in combination with advanced techniques for position verification",

The data from these measurements were used to evaluate variation from setup between treatment days and motion due to respiration and/or patient movement during treatment delivery.Results: The effect of respiratory motion and movement during treatment was minimal: the maximum range in CLD for any patient on any day was 0.25 cm. The variation caused by day-to-day setup variation was greater, with CLD values for patients ranging from 0.59 cm to 2.94 cm. Similar findings were found for heart and lung areas.Conclusions: There is very little change in CLD and corresponding lung and heart area during individual radiation treatment fractions in breast tangential fields, compared with a relatively greater amount of variation that occurs between days",

abstract="PURPOSE: With higher radiation dose, higher cure rates have been reported in prostate cancer patients. The extra margin needed to account for prostate motion, however, limits the level of dose escalation, because of the presence of surrounding organs at risk. Knowledge of the precise position of the prostate would allow significant reduction of the treatment field. Better localization of the prostate at the time of treatment is therefore needed, e.g. using a cone-beam computed tomography (CT) system integrated with the linear accelerator. Localization of the prostate relies upon manual delineation of contours in successive axial CT slices or interactive alignment and is fairly time-consuming. A faster method is required for on-line or off-line image-guided radiotherapy, because of prostate motion, for patient throughput and efficiency. Therefore, we developed an automatic method to localize the prostate, based on 3D gray value registration. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A study was performed on conventional repeat CT scans of 19 prostate cancer patients to develop the methodology to localize the prostate. For each patient, 8-13 repeat CT scans were made during the course of treatment. First, the planning CT scan and the repeat CT scan were registered onto the rigid bony structures. Then, the delineated prostate in the planning CT scan was enlarged by an optimum margin of 5 mm to define a region of interest in the planning CT scan that contained enough gray value information for registration. Subsequently, this region was automatically registered to a repeat CT scan using 3D gray value registration to localize the prostate. The performance of automatic prostate localization was compared to prostate localization using contours. Therefore, a reference set was generated by registering the delineated contours of the prostates in all scans of all patients. Gray value registrations that showed large differences with respect to contour registrations were detected with a chi(2) analysis and were removed from the data set before further analysis. RESULTS: Comparing gray value registration to contour registration, we found a success rate of 91\%. The accuracy for rotations around the left-right, cranial-caudal, and anterior-posterior axis was 2.4 degrees, 1.6 degrees, and 1.3 degrees (1 SD), respectively, and for translations along these axes 0.7, 1.3, and 1.2 mm (1 SD), respectively. A large part of the error is attributed to uncertainty in the reference contour set. Automatic prostate localization takes about 45 seconds on a 1.7 GHz Pentium IV personal computer. CONCLUSIONS: This newly developed method localizes the prostate quickly, accurately, and with a good success rate, although visual inspection is still needed to detect outliers. With this approach, it will be possible to correct on-line or off-line for prostate movement. Combined with the conformity of intensity-modulated dose distributions, this method might permit dose escalation beyond that of current conformal approaches, because margins can be safely reduced",

abstract="PURPOSE: Previously, we developed an automatic three-dimensional gray-value registration (GR) method for fast prostate localization that could be used during online or offline image-guided radiotherapy. The method was tested on conventional computed tomography (CT) scans. In this study, the performance of the algorithm to localize the prostate on cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans acquired on the treatment machine was evaluated. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Five to 17 CBCT scans of 32 prostate cancer patients (332 scans in total) were used. For 18 patients (190 CBCT scans), the CBCT scans were acquired with a collimated field of view (FOV) (craniocaudal). This procedure improved the image quality considerably. The prostate (i.e., prostate plus seminal vesicles) in each CBCT scan was registered to the prostate in the planning CT scan by automatic 3D gray-value registration (normal GR) starting from a registration on the bony anatomy. When these failed, registrations were repeated with a fixed rotation point locked at the prostate apex (fixed apex GR). Registrations were visually assessed in 3D by one observer with the help of an expansion (by 3.6 mm) of the delineated prostate contours of the planning CT scan. The percentage of successfully registered cases was determined from the combined normal and fixed apex GR assessment results. The error in gray-value registration for both registration methods was determined from the position of one clearly defined calcification in the prostate gland (9 patients, 71 successful registrations). RESULTS: The percentage of successfully registered CBCT scans that were acquired with a collimated FOV was about 10\% higher than for CBCT scans that were acquired with an uncollimated FOV. For CBCT scans that were acquired with a collimated FOV, the percentage of successfully registered cases improved from 65\%, when only normal GR was applied, to 83\% when the results of normal and fixed apex GR were combined. Gray-value registration mainly failed (or registrations were difficult to assess) because of streaks in the CBCT scans caused by moving gas pockets in the rectum during CBCT image acquisition (i.e., intrafraction motion). The error in gray-value registration along the left-right, craniocaudal, and anteroposterior axes was 1.0, 2.4, and 2.3 mm (1 SD) for normal GR, and 1.0, 2.0, and 1.7 mm (1 SD) for fixed apex GR. The systematic and random components of these SDs contributed approximately equally to these SDs, for both registration methods. CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility of automatic prostate localization on CBCT scans acquired on the treatment machine using an adaptation of the previously developed three-dimensional gray-value registration algorithm, has been validated in this study. Collimating the FOV during CBCT image acquisition improved the CBCT image quality considerably. Artifacts in the CBCT images caused by large moving gas pockets during CBCT image acquisition were the main cause for unsuccessful registration. From this study, we can conclude that CBCT scans are suitable for online and offline position verification of the prostate, as long as the amount of nonstationary gas is limited",

abstract="NIST has been a pioneer in the use of radiochromic film for medical dosimetry applications. Beginning in 1988 with experiments with (90)Sr/Y ophthalmic applicators, this work has continued into the present. A review of the latest applications is presented, which include high activity low-energy photon source dosimetry and ultra-high resolution film densitometry for dose enhancement near stents and microbeam radiation therapy dosimetry. An exciting recent development is the availability of a new radiochromic emulsion which has been developed for IMRT dosimetry. This emulsion is an order of magnitude more sensitive than was previously available. Measurements of the sensitivity and uniformity of samples of this new film are reported, using a spectrophotometer and two scanning laser densitometers. A unique feature of the new emulsion is that the peak of the absorbance spectrum falls at the wavelength of the HeNe lasers used in the densitometer, maximising sensitivity. When read at a wavelength of 633 nm, sensitivities on the order of 900 mAU Gy(-1) were determined for this new film type, compared with about 40 mAU Gy(-1) for type HS film, 20 mAU Gy(-1) for type MD-55-2 film, and 3 mAU Gy(-1) for type HD-810. Film uniformities were found to be good, on the order of 6\% peak to peak. However, there is a strong polarisation effect in the samples examined, requiring care in film orientation during readout",

Therefore, the need arises to compute the comprehensive biological effect or physical figure of merit of the combined dose of a number of distinct geometry instances. For that purpose the dose is typically accumulated in a reference geometry through deformation fields obtained from deformable image registration. However, it is difficult to establish precise voxel-by-voxel relationships between different anatomical images in many cases. In this work, the mathematical properties of commonly used score functions are exploited to derive an upper boundary for the maximum effect for normal tissue and a lower boundary for the minimum effect for the target of accumulated doses on multiple geometry instances",

abstract="PURPOSE: Because efficacy of lung cancer screening using chest x-ray is controversial and insufficient, other screening modalities need to be developed. To provide data on screening performance of low-dose helical computed tomography (CT) scanning and its efficacy in terms of survival, a one-arm longitudinal screening project was conducted. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1,611 asymptomatic patients aged 40 to 79 years, 86\% with smoking history, were screened by low-dose helical CT scan, chest x-ray, and 3-day pooled sputum cytology with a 6-month interval. RESULTS: At initial screening, the proportions of positive tests were 11.5\%, 3.4\%, and 0.8\% with low-dose helical CT scan, chest x-ray, and sputum cytology, respectively. In 1,611 participants, 14 (0.87\%) cases of lung cancer were detected, with 71\% being stage IA disease and a mean tumor diameter of 19.8 mm. At repeated screening, the proportions of positive tests were 9.1\%, 2.6\%, and 0.7\% with low-dose helical CT, chest x-ray, and sputum cytology, respectively. In 7,891 examinations, 22 (0.28\%) cases of lung cancer were detected, with 82\% being stage IA disease and a mean tumor diameter of 14.6 mm. The 5-year survival rate for screen-detected lung cancer was 76.2\% and 64.9\% for initial and repeated screening, respectively. CONCLUSION: Screening with low-dose helical CT has potential to improve screening efficacy in terms of reducing lung cancer mortality. An evaluation of efficacy using appropriate methods is urgently required",

abstract="In patients undergoing radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer, dose-volume histograms and clinical variables were examined to search for correlations between radiation treatment planning parameters and late rectal bleeding. We analyzed 129 patients with localized prostate cancer who were managed from 2002 to 2010 at our institution. They were treated with 3D conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT, 70 Gy/35 fractions, 55 patients) or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT, 76 Gy/38 fractions, 74 patients). All radiation treatment plans were retrospectively reconstructed, dose-volume histograms of the rectum were generated, and the doses delivered to the rectum were calculated. Time to rectal bleeding ranged from 9-53 months, with a median of 18.7 months. Of the 129 patients, 33 patients had Grade 1 bleeding and were treated with steroid suppositories, while 25 patients with Grade 2 bleeding received argon plasma laser coagulation therapy (APC). Three patients with Grade 3 bleeding required both APC and blood transfusion. The 5-year incidence rate of Grade 2 or 3 rectal bleeding was 21.8\% for the 3D-CRT group and 21.6\% for the IMRT group. Univariate analysis showed significant differences in the average values from V65 to V10 between Grades 0-1 and Grades 2-3. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that patients with V65 >/= 17\% had a significantly increased risk (P = 0.032) of Grade 2 or 3 rectal bleeding. Of the 28 patients of Grade 2 or 3 rectal bleeding, 17 patients (60.7\%) were cured by a single session of APC, while the other 11 patients required two sessions. Thus, none of the patients had any further rectal bleeding after the second APC session",

abstract="PURPOSE: To quantify the localization accuracy and intrafraction stability of lung cancer patients treated with frameless, four-dimensional (4D) cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and to calculate and validate planning target volume (PTV) margins to account for the residual geometric uncertainties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-five patients with small peripheral lung tumors were treated with SBRT without a body frame to 54 Gy in three fractions. For each fraction, three 4D-CBCT scans were acquired: before treatment to measure and correct the time-weighted mean tumor position, after correction to validate the correction applied, and after treatment to estimate the intrafraction stability. Patient-specific PTV margins were computed and subsequently validated using Monte Carlo error simulations. RESULTS: Systematic tumor localization inaccuracies (1 SD) were 0.8, 0.8, and 0.9 mm for the left-right, craniocaudal, and anteroposterior direction, respectively. Random localization inaccuracies were 1.1, 1.1, and 1.4 mm. Baseline variations were 1.8, 2.9, and 3.0 mm (systematic) and 1.1, 1.5, and 2.0 mm (random), indicating the importance of image guidance. Intrafraction stability of the target was 1.2, 1.2, and 1.8 mm (systematic) and 1.3, 1.5, and 1.8 mm (random). Monte Carlo error simulations showed that patient-specific PTV margins (5.8-10.5 mm) were adequate for 94\% of the evaluated cases (2-28 mm peak-to-peak breathing amplitude). CONCLUSIONS: Frameless SBRT can be safely administered using 4D-CBCT guidance. Even with considerable breathing motion, the PTV margins can safely be kept small, allowing patients with larger tumors to benefit from the advantages of SBRT. In case bony anatomy would be used as a surrogate for tumor position, considerably larger PTV margins would be required",

abstract="PURPOSE: To quantify the interfractional variability in lung tumor trajectory and mean position during the course of radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Repeat four-dimensional (4D) cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans (median, nine scans/patient) routinely acquired during the course of treatment were analyzed for 56 patients with lung cancer. Tumor motion was assessed by using local rigid registration of a region of interest in the 3D planning CT to each phase in the 4D CBCT. Displacements of the mean tumor position relative to the planned position (baseline variations) were obtained by using time-weighted averaging of the motion curve. RESULTS: The tumor trajectory shape was found to be stable interfractionally, with mean variability not exceeding 1 mm (1 SD) in each direction for the inhale and exhale phases. Interfractional baseline variations, however, were large, with 1.6- (left-right), 3.9- (cranial-caudal), and 2.8-mm (anterior-posterior) systematic variations (1 SD) and 1.2- (left-right), 2.4- (cranial-caudal) and 2.2-mm (anterior-posterior) random variations. Eliminating baseline variations by using soft-tissue guidance decreases planning target volume margins by approximately 50\% compared with bony anatomy-driven protocols for conventional fractionation schemes. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic and random baseline variations constitute a substantial portion of the geometric variability present in the treatment of patients with lung cancer and require generous safety margins when relying on accurate setup/immobilization or bony anatomy-driven correction strategies. The 4D-CBCT has the ability to accurately monitor tumor trajectory shape and baseline variations and drive image-guided correction strategies that allows safe margin reduction",

abstract="Lung cancer radiation therapy (RT) is associated with complex geometrical uncertainties, such as respiratory motion, differential baseline shifts between primary tumor and involved lymph nodes, and anatomical changes due to treatment response. Generous safety margins required to account for these uncertainties limit the potential of dose escalation to improve treatment outcome. Four dimensional inverse planning incorporating pretreatment patient-specific respiratory motion information into the treatment plan already improves treatment plan quality. More importantly, repetitive imaging during treatment quantifies patient-specific intrafraction, interfraction, and progressive geometrical variations. These patient-specific parameters subsequently can drive adaptive plan modification correcting for systematic errors while incorporating random errors. Adaptive RT therefore has the potential to considerably improve the accuracy of RT, reducing the exposure of organs at risk, facilitating safe dose escalation, and improving local control as well as overall survival",

abstract="Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) can be used to measure and correct positional errors for target and critical structures immediately prior to or during treatment delivery. Some of the most recent available methods applied for target localization are: transabdominal ultrasound, implanted markers with in room MV or kV X-rays, optical surface tracking systems, implantable electromagnetic markers, in room CT such as kVCT on rail, kilovoltage or megavoltage cone-beam CT (CBCT) and helical megavoltage CT. The verification of the accurate treatment position in conjunction with detailed anatomical information before every fraction can be essential for the outcome of the treatment. In this paper we present the on-board imager (OBI, Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) that has been in routine clinical use at the Karolinska University Hospital since June 2004. The OBI has been used for on-line set-up correction of prostate patients using internal gold markers. Displacements of these markers can be monitored radiographically during the treatment course and the registered marker shifts act as a surrogate for prostate motion. For this purpose, on-board kV-kV seems to be an ideal system in terms of image quality. The CBCT function of OBI was installed in March 2005 at our department. It focuses on localizing tumors based on internal anatomy, not just on the conventional external marks or tattoos. The CBCT system provides the capacity for soft tissue imaging in the treatment position and real-time radiographic monitoring during treatment delivery",

abstract="PURPOSE: Intensity-modulated radiotherapy with photons (IMRT) and protons (IMPT) produces dose distributions that have high conformality to the planning target volume and sufficient sparing of the organs at risk if calculated on a single static computed tomography (CT) scan. For prostate cancer patients, organ movement with related changes to the density distribution in the irradiated volume occurs during the treatment course. We evaluated the sensitivity of IMPT and IMRT plans to organ movement. METHODS AND MATERIALS: IMPT and IMRT treatment plans were evaluated for 4 patients with an average of 16 CT data sets per patient. The treatment plans were recalculated on all treatment CT scans, and the dose was accumulated in the reference geometry using a deformable registration algorithm. Accurate dose calculation methods were applied for both IMPT and IMRT. RESULTS: With IMPT, unacceptably low total doses in the gross tumor volume were observed for patients with gas in the rectum on the planning CT scan. To achieve a total equivalent uniform dose (EUD) and EUD spread similar to that with IMRT, two methods were crucial for IMPT-a rectal gas water-equivalent density overwrite in the original planning CT scan and initial beam weight setting to achieve a homogeneous dose distribution for the whole planning target volume for each field separately. An improvement in the total EUD for the prostate and rectal wall was also observed for IMRT with the water-equivalent density overwrite of the rectal cavities. CONCLUSION: The sensitivities of IMPT and IMRT to organ movement are of the same order if appropriate planning strategies are applied. The latter is especially crucial for IMPT",

volume="50",

pages="5893--5908",
abstract="We present a method of modelling inter-fractional organ deformation and correlated motion of adjacent organ structures in terms of so-called eigenmodes. The method is based on a principal component analysis (PCA) of organ shapes and allows for reducing the large dimensionality of geometry information from multiple CT studies to a few-parametric statistical model of organ motion and deformation. Eigenmodes are 3D vectorfields of correlated displacements of the organ surface points and can be seen as fundamental \&lsquo;modes\&rsquo; of the patient?s geometric variability. The amount of variability represented by the eigenmodes is quantified in terms of corresponding eigenvalues. Weighted sums of eigenmodes describe organ displacements/deformations and can be used to generate new organ geometries. We applied the method to four patient datasets of prostate/rectum/bladder with N = 15\&ndash;18 CTs to assess interfractional geometric variation. The spectrum of eigenvalues was found to be dominated by only few values, indicating that the geometric variability of prostate/bladder/rectum is governed by only few patient specific eigenmodes. We evaluated the capability of this approach to represent the measured organ samples by calculating the residual errors for the organ surface points, using a varying number of eigenmodes. The distribution of residual errors shows fast convergence with the number of eigenmodes. Using 4 dominating modes, the range of residual errors for the four patients was 1.3\&ndash;2.0 mm (prostate), 1.4\&ndash;1.9 mm (rectum) and 1.5\&ndash;1.9 mm (bladder). Thus, individual geometric variation taken from multiple imaging data can be described accurately by few dominating eigenmodes, thereby providing the most important factors to characterize deformable organ motion, which can assist adaptive radiotherapy planning",

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate a deformable image registration (DIR) segmentation technique for semi-automating ITV production from 4DCT for lung patients, in terms of accuracy and efficiency. METHODS: Twenty-five stereotactic body radiotherapy lung patients were selected in this retrospective study. ITVs were manually delineated by an oncologist and semi-automatically produced by propagating the GTV manually delineated on the mid-ventilation phase to all other phases using two different DIR algorithms, using commercial software. The two ITVs produced by DIR were compared to the manually delineated ITV using the dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean distance between agreement and normalised DSC. DIR-produced ITVs were assessed for their clinical suitability and also the time savings were estimated. RESULTS: Eighteen out of 25 ITVs had normalised DSC>1 indicating an agreement with the manually produced ITV within 1mm uncertainty. Four of the other seven ITVs were deemed clinically acceptable and three would require a small amount of editing. In general, ITVs produced by DIR were smoother than those produced by manual delineation. It was estimated that using this technique would save clinicians on average 28min/patient. CONCLUSIONS: ABAS was found to be a useful tool in the production of ITVs for lung patients. The ITVs produced are either immediately clinically acceptable or require minimal editing. This approach represents a significant time saving for clinicians",

abstract="PURPOSE: To determine interfractional reproducibility of the location of lung tumors using respiratory motion mitigation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Free-breathing four-dimensional computed tomography (CT) data sets and CT data sets during breath hold were acquired weekly for 17 patients undergoing treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer. Distances between the center of the gross tumor volume (GTV) and a reproducible bony reference point under conditions of breath hold on end inspiration (EI) and end expiration (EE) and during free breathing on the 0\% phase (corresponding to EI) and 50\% phase (corresponding to EE) were analyzed for interfractional reproducibility. Systematic uncertainties in tumor location were determined as the difference in distance between the GTV center on the first CT data set and the mean location of GTV centers on the subsequent data sets. Random uncertainties in tumor location were determined as the standard deviation of the distances between the GTV centers and the bony reference points. Margins to account for systematic and random interfractional variations were estimated based on these uncertainties. RESULTS: Mean values of interfractional setup uncertainties were as follows: systematic uncertainties--EI, 0.3 cm; EE, 0.2 cm; 0\% phase, 0.3 cm; and 50\% phase, 0.3 cm; and random uncertainties--EI, 0.3 cm; EE, 0.3 cm; 0\% phase, 0.3 cm; and 50\% phase, 0.3 cm. There does not appear to be any correlation between uncertainties and GTV size, but there appears to be a weak positive correlation between uncertainties and the magnitude of GTV excursion. CONCLUSIONS: Voluntary breath hold and gating on either EI or EE appear to be equally reliable methods of ensuring the reproducibility of lung tumor position. We recommend setup margins of 0.3 cm if using cone-beam CT or kilovoltage X-ray with fiducials and aligning directly to the tumor and 0.8 cm when aligning to a nearby bony surrogate using cone-beam CT or kilovoltage X-ray",

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of rectum motion on dose - volume histograms of the rectum including filling and of the wall (DVH and DWH, respectively), during 3D-conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) for localized prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients received a planning CT scan (CT(0)) and 11-14 CT during 3DCRT for prostate cancer (total CT scans=126). CT images were 3D matched using bony anatomy. A single observer drew the external contours of rectum and rectum wall and the CTV (prostate + seminal vesicles) on CT(0). Patients were asked to empty their rectum before every CT, as generally performed at the Institute for Cancer Research and Treatment (IRCC) before treatment delivery. Bladder was kept full by drinking 500 cm(3) of water 60 min before the scan, according to our protocol. A 4-field box 3DCRT technique was planned and dose statistics/dose - volume histograms of the rectum were calculated for each contour referred to CT(0),CT(1),...,CT(n) for each patient. Average DVHs during treatment were calculated along with their standard deviation (SD(rand)) and compared to the planned DVH. The analyses on the patient population included the assessment of systematic deviation (average difference and SD, named SD(sys)) as well as the average SD(rand) value expressing the random component of organ motion. Rectum shifts were also assessed by anterior and lateral BEV projections. RESULTS: As to the rectum, 8/10 patients showed a ``better'' average DVH than DVH on CT(0). Wilcoxon test showed a statistically significant reduction when correlating the difference Delta between the average DVH during therapy and planning DVH at CT(0): for instance V(70)Delta = -3.6\% and p = 0.022, V(50)Delta = -5.5\% and p = 0.022, D(med)Delta = -3.2 Gy and p = 0.007. Average values of DVH systematic difference (average difference between planning scan and treatment), standard deviations (SD(sys)) and average standard deviations of the random fluctuation (SD(random)) were -4.0\%, 4.7\% and 6.6\%, respectively. Whilst the fluctuation results were slightly smaller for DWH. Volume analysis showed a slight systematic variation of the rectal volume between planning and treatment BEV. The average rectal volume during therapy was larger than at the planning CT in 8/10 patients. The systematic shifts of the rectal wall between the planning phase and the treatment were rather small, both below and above the flexure. The larger random fluctuation of the rectum shape was found to be in the cranial half (1 SD=4.4 mm). CONCLUSIONS: The practice of carefully emptying the rectum during simulation and therapy for prostate cancer, which is a safe and simple procedure, reduces the impact of organ motion on dose - volume parameters of the rectum",

abstract="Gating is one option for radiotherapy of tumours that move intrafractionally due to respiration. Delays of the motion monitoring system can lead to a shift of the gating window and thus slightly shifted dose distributions. We studied the delay of two motion monitoring systems which use the motion of the chest wall as surrogate for tumour motion. Delays and their dosimetric influence were determined against a precise motion acquisition system in a phantom study. The measurement data were supplemented by dedicated simulations of the experimental setup. Finally, the dosimetric influence for patient treatments was estimated for a lung tumour case using the extreme situation of a radiosurgery setting with a single field. We determined delays of 132 +/- 18 ms and 103 +/- 22 ms for the two systems. There was no significant difference between beam start and beam stop delay. Even for delays of 200 ms the dosimetric influence in a single-field radiosurgery setting is moderate (V95 = 96.5\%, V107 = 8.5\%, D5-D95 = 13\%). We conclude, that the delay of the motion monitoring system should be part of the commissioning process for gated treatments. The dosimetric impact should be studied in detail prior treatments with a scanned ion beam",

abstract="The use of Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) in Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) has become increasingly feasible and popular in recent years. Advances and developments in Flat-Panel Imager (FPI) technology and image reconstruction software allow for linac-mounted 3D CBCT imaging. Taking CBCT images on a daily/weekly basis, offers the possibility to guide the treatment beam according to tumour motion and to apply changes to the treatment plan if necessary. This however raises the issue of additional imaging dose and thus increases in secondary cancer risk. The performance characteristics of kV-CBCT and MV-CBCT solutions currently offered by Elekta, Siemens and Varian are compared in this paper in terms of additional imaging dose and image quality. The review also outlines applications of CBCT for IGRT and Adaptive Radiotherapy (ART). As CBCT is not the only in-room IGRT platform, helical MV-CT (Tomotherapy) and in-room CT designs are also presented",

abstract="PURPOSE: A method was developed to convert clinically prescribed RBE (Relative Biological Effectiveness)-weighted doses from the approach used at the Heavy-Ion Medical Accelerator (HIMAC) at the National Institute of Radiological Science, Chiba, Japan, to the LEM (Local Effect Model)-based TReatment planning for Particles (TRiP98) approach used in the pilot project at the GSI Helmholtzzentrum, Darmstadt, and the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center (HIT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: The proposed conversion method is based on a simulation of the fixed spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) depth dose profiles as used for the irradiation at HIMAC by LEM/TRiP98 and a recalculation of the resulting RBE-weighted dose distribution. We present data according to the clinical studies conducted at GSI in the past decade (LEM I), as well as data used in current studies (refined LEM version: LEM IV). RESULTS: We found conversion factors (RBE-weighted dose LEM/RBE-weighted dose HIMAC) reaching from 0.4 to 2.0 for prescribed carbon ion doses from 1 to 60 Gy (RBE) for SOBP extensions ranging from 20 to 120 mm according to the HIMAC approach. A conversion factor of 1.0 was found for approximately 5 Gy (RBE). The conversion factor decreases with increasing prescribed dose. Slightly smaller values for the LEM IV-based data set compared with LEM I were found. A significant dependence of the conversion factor from the SOBP width could be observed in particular for LEM IV, whereas the depth dependence was found to be small. CONCLUSIONS: For the interpretation and comparison of clinical trials performed at HIMAC and GSI/HIT, it is of extreme importance to consider these conversion factors because according to the various methods to determine the RBE-weighted dose, similar dose values might not necessarily be related to similar clinical outcomes",

abstract="A 3-D radiation therapy treatment planning system calculates dose to an entire volume of points and therefore requires a 3-D distribution of measured dose values for quality assurance and dose calculation verification. To measure such a volumetric distribution with a scanning ion chamber is prohibitively time consuming. A method is presented for the generation of a 3-D grid of dose values based on beam's-eye-view (BEV) film dosimetry. For each field configuration of interest, a set of BEV films at different depths is obtained and digitized, and the optical densities are converted to dose. To reduce inaccuracies associated with film measurement of megavoltage photon depth doses, doses on the different planes are normalized using an ion-chamber measurement of the depth dose. A 3-D grid of dose values is created by interpolation between BEV planes along divergent beam rays. This matrix of measurement-based dose values can then be compared to calculations over the entire volume of interest. This method is demonstrated for three different field configurations. Accuracy of the film-measured dose values is determined by 1-D and 2-D comparisons with ion chamber measurements. Film and ion chamber measurements agree within 2\% in the central field regions and within 2.0 mm in the penumbral regions",

abstract="PURPOSE: To determine whether superior-inferior lung tumor motion is predictable by tumor size or location, or pulmonary function test results. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Superior-inferior tumor motion was measured on orthogonal radiographs taken during simulation of 22 patients with inoperable lung cancer diagnosed by orthogonal radiographs. RESULTS: The tumor size averaged 5.5 +/- 3.1 cm (range 1.5-12 cm). Seven of 11 central tumors demonstrated some motion compared with 5 of 11 peripheral tumors. Four of 5 upper lobe tumors moved compared with 8 of 17 tumors that were either middle or lower lobe lesions. The mean fourth rib motion was 7.3 +/- 3.2 mm (range 2-15). The mean FeV(1) was 1.8 +/- 1.2 (range 0.55-5.33. The mean diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide was 14.0 +/- 6.5 (range 7.8-21.9). The mean total lung capacity was 6.5 +/- 1.2 (range 3.3-8.4). None of these parameters correlated with tumor motion. Although lateral tumor motion could not be consistently determined, 1 tumor moved 10 mm anterior-posteriorly. CONCLUSIONS: Lung tumors often move significantly during respiration. Tumor motion is not predictable by tumor size or location, or pulmonary function test results. Therefore, tumor motion must be measured in all patients. Measurement in three dimensions will likely be necessary to maximize the irradiated lung volumes or choose beam arrangements parallel to the major axis of motion",

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate stereotactic positioning uncertainties of patients with paraspinal tumors treated with fractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy; and to determine whether target-point correction via rigid registration is sufficient for daily patient positioning. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients with tumors at the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine received regular control computed-tomography (CT) scans using an in-room CT scanner. All patients were immobilized with the combination of Scotch cast torso and head masks. The positioning was evaluated regarding translational and rotational errors by applying a rigid registration algorithm based on mutual information. The registration box was fitted to the target volume for optimal registration in the high-dose area. To evaluate the suitability of the rigid registration result for correcting the target volume position we subsequently registered three small subsections of the upper, middle, and lower target volume. The resulting residual deviations reflect the extent of the elastic deformations, which cannot be covered by the rigid-body registration procedure. RESULTS: A total of 321 control CT scans were evaluated. The rotational errors were negligible. Translational errors were smallest for cervical tumors (-0.1 +/- 1.1, 0.3 +/- 0.8, and 0.1 +/- 0.9 mm along left-right, anterior-posterior, and superior-inferior axes), followed by thoracic (0.8 +/- 1.1, 0.3 +/- 0.8, and 1.1 +/- 1.3 mm) and lumbar tumors (-0.7 +/- 1.3, 0.0 +/- 0.9, and 0.5 +/- 1.6 mm). The residual deviations of the three subsections were <1 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The applied stereotactic patient setup resulted in small rotational errors. However, considerable translational positioning errors may occur; thus, on the basis of these data daily control CT scans are recommended. Rigid transformation is adequate for correcting the target volume position",

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate the setup, interfraction, and intrafraction organ motion error distributions and simulate intrafraction intervention strategies for prostate radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 17 patients underwent treatment setup and were monitored using the Calypso system during radiotherapy. On average, the prostate tracking measurements were performed for 8 min/fraction for 28 fractions for each patient. For both patient couch shift data and intrafraction organ motion data, the systematic and random errors were obtained from the patient population. The planning target volume margins were calculated using the van Herk formula. Two intervention strategies were simulated using the tracking data: the deviation threshold and period. The related planning target volume margins, time costs, and prostate position ``fluctuation'' were presented. RESULTS: The required treatment margin for the left-right, superoinferior, and anteroposterior axes was 8.4, 10.8, and 14.7 mm for skin mark-only setup and 1.3, 2.3, and 2.8 mm using the on-line setup correction, respectively. Prostate motion significantly correlated among the superoinferior and anteroposterior directions. Of the 17 patients, 14 had prostate motion within 5 mm of the initial setup position for >/=91.6\% of the total tracking time. The treatment margin decreased to 1.1, 1.8, and 2.3 mm with a 3-mm threshold correction and to 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mm with an every-2-min correction in the left-right, superoinferior, and anteroposterior directions, respectively. The periodic corrections significantly increase the treatment time and increased the number of instances when the setup correction was made during transient excursions. CONCLUSIONS: The residual systematic and random error due to intrafraction prostate motion is small after on-line setup correction. Threshold-based and time-based intervention strategies both reduced the planning target volume margins. The time-based strategies increased the treatment time and the in-fraction position fluctuation",

abstract="PURPOSE: To develop a deliverable four-dimensional (4D) intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning method for dynamic multileaf collimator (MLC) tumor tracking delivery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The deliverable 4D IMRT planning method involves aligning MLC leaf motion parallel to the major axis of target motion and translating MLC leaf positions by the difference in the target centroid position between respiratory phases of the 4D CT scan. This method ignores nonlinear respiratory motion and deformation. A three-dimensional (3D) optimal method whereby an IMRT plan on each respiratory phase of the 4D CT scan was independently optimized was used for comparison. For 12 lung cancer patient 4D CT scans, individual phase plans and deformable dose-summed 4D plans using the two methods were created and compared. RESULTS: For each of the individual phase plans, the deliverable method yielded similar isodose distributions and dose-volume histograms. The deliverable and 3D optimal methods yielded statistically equivalent dose-volume metrics for both individual phase plans and 4D plans (p > 0.05 for all metrics compared). The deliverable method was affected by 4D CT artifacts in one case. Both methods were affected by high vector field variations from deformable registration. CONCLUSIONS: The deliverable method yielded similar dose distributions for each of the individual phase plans and statistically equivalent dosimetric values compared with the 3D optimal method, indicating that the deliverable method is dosimetrically robust to the variations of fractional time spent in respiratory phases on a given 4D CT scan. Nonlinear target motion and deformation did not cause significant dose discrepancies",

abstract="The purpose of this study is to develop a four-dimensional (4D) intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment-planning method by modifying and applying a dynamic multileaf collimator (DMLC) motion-tracking algorithm. The 4D radiotherapy treatment scenario investigated is to obtain a 4D treatment plan based on a 4D computed tomography (CT) planning scan and to have the delivery flexible enough to account for changes in tumor position during treatment delivery. For each of 4D CT planning scans from 12 lung cancer patients, a reference phase plan was created; with its MLC leaf positions and three-dimensional (3D) tumor motion, the DMLC motion-tracking algorithm generated MLC leaf sequences for the plans of other respiratory phases. Then, a deformable dose-summed 4D plan was created by merging the leaf sequences of individual phase plans. Individual phase plans, as well as the deformable dose-summed 4D plan, are similar for each patient, indicating that this method is dosimetrically robust to the variations of fractional time spent in respiratory phases on a given 4D CT planning scan. The 4D IMRT treatment-planning method utilizing the DMLC motion-tracking algorithm explicitly accounts for 3D tumor motion and thus hysteresis and nonlinear motion, and is deliverable on a linear accelerator",

abstract="The rationale for study of proton radiation therapy is that, for some anatomic sites and tumors, the treatment volume is smaller; i.e., there is less irradiation of nontarget tissue while the target is included in three dimensions at each treatment session. As a result, the dose to the target can be raised. The consequence is that the tumor control probability improves and the frequency and severity of treatment-related morbidity decrease. These results come about from the physical fact that the proton range in tissue is finite; in comparison, absorption of photons is an exponential function and, hence, some dose is received for the full-beam path through the body. Accordingly, the dose deep to the target for proton treatments can be zero for each beam path. This situation provides a virtually certain means of improving the treatment outcome for selected categories of patients. Experience to date with proton radiation therapy has been quite limited. As of June 1991, the total number of proton radiation-treated patients was 11,763 from the various centers. Of that number, approximately 46\% and 32\% have been treated for small benign intracranial lesions (principally pituitary adenomas and arteriovenous malformations) and for tumors of the eye, respectively. Thus, only some 2500 patients have been treated for all other tumor types. The results from three centers and approximately 2800 patients with uveal melanoma are that the local control rate was 96\% (for failures in-field, marginal, and in other parts of the eye). The local control results for chondrosarcomas and chordomas of the skull base are 91\% and 65\%, respectively. These percentages compare with some 35\% achieved with conventional treatment. Experience with arteriovenous malformations indicates that control of bleeding and disappearance of the lesion are comparable to those achieved by other procedures. The developments from the proton therapy programs have contributed greatly to radiation treatment planning, e.g., the first three-dimensional treatment planning system put into regular clinical use (uveal melanoma), beam's eye view, digital-reconstructed radiograph, dose-volume histograms, and definitions of the uncertainty in dose around any defined point. The potential for clinical gains is high. In May 1991, the Proton Radiation Oncology Group was formed to design, supervise, and coordinate clinical trials and to assist in data analysis. The efficacy of proton radiation therapy will be compared with that of photon therapy of the very highest technology",

abstract="Concern for risk of radiation-induced cancer is growing with the increasing number of cancer patients surviving long term. This study examined data on radiation transformation of mammalian cells in vitro and on the risk of an increased cancer incidence after irradiation of mice, dogs, monkeys, atomic bomb survivors, occupationally exposed persons, and patients treated with radiation. Transformation of cells lines in vitro increased linearly with dose from approximately 1 to approximately 4-5 Gy. At <0.1 Gy, transformation was not increased in all studies. Dose-response relationships for cancer incidence varied with mouse strain, gender and tissue/organ. Risk of cancer in Macaca mulatta was not raised at 0.25-2.8 Gy. From the atomic bomb survivor study, risk is accepted as increasing linearly to 2 Sv for establishing exposure standards. In irradiated patients, risk of cancer increased significantly from 1 to 45 Gy (a low to a high dose level) for stomach and pancreas, but not for bladder and rectum (1-60 Gy) or kidney (1-15 Gy). Risk for several organs/tissues increased substantially at doses far above 2 Gy. There is great heterogeneity in risk of radiation-associated cancer between species, strains of a species, and organs within a species. At present, the heterogeneity between and within patient populations of virtually every parameter considered in risk estimation results in substantial uncertainty in quantification of a general risk factor. An implication of this review is that reduced risks of secondary cancer should be achieved by any technique that achieved a dose reduction down to approximately [corrected] 0.1 Gy, i.e. dose to tissues distant from the target. The proportionate gain should be greatest for dose decrement to less than 2 Gy",

abstract="PURPOSE: In radiotherapy for prostate cancer, the rectum is the major dose-limiting structure. Physically separating the rectum from the prostate (e.g., by injecting a spacer) can reduce the rectal radiation dose. Despite pilot clinical studies, no careful analysis has been done of the risks, benefits, and dosimetric effects of this practice. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using cadaveric specimens, 20 mL of a hydrogel was injected between the prostate and rectum using a transperineal approach. Imaging was performed before and after spacer placement, and the cadavers were subsequently dissected. Ten intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans were generated (five before and five after separation), allowing for characterization of the rectal dose reduction. To quantify the amount of prostate-rectum separation needed for effective rectal dose reduction, simulations were performed using nine clinically generated intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans. RESULTS: In the cadaveric studies, an average of 12.5 mm of prostate-rectum separation was generated with the 20-mL hydrogel injections (the seminal vesicles were also separated from the rectum). The average rectal volume receiving 70 Gy decreased from 19.9\% to 4.5\% (p < .05). In the simulation studies, a prostate-rectum separation of 10 mm was sufficient to reduce the mean rectal volume receiving 70 Gy by 83.1\% (p <.05). No additional reduction in the average rectal volume receiving 70 Gy was noted after 15 mm of separation. In addition, spacer placement allowed for increased planning target volume margins without exceeding the rectal dose tolerance. CONCLUSION: Prostate-rectum spacers can allow for reduced rectal toxicity rates, treatment intensification, and/or reduced dependence on complex planning and treatment delivery techniques",

abstract="PURPOSE: To determine the effect of radiation dose escalation on biochemical and/or disease failure in patients with localized prostate cancer treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between May 1987 and December 2000, 1473 patients were assessed after treatment with 3D-CRT. The mean patient age was 70.4 +/- 6.8 years, 1316 patients had T1-T2 disease, and 1150 had Gleason score <or=7. The median pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 8.9 ng/mL. The mean dose was 71.7 +/- 4.3 Gy (range 60.0-80.4). Failure was defined as the first event of any of the following: biochemical failure, local recurrence or metastasis, postirradiation hormonal therapy, or death from disease. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 35.2 months, 395 failures (26.8\%) had occurred. Adjusting for dose as a continuous variable, the hazard ratio for failure was 2.03 (p < 0.0001) for 569 intermediate-risk patients (stage T1-T2 and Gleason score 7 or PSA 10-20 ng/mL) and 5.16 (p < 0.0001) for 456 high-risk patients (stage T3-T4 or PSA >20 ng/mL or Gleason score >or=8) compared with 448 low-risk patients (stage T1-T2 and Gleason score <or=6 and PSA <10 ng/mL). For intermediate-risk patients, each 1-Gy increment in total radiation dose was associated with a highly significant 8\% reduction in the probability of failure (hazard ratio = 0.92, p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Dose escalation using 3D-CRT significantly reduces the risk of biochemical/disease failure among intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients",

Gross tumor volume, clinical target volume (CTV) and organs at risk (OARs) were delineated. Field-specific target volumes (FTVs) were calculated, and 48Gy(RBE) in a single fraction was prescribed to the FTVs delivered from four beam angles. The dose assessment metrics were quantified by changing the number of PCR and the results for the ungated and gated scenarios were then compared.ResultsFor the ungated strategy, the mean dose delivered to 95\% of the volume of the CTV (CTV-D95) was in average 45.3???0.9?Gy(RBE) even with a single rescanning (1???PCR). Using 4???PCR or more achieved adequate target coverage (CTV-D95?=?46.6???0.3?Gy(RBE) for ungated 4???PCR) and excellent dose homogeneity (homogeneity index =1.0???0.2\% for ungated 4???PCR). Applying respiratory gating, percentage of lung receiving at least 20?Gy(RBE) (lung-V20) and heart maximal dose, averaged over all patients, significantly decreased by 12\% (p?<?0.05) and 13\% (p?<?0.05), respectively.ConclusionsFour or more PCR during PBS-CIRT improved dose conformation to moving lung tumors without gating.

abstract="PURPOSE: We performed a treatment planning study to demonstrate the potential dosimetric benefits of anterior-oriented fields for prostate irradiation by proton beam. A novel in vivo beam range control method shows millimeter accuracy, suggesting that such fields could be safely used to spare the rectum given the sharp distal penumbra of protons. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten prostate patients treated with water-filled endorectal balloon were selected. Bilateral fields were planned following the conventional treatment protocol. Three anterior-oriented fields (0, +30, -30 degrees ) were planned, with the range compensators manually adjusted to improve rectal sparing. Dose distributions to the clinical target volume, rectum, anterior rectal wall (ARW), bladder, bladder wall (BW), and femoral heads were compared for: A) equally weighted bilateral fields, B) a single straight anterior field, and C) two equally weighted anterior-oblique fields. RESULTS: The anterior-oriented fields required much less beam energy, approximately 10 cm water equivalent path length less than lateral fields. For ARW, the V(95\%) for Plans A, B, and C were 39\%, 8\%, and 6\%, respectively; the corresponding V(80\%) were 59\%, 27\%, and 26\%, respectively (p = 0.002 when Plan A was compared with B or C). Plan B irradiated a larger volume of BW than did Plan A by 3\% at V(95\%), 11\% at V(80\%), and 16\% at V(50\%) (p = 0.002), whereas Plan C differs little from Plan A for BW at these dose levels. The femoral heads received approximately 40\% of the prescription dose in Plan A, but negligible dose in Plans B and C. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to lateral fields, anterior-oriented fields can significantly reduce dose to the ARW, particularly at high dose levels. These fields alone, or in combination with lateral fields, allow for the possibility of either reducing treatment toxicity at current prescription doses or further dose escalation in the treatment of prostate cancer",

abstract="PURPOSE: To quantitatively evaluate the impact of interplay effect and plan robustness associated with intrafraction and residual interfraction prostate motion for pencil beam scanning proton therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten prostate cancer patients with weekly verification CTs underwent pencil beam scanning with the bilateral single-field uniform dose (SFUD) modality. A typical field had 10-15 energy layers and 500-1000 spots. According to their treatment logs, each layer delivery time was <1 s, with average time to change layers of approximately 8 s. Real-time intrafraction prostate motion was determined from our previously reported prospective study using Calypso beacon transponders. Prostate motion and beam delivering sequence of the worst-case scenario patient were synchronized to calculate the ``true'' dose received by the prostate. The intrafraction effect was examined by applying the worst-case scenario prostate motion on the planning CT, and the residual interfraction effect was examined on the basis of weekly CT scans. The resultant dose variation of target and critical structures was examined to evaluate the interplay effect. RESULTS: The clinical target volume (CTV) coverage was degraded because of both effects. The CTV D99 (percentage dose to 99\% of the CTV) varied up to 10\% relative to the initial plan in individual fractions. However, over the entire course of treatment the total dose degradation of D99 was 2\%-3\%, with a standard deviation of <2\%. Absolute differences between SFUD, intensity modulate proton therapy, and one-field-per-day SFUD plans were small. The intrafraction effect dominated over the residual interfraction effect for CTV coverage. Mean dose to the anterior rectal wall increased approximately 10\% because of combined residual interfraction and intrafraction effects, the interfraction effect being dominant. CONCLUSIONS: Both intrafraction and residual interfraction prostate motion degrade CTV coverage within a clinically acceptable level. One-field-per-day SFUD delivered twice is as robust as the bilateral SFUD plan treated daily over the course of treatment",

abstract="We present a new quantification technique for three-dimensional (3D) lung motion by means of tracking the anatomical features inside the lung using a set of sequential 3D-CT images (a 4D-CT image). The method is based on the conservation of topology, such as connections and junctions of vessels, during the motion. Lung CT images are used to do lung volume modeling, lung vessel extracting and thinning, and coordinates of vessel bifurcations are derived as feature points. Such feature points are tracked in a series of 3D-CT images, i.e., the points are individually tracked between two successive 3D-CT images, in which the lung is deformed. Consequently, 3D displacement vectors are obtained. The feature point tracking is carried out using point pattern matching with a probabilistic relaxation method. We examined this technique using a lung 3D-CT image and artificially deformed one, and separately scanned CT images for a rigid bifurcation phantom. The studies estimated that the error of the vectors is within approximately 1 voxel, i.e., 1 mm or less. Therefore, the accuracy is expected to be high enough for radiation therapy. This technique enables us to quantify realistic 3D organ motion without any fiducial markers. It can be applied to the quantification of tumor (target volume) deformation by gridding interpolation into all voxels. We expect it to be useful for dose estimation in mobile organs and for 4D treatment planning in radiation therapy",

abstract="PURPOSE: To report acute toxicity and to evaluate the relationship between dose-volume effects and acute toxicity in patients with localized prostate cancer, treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Acute toxicity (both lower gastrointestinal [GI] and genito-urinary [GU]) in 100 patients treated with IMRT definitively to a prescribed dose of 70 Gy were assessed using RTOG scoring criteria. A rectal balloon was used for prostate immobilization. Mean doses to seminal vesicles, prostate, bladder, and rectum were recorded. Average irradiated bladder and rectal volumes above 65, 70, and 75 Gy were assessed. A relationship between dose volume and clinical toxicity was evaluated. All patients completed the full duration of acute toxicity assessment. RESULTS: Mean doses to the prostate and seminal vesicles were 75.8 and 73.9 Gy. This represents a moderate dose escalation. Acute GI toxicity profile was very favorable. Eleven percent and 6\% of the patients had grade 1 and 2 GI toxicity, respectively, while 83\% had no GI complaint. For GU complaints, 38\% and 35\% had grade 1 and 2 toxicity, respectively, while 27\% had no complaints. There was no grade 3 or higher acute GI or GU toxicity. Mean doses to the bladder were 22.8, 23.4, and 26.1 Gy for grade 0, 1, and 2 GU toxicity, respectively (p = 0.132). There is no statistically significant relationship between acute GU toxicity and the bladder volume receiving > 65 Gy, > 70 Gy, or > 75 Gy. In evaluating acute GI toxicity, there are very few grade 1 and 2 events. No relationship was found between acute rectal toxicity and mean rectal dose or irradiated rectal volumes receiving more than 65, 70, and 75 Gy. CONCLUSION: The findings are important with regard to the safety of IMRT, especially in reducing acute GI toxicity. Dose escalation with IMRT using a prostate immobilization technique is feasible. The findings are also important because they contribute to the clinical and dosimetric correlation aspect in the use of IMRT to treat prostate cancer. A larger cohort may be needed to determine if there is a relationship between acute GU toxicity and (a) mean bladder dose and (b) irradiated bladder volume receiving > 65 Gy, > 70 Gy, or > 75 Gy. A larger cohort of patients treated to a higher dose may be needed to show a relationship between dose volume and acute GI toxicity",

abstract="High dose gradients are inherent to ion beam therapy. This results in high sensitivity to discrepancies between planned and delivered dose distributions. Therefore an accurate knowledge of the ion stopping power of the traversed tissue is critical. One proposed method to ensure high quality dose deposition is to measure the stopping power by ion radiography. Although the idea of imaging with highly energetic ions is more than forty years old, there is a lack of simple detectors suitable for this purpose. In this study the performance of an amorphous silicon flat-panel detector, originally designed for photon imaging, was investigated for quantitative carbon ion radiography and tomography. The flat-panel detector was exploited to measure the water equivalent thickness (WET) and water equivalent path length (WEPL) of a phantom at the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center (HIT). To do so, the ambiguous correlation of detector signal to particle energy was overcome by active or passive variation of carbon ion beam energy and measurement of the signal-to-beam energy correlation. The active method enables one to determine the WET of the imaged object with an uncertainty of 0.5 mm WET. For tomographic WEPL measurements the passive method was exploited resulting in an accuracy of 0.01 WEPL. The developed imaging technique presents a method to measure the two-dimensional maps of WET and WEPL of phantoms with a simple and commercially available detector. High spatial resolution of 0.8 x 0.8 mm(2) is given by the detector design. In the future this powerful tool will be used to evaluate the performance of the treatment planning algorithm by studying WET uncertainties",

abstract="Recently, a commercial system capable of x-ray image guided patient positioning and respiratory gated delivery has become available. Here we describe the operational principles of this system and investigate its geometric targeting accuracy under controlled conditions. The system tracks breathing via infrared (IR) detection of reflective markers located on the patient?s abdomen. Localization kilovoltage (kV) x-rays are triggered from within the gated delivery window portion of the breathing trace and after positioning, the tumour will cross the linac isocentre during gated delivery. We tested geometric accuracy of this system by localizing and delivering gated fields to a moving phantom. Effects of phantom speed, gating window location, timing errors and phantom rotations on positioning and gating accuracy were investigated. The system delivered gated fields to both a moving and static phantom with equal accuracy.

abstract="Target-tracking techniques can be categorized based on the mechanism of the feedback loop. In real time tracking, breathing-delivery phase correlation is provided to the treatment delivery hardware. Clinical implementation of target tracking in real time requires major hardware modifications. In breathing synchronized delivery (BSD), the patient is guided to breathe in accordance with target motion derived from four-dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT). Violations of mechanical limitations of hardware are to be avoided at the treatment planning stage. Hardware modifications are not required. In this article, using sliding window IMRT delivery as an example, we have described step-by-step the implementation of target tracking by the BSD technique: (1) A breathing guide is developed from patient's normal breathing pattern. The patient tries to reproduce this guiding cycle by following the display in the goggles; (2) 4D-CT scans are acquired at all the phases of the breathing cycle; (3) The average tumor trajectory is obtained by deformable image registration of 4D-CT datasets and is smoothed by Fourier filtering; (4) Conventional IMRT planning is performed using the images at reference phase (full exhalation phase) and a leaf sequence based on optimized fluence map is generated; (5) Assuming the patient breathes with a reproducible breathing pattern and the machine maintains a constant dose rate, the treatment process is correlated with the breathing phase; (6) The instantaneous average tumor displacement is overlaid on the dMLC position at corresponding phase; and (7) DMLC leaf speed and acceleration are evaluated to ensure treatment delivery. A custom-built mobile phantom driven by a computer-controlled stepper motor was used in the dosimetry verification. A stepper motor was programmed such that the phantom moved according to the linear component of tumor motion used in BSD treatment planning. A conventional plan was delivered on the phantom with and without motion. The BSD plan was also delivered on the phantom that moved with the prescheduled pattern and synchronized with the delivery of each beam. Film dosimetry showed underdose and overdose in the superior and inferior regions of the target, respectively, if the tumor motion is not compensated during the delivery. BSD delivery resulted in a dose distribution very similar to the planned treatments",

abstract="Modern radiotherapy techniques such as intensity modulation are capable of generating complex dose distributions whose high dose areas tightly conform to the tumour target volume, sparing critical organs even when they are located in close proximity. This potential can only be exploited to its full extent when the accumulated dose actually delivered over the complete treatment course is sufficiently close to the dose computed on the initial CT scan used for treatment planning. Exact patient repositioning is mandatory, but also other sources of error, e.g. changes of the patient's anatomy under therapy, should be taken into account. At the German Cancer Research Center, we use a combination of a linear accelerator and a CT scanner installed in one room and sharing the same couch. It allows the quantification and correction of interfractional variations between planning and treatment delivery. In this paper, we describe treatments of prostate, paraspinal and head and neck tumours. All patients were immobilized by customized fixation devices and treated in a stereotactic setup. For each patient, frequent CT scans were taken during the treatment course. Each scan was compared with the original planning CT using manual checks and automatic rigid matching algorithms. Depending on the individual case, the adaptation to variations was carried out offline after several fractions or in real-time between the CT scan and linac irradiation. We discuss the techniques for detecting and correcting interfractional errors and outline the procedural steps of a linac-CT scanner-supported radiation treatment course",

journal="Physics in Medicine and Biology",
year="2006",
volume="51",
number="6",
pages="117",
abstract="For intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) of deep-seated tumours, dosimetric variations of the original static dose profiles due to breathing motion can be primarily considered as blurring effects known from conventional radiotherapy. The purpose of this dosimetric study was to clarify whether these results are transferable to superficial targets and to quantify the additional effect of fractionation. A solid polystyrene phantom and an anthropomorphic phantom were used for film and ion chamber dose measurements. The phantoms were installed on an electric driven device and moved with a frequency of 6 or 12 cycles per minute and an amplitude of 4 mm or 10 mm. A split beam geometry of two adjacent asymmetric fields and an IMRT treatment plan with 12 fields for irradiation of the breast were investigated. For the split beam geometry the dose modifications due to unintended superposition of partial fields were reduced by fractionation and completely smoothed out after 20 fractions. IMRT applied to the moving phantom led to a more homogeneous dose distribution compared to the static phantom. The standard deviation of the target dose which is a measure of the dose homogeneity was 10.3 cGy for the static phantom and 7.7 cGy for a 10 mm amplitude. The absolute dose values, measured with ionization chambers, remained unaffected. Irradiation of superficial targets by IMRT in the step-and-shoot technique did not result in unexpected dose perturbations due to breathing motion. We conclude that regular breathing motion does not jeopardize IMRT of superficial target volumes",

abstract="BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was the clinical implementation of a kV cone beam CT (CBCT) for setup correction in radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For evaluation of the setup correction workflow, six tumor patients (lung cancer, sacral chordoma, head-and-neck and paraspinal tumor, and two prostate cancer patients) were selected. All patients were treated with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, five of them with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). For patient fixation, a scotch cast body frame or a vacuum pillow, each in combination with a scotch cast head mask, were used. The imaging equipment, consisting of an x-ray tube and a flat panel imager (FPI), was attached to a Siemens linear accelerator according to the in-line approach, i.e. with the imaging beam mounted opposite to the treatment beam sharing the same isocenter. For dose delivery, the treatment beam has to traverse the FPI which is mounted in the accessory tray below the multi-leaf collimator. For each patient, a predefined number of imaging projections over a range of at least 200 degrees were acquired. The fast reconstruction of the 3D-CBCT dataset was done with an implementation of the Feldkamp-David-Kress (FDK) algorithm. For the registration of the treatment planning CT with the acquired CBCT, an automatic mutual information matcher and manual matching was used. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Bony landmarks were easily detected and the table shifts for correction of setup deviations could be automatically calculated in all cases. The image quality was sufficient for a visual comparison of the desired target point with the isocenter visible on the CBCT. Soft tissue contrast was problematic for the prostate of an obese patient, but good in the lung tumor case. The detected maximum setup deviation was 3 mm for patients fixated with the body frame, and 6 mm for patients positioned in the vacuum pillow. Using an action level of 2 mm translational error, a target point correction was carried out in 4 cases. The additional workload of the described workflow compared to a normal treatment fraction led to an extra time of about 10-12 minutes, which can be further reduced by streamlining the different steps. CONCLUSION: The cone beam CT attached to a LINAC allows the acquisition of a CT scan of the patient in treatment position directly before treatment. Its image quality is sufficient for determining target point correction vectors. With the presented workflow, a target point correction within a clinically reasonable time frame is possible. This increases the treatment precision, and potentially the complex patient fixation techniques will become dispensable",

Having two images to match, the main idea is to consider the objects boundaries in one image as semi-permeable membranes and to let the other image, considered as a deformable grid model, diffuse through these interfaces, by the action of effectors situated within the membranes. We illustrate this concept by an analogy with Maxwell's demons. We show that this concept relates to more traditional ones, based on attraction, with an intermediate step being optical flow techniques. We use the concept of diffusing models to derive three different non-rigid matching algorithms, one using all the intensity levels in the static image, one using only contour points, and a last one operating on already segmented images. Finally, we present results with synthesized deformations and real medical images, with applications to heart motion tracking and three-dimensional inter-patients matching",

abstract="For protons and other charged particles, the effect of set-up errors on the position of isodoses is considerably less in the direction of the incident beam than it is laterally. Therefore, the margins required between the clinical target volume (CTV) and planning target volume (PTV) can be less in the direction of the incident beam than laterally. Margins have been calculated for a typical head plan and a typical prostate plan, for a single field, a parallel opposed and a four-field arrangement of protons, and compared with margins calculated for photons, assuming identical geometrical uncertainties for each modality. In the head plan, where internal motion was assumed negligible, the CTV-PTV margin reduced from approximately 10 mm to 3 mm in the axial direction for the single field and parallel opposed plans. For a prostate plan, where internal motion cannot be ignored, the corresponding reduction in margin was from 11 mm to 7 mm. The planning organ at risk (PRV) margin in the axial direction reduced from 6 mm to 2 mm for the head plan, and from 7 mm to 4 mm for the prostate plan. No reduction was seen on the other axes, or for any axis of the four-field plans. Owing to the shape of proton dose distributions, there are many clinical cases in which good dose distributions can be obtained with one or two fields. When this is done, it is possible to use smaller PTV and PRV margins. This has the potential to convert untreatable cases, in which the PTV and PRV overlap, into cases with a gap between PTV and PRV of adequate size for treatment planning",

abstract="The purpose of this study was to evaluate the quality and accuracy of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) gated by active breathing control (ABC), which may be useful for image guidance in the presence of respiration. Comparisons were made between conventional ABC-CBCT (stop and go), fast ABC-CBCT (a method to speed up the acquisition by slowing the gantry instead of stopping during free breathing), and free breathing respiration correlated CBCT. Image quality was assessed in phantom. Accuracy of reconstructed voxel intensity, uniformity, and root mean square error were evaluated. Registration accuracy (bony and soft tissue) was quantified with both an anthropomorphic and a quality assurance phantom. Gantry angle accuracy was measured with respect to gantry speed modulation. Conventional ABC-CBCT scan time ranged from 2.3 to 5.8 min. Fast ABC-CBCT scan time ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 min, and respiratory correlated CBCT scans took 2.1 min to complete. Voxel intensity value for ABC gated scans was accurate relative to a normal clinical scan with all projections. Uniformity and root mean square error performance degraded as the number of projections used in the reconstruction of the fast ABC-CBCT scans decreased (shortest breath hold, longest free breathing segment). Registration accuracy for small, large, and rotational corrections was within 1 mm and 1 degrees. Gantry angle accuracy was within 1 degrees for all scans. For high-contrast targets, performance for image-guidance purposes was similar for fast and conventional ABC-CBCT scans and respiration correlated CBCT",

abstract="This study compares three online image guidance techniques (IGRT) for prostate IMRT treatment: bony-anatomy matching, soft-tissue matching, and online replanning. Six prostate IMRT patients were studied. Five daily CBCT scans from the first week were acquired for each patient to provide representative ``snapshots'' of anatomical variations during the course of treatment. Initial IMRT plans were designed for each patient with seven coplanar 15 MV beams on a Eclipse treatment planning system. Two plans were created, one with a PTV margin of 10 mm and another with a 5 mm PTV margin. Based on these plans, the delivered dose distributions to each CBCT anatomy was evaluated to compare bony-anatomy matching, soft-tissue matching, and online replanning. Matching based on bony anatomy was evaluated using the 10 mm PTV margin (``bone10''). Soft-tissue matching was evaluated using both the 10 mm (``soft10'') and 5 mm (``soft5'') PTV margins. Online reoptimization was evaluated using the 5 mm PTV margin (``adapt''). The replanning process utilized the original dose distribution as the basis and linear goal programming techniques for reoptimization. The reoptimized plans were finished in less than 2 min for all cases. Using each IGRT technique, the delivered dose distribution was evaluated on all 30 CBCT scans (6 patients x 5 CBCT/patient). The mean minimum dose (in percentage of prescription dose) to the CTV over five treatment fractions were in the ranges of 99\%-100\% (SD = 0.1\%-0.8\%), 65\%-98\% (SD = 0.4\%-19.5\%), 87\%-99\% (SD = 0.7\%-23.3\%), and 95\%-99\% (SD = 0.4\%-10.4\%) for the adapt, bone10, soft5, and soft10 techniques, respectively. Compared to patient position correction techniques, the online reoptimization technique also showed improvement in OAR sparing when organ motion/deformations were large. For bladder, the adapt technique had the best (minimum) D90, D50, and D30 values for 24, 17, and 15 fractions out of 30 total fractions, while it also had the best D90, D50, and D30 values for the rectum for 25, 16, and 19 fractions, respectively. For cases where the adapt plans did not score the best for OAR sparing, the gains of the OAR sparing in the repositioning-based plans were accompanied by an underdosage in the target volume. To further evaluate the fast online replanning technique, a gold-standard plan (``new'' plan) was generated for each CBCT anatomy on the Eclipse treatment planning system. The OAR sparing from the online replanning technique was compared to the new plan. The differences in D90, D50, and D30 of the OARs between the adapt and the new plans were less than 5\% in 3 patients and were between 5\% and 10\% for the remaining three. In summary, all IGRT techniques could be sufficient to correct simple geometrical variations. However, when a high degree of deformation or differential organ position displacement occurs, the online reoptimization technique is feasible with less than 2 min optimization time and provides improvements in both CTV coverage and OAR sparing over the position correction techniques. For these cases, the reoptimization technique can be a highly valuable online IGRT tool to correct daily treatment uncertainties, especially when hypofractionation scheme is applied and daily correction, rather than averaging over many fractions, is required to match the original plan",

abstract="Respiratory motion artifacts in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can alter lesion intensity profiles, and result in substantially reduced activity and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs). We propose a corrective algorithm, coined ``retrospective stacking'' (RS), to restore image quality without requiring additional scan time. Retrospective stacking uses b-spline deformable image registration to combine amplitude-binned PET data along the entire respiratory cycle into a single respiratory end point. We applied the method to a phantom model consisting of a small, hot vial oscillating within a warm background, as well as to 18FDG-PET images of a pancreatic and a liver patient. Comparisons were made using cross-section visualizations, activity profiles, and CNRs within the region of interest. Retrospective stacking was found to properly restore the lesion location and intensity profile in all cases. In addition, RS provided CNR improvements up to three-fold over gated images, and up to five-fold over ungated data. These phantom and patient studies demonstrate that RS can correct for lesion motion and deformation, while substantially improving tumor visibility and background noise",

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS:Phase 2 North American multicenter study of patients aged 18 years or older with biopsy-proven peripheral T1-T2N0M0 non-small cell tumors (measuring <5 cm in diameter) and medical conditions precluding surgical treatment. The prescription dose was 18 Gy per fraction x 3 fractions (54 Gy total) with entire treatment lasting between 1(1/2) and 2 weeks. The study opened May 26, 2004, and closed October 13, 2006; data were analyzed through August 31, 2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:The primary end point was 2-year actuarial primary tumor control; secondary end points were disease-free survival (ie, primary tumor, involved lobe, regional, and disseminated recurrence), treatment-related toxicity, and overall survival. RESULTS:A total of 59 patients accrued, of which 55 were evaluable (44 patients with T1 tumors and 11 patients with T2 tumors) with a median follow-up of 34.4 months (range, 4.8-49.9 months). Only 1 patient had a primary tumor failure; the estimated 3-year primary tumor control rate was 97.6\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 84.3\%-99.7\%). Three patients had recurrence within the involved lobe; the 3-year primary tumor and involved lobe (local) control rate was 90.6\% (95\% CI, 76.0\%-96.5\%). Two patients experienced regional failure; the local-regional control rate was 87.2\% (95\% CI, 71.0\%-94.7\%). Eleven patients experienced disseminated recurrence; the 3-year rate of disseminated failure was 22.1\% (95\% CI, 12.3\%-37.8\%). The rates for disease-free survival and overall survival at 3 years were 48.3\% (95\% CI, 34.4\%-60.8\%) and 55.8\% (95\% CI, 41.6\%-67.9\%), respectively. The median overall survival was 48.1 months (95\% CI, 29.6 months to not reached). Protocol-specified treatment-related grade 3 adverse events were reported in 7 patients (12.7\%; 95\% CI, 9.6\%-15.8\%); grade 4 adverse events were reported in 2 patients (3.6\%; 95\% CI, 2.7\%-4.5\%). No grade 5 adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION:Patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer who received stereotactic body radiation therapy had a survival rate of 55.8\% at 3 years, high rates of local tumor control, and moderate treatment-related morbidity.",

abstract="Introduction: Surgical resection is standard therapy for patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), however, many patients are medically inoperable. We set out to investigate a new therapy akin to brain radiosurgery called extracranial stereotactic radioablation (ESR) in a phase I trial. Patients and methods: Eligible patients included those with clinically staged T1 or T2 (tumor size, [<=] 7 cm) N0M0 biopsy confirmed NSCLC. All patients had comorbid medical problems that precluded thoracotomy. The median age was 75 years, and the median Karnofsky performance status was 80. ESR was administered in three separate fractions over 2 weeks. Three to five patients were treated within each dose cohort starting at 800 cGy per fraction (total, 2,400 cGy) followed by successive dose escalations of 200 cGy per fraction (total increase per cohort, 600 cGy). Waiting periods occurred between dose cohorts to observe toxicity. Patients with T1 vs T2 tumors underwent separate independent dose escalations. Results: A total of 37 patients were enrolled since February 2000. One patient experienced grade 3 pneumonitis, and another patient had grade 3 hypoxia. For the entire population, there was no appreciable decline in cardiopulmonary function as measured by symptoms, physical examination, need for oxygen supplementation, pulmonary function testing, arterial blood gas determinations, or regular chest imaging. Both T-stage groups ultimately reached and tolerated 2,000 cGy per fraction for three fractions (total, 6,000 cGy). The maximum tolerated dose for this therapy in either T-stage group has yet to be reached. Tumors responded to treatment in 87\% of patients (complete response, 27\%). After a median follow-up period of 15.2 months, six patients experienced local failure, all of whom had received doses of < 1,800 cGy per fraction. Conclusions: Very high radiation dose treatments were tolerated in this population of medically inoperable patients with stage I NSCLC using ESR techniques",

abstract="PURPOSE: Surgical resection is standard therapy in stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, many patients are inoperable due to comorbid diseases. Building on a previously reported phase I trial, we carried out a prospective phase II trial using stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in this population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients included clinically staged T1 or T2 ([\&le;] 7 cm), N0, M0, biopsy-confirmed NSCLC. All patients had comorbid medical problems that precluded lobectomy. SBRT treatment dose was 60 to 66 Gy total in three fractions during 1 to 2 weeks. RESULTS: All 70 patients enrolled completed therapy as planned and median follow-up was 17.5 months. The 3-month major response rate was 60\%. Kaplan-Meier local control at 2 years was 95\%. Altogether, 28 patients have died as a result of cancer (n = 5), treatment (n = 6), or comorbid illnesses (n = 17). Median overall survival was 32.6 months and 2-year overall survival was 54.7\%. Grade 3 to 5 toxicity occurred in a total of 14 patients. Among patients experiencing toxicity, the median time to observation was 10.5 months. Patients treated for tumors in the peripheral lung had 2-year freedom from severe toxicity of 83\% compared with only 54\% for patients with central tumors. CONCLUSION: High rates of local control are achieved with this SBRT regimen in medically inoperable patients with stage I NSCLC. Both local recurrence and toxicity occur late after this treatment. This regimen should not be used for patients with tumors near the central airways due to excessive toxicity",

abstract="PURPOSE: Radiotherapy plays a major role in the treatment strategy of childhood sarcomas. Consequences of treatment are likely to affect the survivor's quality of life significantly. We investigated the feasibility of spot-scanning proton therapy (PT) for soft tissue tumors in childhood. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixteen children with soft tissue sarcomas were included. Median age at PT was 3.3 years. In 10 children the tumor histology was embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. All tumors were located in the head or neck, parameningeal, or paraspinal, or pelvic region. In the majority of children, the tumor was initially unresectable (Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study [IRS] Group III in 75\%). In 50\% of children the tumors exceeded 5 cm. Fourteen children had chemotherapy before and during PT. Median total dose of radiotherapy was 50 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE). All 16 children were treated with spot-scanning proton therapy at the Paul Scherrer Institute, and in 3 children the PT was intensity-modulated (IMPT). RESULTS: After median follow-up of 1.5 years, local control was achieved in 12 children. Four children failed locally, 1 at the border of the radiation field and 3 within the field. All 4 children died of tumor recurrence. All 4 showed unfavorable characteristic either of site or histopathology of the tumor. Acute toxicity was low, with Grade 3 or 4 side effects according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) criteria occurring in the bone marrow only. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy was feasible and well tolerated. Early local control rates are comparable to those being achieved after conventional radiotherapy. For investigations on late effect, longer follow-up is needed",

abstract="Quantitative studies at the BEVALAC have demonstrated some of the physical and radiobiological factors that promise to make accelerated heavy ions important for the therapy of cancer. The measured physical dose-biological effect relationships allow the safe and effective delivery of therapeutic schedules of heavy ions. Among the charged particle beams available, carbon, neon and helium ions in the ``extended Bragg peak mode'' have optimal physical and biological effectiveness for delivery of therapy to deep seated tumors. The depth-dose profiles of these beams protect intervening and adjacent tissues as well as tissues beyond the range of the particles. For the treatment of hypoxic tumors, silicon and argon beams are being considered because they significantly depress the radiobiological oxygen effect in the region of the extended Bragg ionization peak. The depth-effectiveness of the argon beam is somewhat limited, however, because of primary particle fragmentation. Silicon beams have a depth-dose profile which is intermediate between that of neon and argon, and are candidates to become the particle of choice for maximizing high LET particle effects. Heavy accelerated ions depress enzymatic repair mechanisms, decrease variations of radiosensitivity during the cell division cycle, cause greater than expected delays in cell division, and decrease the protective effects of neighboring cells in organized systems. Near the Bragg peak, enhancement of heavy particle effects are observed in split dose schedules. Late and carcinogenic effects are being studied. With the newly developed Repair-Misrepair theory we can quantitatively model most observations"

abstract="BACKGROUND: The outcome of catheter ablation procedures of cardiac arrhythmias depends on the ability to evaluate the underlying mechanism and to depict target sites for ablation. Fusion of different imaging modalities within one system may improve electroanatomic modeling and facilitate ablation procedures. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to study the feasibility of fusion of multislice computed tomography (MSCT) with electroanatomic mapping to guide radiofrequency catheter ablation of atrial arrhythmias. METHODS: Sixteen patients (15 men, age 54 +/- 7 years) with drug-refractory atrial fibrillation (AF) underwent 64-slice MSCT within 2 days before radiofrequency catheter ablation. MSCT data were imported to the Carto electroanatomic mapping system. Using the new CartoMerge Image Integration Module, the MSCT images and the electroanatomic map were aligned. A statistical algorithm provided information about the accuracy of the fusion process. RESULTS: In all patients, MSCT images could be fused with the electroanatomic map. Mean distance between the mapping points and the MSCT surface ranged from 1.7 +/- 1.2 mm to 2.8 +/- 1.8 mm. This resulted in an average of 2.1 +/- 0.2 mm for the patient group as a whole. CONCLUSION: MSCT images can be fused with the three-dimensional electroanatomic mapping system in an accurate manner. Anatomy-based catheter ablation procedures for atrial arrhythmias may be facilitated by integration of different imaging modalities",

abstract="Clinical trials of carbon radiotherapy started at HIMAC in 1994 using three treatment rooms and four beam ports, two horizontal and two vertical. The broad beam method was adopted to make a three-dimensionally uniform field at an isocenter. A spot beam extracted from an accelerator was laterally spread out by using a pair of wobbler magnets and a scatterer. A bar ridge filter modulated the beam energy to obtain the spread out Bragg peak (SOBP). The SOBP was designed to be flat in terms of the biological dose based on the consideration that the field consisted of various beams with different LET. Finally, the field of 20 cm in diameter with +/- 2.5\% uniformity was formed at the isocenter. The width of the maximum SOBP was 15 cm. When treating the lung or liver, organs that move due to breathing, the beam was irradiated only during the expiration period in a respiration-gated irradiation method. This reduced the treatment margin of the moving target. In order to prevent normal tissues adjacent to the target volume from irradiation by an unwanted dose, a layer-stacking method was developed. In this method, thin SOBP layers which have different ranges were piled up step by step from the distal end to the entrance of the target volume. At the same time, a multi-leaf collimator was used to change the aperture shape to match the shape of each layer to the cross-sectional shape of the target. This method has been applied to rather large volume cancers including bone and soft-tissue cancers. Only a few serious problems in the irradiation systems have been encountered since the beginning of the clinical trials. Overall the systems have been working stably and reliably",

abstract="The use of external surrogates to predict tumor motion in real-time for extra-cranial sites requires the use of accurate correlation models. This is extremely challenging when motion prediction is to be performed over several breathing cycles, as occurs for real-time tumor tracking with Cyberknife((R)) Synchrony((R)). In this work we compare three different approaches to infer tumor motion based on external surrogates, since no comparative study is available to assess the accuracy of correlation models in tumor tracking over a long time period. We selected 20 cases in a database of 130 patients treated with real-time tumor tracking by means of the Synchrony((R)) module. The implemented correlation models comprise linear/quadratic correlation, artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic. The accuracy of each correlation model is evaluated on the basis of ground truth tumor position information acquired during treatment, as detected by means of stereoscopic X-ray imaging. Results show that the implemented models achieve an error reduction with respect to Synchrony((R)), measured at the 95\% confidence level, up to 10.8\% for the fuzzy logic approach. This latter is able to partly reduce the incidence of tumor tracking errors above 6 mm, resulting in improved accuracy for larger discrepancies. In conclusion, complex models are suggested to predict tumor motion over long time periods. This leads to an effective improvement with respect to Cyberknife((R)) Synchrony((R)). Future studies will investigate the sensitivity of the implemented models to the input database, in order to define optimal strategies",

abstract="With the recent availability of 4D-CT, the accuracy of information on internal organ motion during respiration has improved significantly. We investigate the utility of organ motion information in IMRT treatment planning, using an in-house prototype optimization system. Four approaches are compared: (1) planning with optimized margins, based on motion information; (2) the \&lsquo;motion kernel\&rsquo; approach, in which a more accurate description of the dose deposit from a pencil beam to a moving target is achieved either through time-weighted averaging of influence matrices, calculated for different instances of anatomy (subsets of 4D-CT data, corresponding to various phases of motion) or through convolution of the pencil beam kernel with the probability density function describing the target motion; (3) optimal gating, or tracking with beam intensity maps optimized independently for each instance of anatomy; and (4) optimal tracking with beam intensity maps optimized simultaneously for all instances of anatomy. The optimization is based on a gradient technique and can handle both physical (dose\&ndash;volume) and equivalent uniform dose constraints. Optimization requires voxel mapping from phase to phase in order to score the dose in individual voxels as they move. The results show that, compared to the other approaches, margin expansion has a significant disadvantage by substantially increasing the integral dose to patient. While gating or tracking result in the best dose conformation to the target, the former elongates treatment time, and the latter significantly complicates the delivery procedure. The \&lsquo;motion kernel\&rsquo; approach does not provide a dosimetric advantage, compared to optimal tracking or gating, but might lead to more efficient delivery. A combination of gating with the \&lsquo;motion kernel\&rsquo; or margin expansion approach will increase the duty cycle and may provide one with the most efficient solution, in terms of complexity of the delivery procedure and dose conformality to the target",

abstract="Internal organ motion during the course of radiation therapy of cancer affects the distribution of the delivered dose and, generally, reduces its conformality to the targeted volume. Previously proposed approaches aimed at mitigating the effect of internal motion in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) included expansion of the target margins, motion-correlated delivery (e.g., respiratory gating, tumor tracking), and adaptive treatment plan optimization employing a probabilistic description of motion. We describe and test the tumor trailing strategy, which utilizes the synergy of motion-adaptive treatment planning and delivery methods. We regard the (rigid) target motion as a superposition of a relatively fast cyclic component (e.g., respiratory) and slow aperiodic trends (e.g., the drift of exhalation baseline). In the trailing approach, these two components of motion are decoupled and dealt with separately. Real-time motion monitoring is employed to identify the ``slow'' shifts, which are then corrected by applying setup adjustments. The delivery does not track the target position exactly, but trails the systematic trend due to the delay between the time a shift occurs, is reliably detected, and, subsequently, corrected. The ``fast'' cyclic motion is accounted for with a robust motion-adaptive treatment planning, which allows for variability in motion parameters (e.g., mean and extrema of the tidal volume, variable period of respiration, and expiratory duration). Motion-surrogate data from gated IMRT treatments were used to provide probability distribution data for motion-adaptive planning and to test algorithms that identified systematic trends in the character of motion. Sample IMRT fields were delivered on a clinical linear accelerator to a programmable moving phantom. Dose measurements were performed with a commercial two-dimensional ion-chamber array. The results indicate that by reducing intrafractional motion variability, the trailing strategy enhances relevance and applicability of motion-adaptive planning methods, and improves conformality of the delivered dose to the target in the presence of irregular motion. Trailing strategy can be applied to respiratory-gated treatments, in which the correction for the slow motion can increase the duty cycle, while robust probabilistic planning can improve management of the residual motion within the gate window. Similarly, trailing may improve the dose conformality in treatment of patients who exhibit detectable target motion of low amplitude, which is considered insufficient to provide a clinical indication for the use of respiratory-gated treatment (e.g., peak-to-peak motion of less than 10 mm). The mechanical limitations of implementing tumor trailing are less rigorous than those of real-time tracking, and the same technology could be used for both",

abstract="PURPOSE: To quantify daily variations in the anatomy of patients undergoing radiation therapy for prostate carcinoma, to estimate their effect on dose distribution, and to evaluate the effectiveness of current standard planning and setup approaches employed in proton therapy. METHODS: We used series of computed tomography data, which included the pretreatment scan, and between 21 and 43 in-room scans acquired on different treatment days, from 10 patients treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy at Morristown Memorial Hospital. Variations in femur rotation angles, thickness of subcutaneous adipose tissue, and physical depth to the distal surface of the prostate for lateral beam arrangement were recorded. Proton dose distributions were planned with the standard approach. Daily variations in the location of the prescription isodose were evaluated. RESULTS: In all 10 datasets, substantial variation was observed in the lateral tissue thickness (standard deviation of 1.7-3.6 mm for individual patients, variations of >5 mm from the planning computed tomography observed in all series), and femur rotation angle (standard deviation between 1.3 degrees and 4.8 degrees , with the maximum excursion exceeding 10 degrees in 6 of 10 datasets). Shifts in the position of treated volume (98\% isodose) were correlated with the variations in the lateral tissue thickness. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis suggests that, combined with image-guided setup verification, the range compensator expansion technique prevents loss of dose to target from femur rotation and soft-tissue deformation, in the majority of cases. Anatomic changes coupled with the uncertainties of particle penetration in tissue restrict possibilities for margin reduction in proton therapy of prostate cancer",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown a relationship between alterations in tissue oxygen metabolism and cellular changes following ischemia and reperfusion, such as energy store depletion and intracellular acidosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between tissue energy metabolism and intramuscular tissue oxygen tension in the mobilized latissimus dorsi muscle. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The latissimus dorsi muscle was raised in New Zealand white rabbits (n = 10, 2.5 +/- 0.5 kg). During 4 h of ischemia and 2 h of reperfusion, the intramuscular tissue oxygen tension (Licox PO2-microcatheter probe) and the status of phosphorylated muscle energy metabolites were measured using a high-field 31P-NMR spectrometer. Linear correlation was performed between 31P-NMR data and tissue oxygen tension readings. RESULTS: The tissue oxygen tension (PO2) values correlated significantly with phosphocreatine (PCr) (r = 0.96, P < 0.001), beta-adenosin triphosphate (beta-ATP) (r = 0.64, P <0.01), and intracellular pH (r = 0.82, P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these findings, we conclude that the data provided by tissue oxygen tension measurement offer a real time minimally invasive estimate of muscle oxidative metabolism during ischemia and reperfusion",

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Analysis was performed for 201 patients treated with the dose fractionation regimen established during three clinical trials performed between June 1995 and February 2004. Outcomes were measured in terms of toxicity, survival, freedom from local recurrence, and bNED. RESULTS: No Grade 3 or higher toxicities were observed in either the rectum or genitourinary system, and the incidences of Grade 2 rectum or genitourinary morbidity were only 1.0\% and 6.0\%, respectively. The overall 5-year biochemical relapse-free survival was 83.2\% without any local recurrence. Gleason score, initial PSA, and T stage were all significant prognostic factors for bNED, which was 97.1\% in patients with Gleason score < or =7 and initial PSA <20 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: Hypofractionated carbon ion radiotherapy with the established dose fractionation regimen yielded satisfactory bNED without local recurrence and with minimal morbidity. Long-term results are necessary to confirm the utility of carbon ion radiotherapy in the treatment of localized prostate cancer",

abstract="Abstract: ackground and purpose:Carbon ion beams provide physical and biological advantages over photons. This study summarizes the experiences of carbon ion radiotherapy at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) at the National Institute of Radiological SciencesMaterials and Methods:Between June 1994 and August 2003, a total of 1,601 patients with various types of malignant tumors were enrolled in phase I/II dose-escalation studies and clinical phase II studies. All but malignant glioma patients received carbon ion radiotherapy alone with a fraction number and overall treatment time being fixed for each tumor site, given to one field per day and 3 or 4 days per week. In dose-escalation studies, the total dose was escalated by 5 or 10\% increments to ensure a safe patient treatment and to determine appropriate dose levels.Results:In the initial dose-escalation studies, severe late complications of the recto-sigmoid colon and esophagus were observed in those patients who received high dose levels for prostate, uterine cervix and esophageal cancer. Such adverse effects, however, did shortly disappear as a result of determining safe dose levels and because of improvements in the irradiation method. Carbon ion radiotherapy has shown improvement of outcome for tumor entities: a) locally advanced head and neck tumors, in particular those with non-squamous cell histology including adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and malignant melanoma; b) early stage NSCLC and locally advanced NSCLC; c) locally advanced bone and soft tissue sarcomas not suited for surgical resection; d) locally advanced hepatocellular carcinomas; e) locally advanced prostate carcinomas, in particular for high-risk patients; f) chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base and cervical spine, and g) post-operative pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer. Treatment of malignant gliomas, pancreatic, uterine cervix, and esophageal cancer is being investigated within dose-escalation studies. There is a rationale for the use of short-course RT regimen due to the superior dose localization and the unique biological properties of high-LET beams. This has been proven in treatment of NSCLC and hepatoma, where the fraction number has been successfully reduced to 4 12 fractions delivered within 1 3 weeks. Even for other types of tumors including prostate cancer, bone/soft tissue sarcoma and head/neck tumors, it was equally possible to apply the therapy in much shorter treatment times as compared to conventional RT regimen. Conclusion: Carbon ion radiotherapy, due to its physical and biologic advantages over photons, has provided improved outcome in terms of minimized toxicity and high local control rates for locally advanced tumors and pathologically non-squamous cell type of tumors. Using carbon ion radiotherapy, hypofractionated radiotherapy with application of larger doses per fraction and a reduction of overall treatment times as compared to conventional radiotherapy was enabled",

abstract="In 1994 a Phase I/II clinical study on carbon ion radiotherapy was begun at NIRS using HIMAC, which was then the world's only heavy ion accelerator complex dedicated to medical use in a hospital environment. Among several types of ion species, we have chosen carbon ions for cancer therapy because they had the most optimal properties in terms of possessing, both physically and biologically, the most effective dose-localization in the body. The purpose of the clinical study was to investigate the efficacy of carbon ion radiotherapy against a variety of tumors as well as to develop effective techniques for delivering an efficient dose to the tumor. The RBE of carbon ions was estimated to be 2.0 to 3.0 along the SOBP for acute skin reactions. As of August 2006, a total of 2,867 patients had been entered into Phase I/II or Phase II studies and analyzed for toxicity and local tumor response. The results have shown that carbon ion radiotherapy has the potential ability to provide a sufficient dose to the tumor with acceptable morbidity in the surrounding normal tissues. Tumors that appear to respond favorably to carbon ions include locally advanced tumors and those with histologically non-squamous cell type of tumors such as adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, malignant melanoma, hepatoma, and bone/soft tissue sarcoma. By taking advantage of the biological and physical properties of high-LET radiation, the efficacy of treatment regimens with small fractions in short treatment times has been confirmed for almost all types of tumors in carbon ion radiotherapy",

abstract="Among various types of ion species, carbon ions are considered to have the most balanced, optimal properties in terms of possessing physically and biologically effective dose localization in the body. This is due to the fact that when compared with photon beams, carbon ion beams offer improved dose distribution, leading to the concentration of the sufficient dose within a target volume while minimizing the dose in the surrounding normal tissues. In addition, carbon ions, being heavier than protons, provide a higher biological effectiveness, which increases with depth, reaching the maximum at the end of the beam's range. This is practically an ideal property from the standpoint of cancer radiotherapy. Clinical studies have been carried out in the world to confirm the efficacy of carbon ions against a variety of tumors as well as to develop effective techniques for delivering an efficient dose to the tumor. Through clinical experiences of carbon ion radiotherapy at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences and Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung, a significant reduction in the overall treatment time with acceptable toxicities has been obtained in almost all types of tumors. This means that carbon ion radiotherapy has meanwhile achieved for itself a solid place in general practice. This review describes clinical results of carbon ion radiotherapy together with physical, biological and technological aspects of carbon ions",

abstract="PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation between the respiratory waveform measured using a respiratory sensor and three-dimensional (3D) tumor motion. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A laser displacement sensor (LDS: KEYENCE LB-300) that measures distance using infrared light was used as the respiratory sensor. This was placed such that the focus was in an area around the patient's navel. When the distance from the LDS to the body surface changes as the patient breathes, the displacement is detected as a respiratory waveform. To obtain the 3D tumor motion, a biplane digital radiography unit was used. For the tumor in the lung, liver, and esophagus of 26 patients, the waveform was compared with the 3D tumor motion. The relationship between the respiratory waveform and the 3D tumor motion was analyzed by means of the Fourier transform and a cross-correlation function. RESULTS: The respiratory waveform cycle agreed with that of the cranial-caudal and dorsal-ventral tumor motion. A phase shift observed between the respiratory waveform and the 3D tumor motion was principally in the range 0.0 to 0.3 s, regardless of the organ being measured, which means that the respiratory waveform does not always express the 3D tumor motion with fidelity. For this reason, the standard deviation of the tumor position in the expiration phase, as indicated by the respiratory waveform, was derived, which should be helpful in suggesting the internal margin required in the case of respiratory gated radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Although obtained from only a few breathing cycles for each patient, the correlation between the respiratory waveform and the 3D tumor motion was evident in this study. If this relationship is analyzed carefully and an internal margin is applied, the accuracy and convenience of respiratory gated radiotherapy could be improved by use of the respiratory sensor.Thus, it is expected that this procedure will come into wider use",

abstract="Significant differences exist in respiratory-gated proton beam delivery with a synchrotron-based accelerator system when compared to photon therapy with a conventional linear accelerator. Delivery of protons with a synchrotron accelerator is governed by a magnet excitation cycle pattern. Optimal synchronization of the magnet excitation cycle pattern with the respiratory motion pattern is critical to the efficiency of respiratory-gated proton delivery. There has been little systematic analysis to optimize the accelerator's operational parameters to improve gated treatment efficiency. The goal of this study was to estimate the overall efficiency of respiratory-gated synchrotron-based proton irradiation through realistic simulation. Using 62 respiratory motion traces from 38 patients, we simulated respiratory gating for duty cycles of 30\%, 20\% and 10\% around peak exhalation for various fixed and variable magnet excitation patterns. In each case, the time required to deliver 100 monitor units in both non-gated and gated irradiation scenarios was determined. Based on results from this study, the minimum time required to deliver 100 MU was 1.1 min for non-gated irradiation. For respiratory-gated delivery at a 30\% duty cycle around peak exhalation, corresponding average delivery times were typically three times longer with a fixed magnet excitation cycle pattern. However, when a variable excitation cycle was allowed in synchrony with the patient's respiratory cycle, the treatment time only doubled. Thus, respiratory-gated delivery of synchrotron-based pulsed proton irradiation is feasible and more efficient when a variable magnet excitation cycle pattern is used",

abstract="A synchrotron-based proton therapy system operates in a low repetition rate pulsed beam delivery mode. Unlike cyclotron-based beam delivery, there is no guarantee that a synchrotron beam can be delivered effectively or precisely under the respiratory-gated mode. To evaluate the performance of gated synchrotron treatment, we simulated proton beam delivery in the synchrotron-based respiratory-gated mode using realistic patient breathing signals. Parameters used in the simulation were respiratory motion traces (70 traces from 24 patients), respiratory gate levels (10\%, 20\% and 30\% duty cycles at the exhalation phase) and synchrotron magnet excitation cycles (T(cyc)) (fixed T(cyc) mode: 2.7, 3.0-6.0 s and each patient breathing cycle, and variable T(cyc) mode). The simulations were computed according to the breathing trace in which the proton beams were delivered. In the shorter fixed T(cyc) (<4 s), most of the proton beams were delivered uniformly to the target during the entire expiration phase of the respiratory cycle. In the longer fixed T(cyc) (>4 s) and the variable T(cyc) mode, the proton beams were not consistently delivered during the end-expiration phase of the respiratory cycle. However we found that the longer and variable T(cyc) operation modes delivered proton beams more precisely during irregular breathing",

abstract="Computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in oncological imaging as the modality of screening for malignancies, mapping out the treatment strategy at staging, assessing response to the treatment, and following up patient outcome after the treatment. The advent of multidetector-row CT (MDCT) has brought about dramatic changes in clinical oncological imaging. The very superior temporal and spatial resolution of MDCT has transformed CT imaging from a transaxial cross-sectional technique into an isotropic volume-imaging technique. MDCT facilitates multiphasic contrast-enhanced study for a wide range of body scanning in a single examination, as well as providing flexibility of multidirectional reconstruction and high-quality three-dimensional imaging. With increases in the number of detector rows year by year, systems with 64-detector rows have become commercially available in 2006. The purpose of this article is to review the status of CT imaging in oncological imaging: (1) to outline the impact of MDCT, focusing on oncological imaging and (2) to review the clinical applications of oncological CT imaging with MDCT",

abstract="PURPOSE: To perform stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) without cranially fixated stereotactic frames, we developed a dual computed tomography (CT) linear accelerator (linac) treatment unit. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This unit is composed of a linac, CT, and motorized table. The linac and CT are set up at opposite ends of the table, which is suitable for both machines. The gantry axis of the linac is coaxial with that of the CT scanner. Thus, the center of the target detected with the CT can be matched easily with the gantry axis of the linac by rotating the table. Positioning is confirmed with the CT for each treatment session. Positioning and treatment errors with this unit were examined by phantom studies. Between August and December 1994, 8 patients with 11 lesions of primary or metastatic brain tumors received SRT with this unit. All lesions were treated with 24 Gy in three fractions to 30 Gy in 10 fractions to the 80\% isodose line, with or without conventional external beam radiation therapy. RESULTS: Phantom studies revealed that treatment errors with this unit were within 1 mm after careful positioning. The position was easily maintained using two tiny metallic balls as vertical and horizontal marks. Motion of patients was negligible using a conventional heat-flexible head mold and dental impression. The overall time for a multiple noncoplanar arcs treatment for a single isocenter was less than 1 h on the initial treatment day and usually less than 20 min on subsequent days. Treatment was outpatient-based and well tolerated with no acute toxicities. Satisfactory responses have been documented. CONCLUSION: Using this treatment unit, multiple fractionated SRT is performed easily and precisely without cranially fixated stereotactic frames",

abstract="The DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PK(CS)) plays an important role during the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). It is recruited to DNA ends in the early stages of the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) process, which mediates DSB repair. To study DNA-PK(CS) recruitment in vivo, we used a laser system to introduce DSBs in a specified region of the cell nucleus. We show that DNA-PK(CS) accumulates at DSB sites in a Ku80-dependent manner, and that neither the kinase activity nor the phosphorylation status of DNA-PK(CS) influences its initial accumulation. However, impairment of both of these functions results in deficient DSB repair and the maintained presence of DNA-PK(CS) at unrepaired DSBs. The use of photobleaching techniques allowed us to determine that the kinase activity and phosphorylation status of DNA-PK(CS) influence the stability of its binding to DNA ends. We suggest a model in which DNA-PK(CS) phosphorylation/autophosphorylation facilitates NHEJ by destabilizing the interaction of DNA-PK(CS) with the DNA ends",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy is one of the recommended treatment options for localized prostate cancer. In randomized trials, dose escalation was correlated with better biochemical control but also with higher rectal toxicity. A prospective multicenter phase II study was carried out to evaluate the safety, clinical and dosimetric effects of the hydrogel prostate-rectum spacer. Here we present the 12 months toxicity results of this trial. METHODS: Fifty two patients with localized prostate cancer received a transperineal PEG hydrogel injection between the prostate and rectum, and then received IMRT to a dose of 78 Gy. Gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity were recorded during treatment and at 3, 6 and 12 months following irradiation by using the RTOG/EORTC criteria. Additionally, proctoscopy was performed 12 months after treatment and the results were scored using the Vienna Rectoscopy Scale (VRS). RESULTS: Of the patients treated 39.6\% and 12.5\% experienced acute Grade 1 and Grade 2 GI toxicity, respectively. There was no Grade 3 or Grade 4 acute GI toxicity experienced in the study. Only 4.3\% showed late Grade 1 GI toxicity, and there was no late Grade 2 or greater GI toxicity experienced in the study. A total of 41.7\%, 35.4\% and 2.1\% of the men experienced acute Grade 1, Grade 2 and Grade 3 GU toxicity, respectively. There was no Grade 4 acute GU toxicity experienced in the study. Late Grade 1 and Grade 2 GU toxicity was experienced in 17.0\% and 2.1\% of the patients, respectively. There was no late Grade 3 or greater GU toxicity experienced in the study. Seventy one percent of the patients had a VRS score of 0, and one patient (2\%) had Grade 3 teleangiectasia. There was no evidence of ulceration, stricture or necrosis at 12 months. CONCLUSION: The use of PEG spacer gel is a safe and effective method to spare the rectum from higher dose and toxicity",

abstract="PURPOSE: Single four-dimensional CT (4DCT) scans reliably capture intrafractional tumor mobility for radiotherapy planning, but generating internal target volumes (ITVs) requires the contouring of gross tumor volumes (GTVs) in up to 10 phases of a 4DCT scan, as is routinely performed in our department. We investigated the use of maximum intensity projection (MIP) protocols for rapid generation of ITVs. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 4DCT data from a mobile phantom and from 12 patients with Stage I lung cancer were analyzed. A single clinician contoured GTVs in all respiratory phases of a 4DCT, as well as in three consecutive phases selected for respiratory gating. MIP images were generated from both phantom and patient data, and ITVs were derived from encompassing volumes of the respective GTVs. RESULTS: In the phantom study, the ratio between ITVs generated from all 10 phases and those from MIP scans was 1.04. The corresponding center of mass of both ITVs differed by less than 1 mm. In scans from patients, good agreement was observed between ITVs derived from 10 and 3 (gating) phases and corresponding MIPs, with ratios of 1.07 +/- 0.05 and 0.98 +/- 0.05, respectively. In addition, the center of mass of the respective ITVs differed by only 0.4 and 0.5 mm. CONCLUSION: MIPs are a reliable clinical tool for generating ITVs from 4DCT data sets, thereby permitting rapid assessment of mobility for both gated and nongated 4D radiotherapy in lung cancer",

abstract="PURPOSE: To identify potential time trends in target volumes and tumor mobility after stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Repeat planning computed tomography (CT) scans were performed for 40 tumors during fractionated SRT delivered in either three (n = 21), five (n = 14), or eight fractions (n = 5). The planning CT scans used to define internal target volumes (ITVs) consisted of either six multislice CT scans or a single four-dimensional CT scan. All repeat CT scans were coregistered with the initial (D0) scan to determine volumetric or spatial changes in target volume, and tumor mobility vectors were determined from each scan. RESULTS: A significant decrease in target volumes (ITVs and gross tumor volumes) relative to baseline values was observed starting at the fourth week of SRT (p = 0.015). No trends in tumor mobility were detected during SRT. Significant positional shifts in the ITV, of more than 5 mm, were seen in 26-43\% of patients at different times during SRT. CONCLUSION: Significant changes in target volumes can occur during SRT for Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer. A failure to account for such changes e.g., by repeat CT planning or verification using on-board volumetric imaging can lead to inadequate target coverage",

abstract="High local control rates have been reported with stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer. Because high-dose fractions are used, reduction in treatment portals will reduce the risk of toxicity to adjacent structures. Respiratory gating can allow reduced field sizes and planning four-dimensional computed tomography scans were retrospectively analyzed to study the benefits for gated SRT and identify patients who derive significant benefit from this approach.Methods and Materials: A total of 31 consecutive patients underwent a four-dimensional computed tomography scan, in which three-dimensional computed tomography datasets for 10 phase bins of the respiratory cycle were acquired during free breathing. For a total of 34 tumors, the three planning target volumes (PTVs) were analyzed, namely (1) PTV10bins, derived from an internal target volume (ITV) that incorporated all observed mobility (ITV10bins), with the addition of a 3-mm isotropic setup margin; (2) PTVgating, derived from an ITV generated from mobility observed in three consecutive phases (``bins'') during tidal-expiration, plus addition of a 3-mm isotropic margin; and (3) PTV10 mm, derived from the addition of a 10-mm isotropic margin to the most central gross tumor volumes in the three bins selected for gating.Results: The PTV10bins and PTVgating were, on average, 48.2\% and 33.3\% of the PTV10 mm, and respective mean volumes of normal tissue (outside the PTV) receiving the prescribed doses were 57.1\% and 39.1\%, respectively, of that of PTV10 mm. A significant correlation was seen between the extent of tumor mobility (i.e., a three-dimensional mobility vector of at least 1 cm) and reduction in normal tissue irradiation achieved with gating. The ratio of the intersecting and the encompassing volumes of GTVs at extreme phases of tidal respiration predicted for the benefits of gated respiration.Conclusion: The use of ``standard population-based'' margins for SRT leads to unnecessary normal tissue irradiation. The risk of toxicity is further reduced if respiration-gated radiotherapy is used to treat mobile tumors. These findings suggest that gated SRT will be of clinical relevance in selected patients with mobile tumors",

abstract="Treatment plans optimized for intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) may be sensitive to range variations. The dose distribution may deteriorate substantially when the actual range of a pencil beam does not match the assumed range. We present two treatment planning concepts for IMPT which incorporate range uncertainties into the optimization. The first method is a probabilistic approach. The range of a pencil beam is assumed to be a random variable, which makes the delivered dose and the value of the objective function a random variable too. We then propose to optimize the expectation value of the objective function. The second approach is a robust formulation that applies methods developed in the field of robust linear programming. This approach optimizes the worst case dose distribution that may occur, assuming that the ranges of the pencil beams may vary within some interval. Both methods yield treatment plans that are considerably less sensitive to range variations compared to conventional treatment plans optimized without accounting for range uncertainties. In addition, both approaches--although conceptually different--yield very similar results on a qualitative level",

abstract="Treatment plans optimized for intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) may be very sensitive to setup errors and range uncertainties. If these errors are not accounted for during treatment planning, the dose distribution realized in the patient may by strongly degraded compared to the planned dose distribution. The authors implemented the probabilistic approach to incorporate uncertainties directly into the optimization of an intensity modulated treatment plan. Following this approach, the dose distribution depends on a set of random variables which parameterize the uncertainty, as does the objective function used to optimize the treatment plan. The authors optimize the expected value of the objective function. They investigate IMPT treatment planning regarding range uncertainties and setup errors. They demonstrate that incorporating these uncertainties into the optimization yields qualitatively different treatment plans compared to conventional plans which do not account for uncertainty. The sensitivity of an IMPT plan depends on the dose contributions of individual beam directions. Roughly speaking, steep dose gradients in beam direction make treatment plans sensitive to range errors. Steep lateral dose gradients make plans sensitive to setup errors. More robust treatment plans are obtained by redistributing dose among different beam directions. This can be achieved by the probabilistic approach. In contrast, the safety margin approach as widely applied in photon therapy fails in IMPT and is neither suitable for handling range variations nor setup errors",

abstract="Our method for predicting, and compensating for, the effects of surface irregularities and tissue heterogeneities in proton radiation therapy was evaluated by comparing the predicted and measured dose distributions. Two heterogeneity configurations in a D-shaped water-filled phantom were handled in exactly the same way as patients. Target volumes were designated on thin-section CT scans, a single en face portal was defined, compensating boli were designed and made, and the dose distribution behind the phantom measured and compared with that intended. The compensation was accurate to within 1 mm for the phantom with a single air heterogeneity and to within 2.5 mm for the phantom with multiple bone and air heterogeneities. The bolus and phantom were misaligned by 3 mm and the dramatic change in the dose distribution demonstrated the need to address the problems of patient motion and imperfect immobilisation through compensator design. A philosophy of 'expanding' the bolus is described, and dose distributions measured with the 'expanded' boli indicate that target volume treatment can be assured within prespecified repositioning and motion uncertainties. The uncertainty in the alignment of bolus and heterogeneities leads to corresponding uncertainty in the penetration of the protons. Ranges within which they will stop are calculated and shown to encompass adequately the measured distributions in both the aligned and misaligned cases",

abstract="The role of uncertainty analysis in 3-D treatment planning systems was addressed by four institutions which contracted with NCI to evaluate high energy photon external beam treatment planning. Treatment plans were developed at eight disease sites and the effects of uncertainties assessed in a number of experiments. Uncertainties which are patient-site specific included variations in the delineation of target volumes and normal tissues and the effects of positional uncertainties due to physiological motion and setup nonreproducibility. These were found to have a potentially major impact on the doses to the target volumes and to critical normal tissues which could result in significantly altered probabilities of tumor control and normal tissue complications. Other uncertainties, such as the conversion of CT data to electron densities, heterogeneities and dose calculation algorithms' weaknesses, are related to physical processes. The latter was noted to have the greatest potential contribution to uncertainty in some sites. A third category of uncertainty related to the treatment machine, the consequences of compensator misregistration, are exclusive to the site and the treatment portal. Because conventional treatment planning systems have not incorporated uncertainty analysis, tools and techniques had to be devised for this work; further development in this area is needed. Many of the analyses could not have been done without full 3-D capabilities of the planning systems, and it can be anticipated that the availability of uncertainty analysis in these systems which allow nontraditional beam arrangements will be of great value",

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A conformation number is introduced to evaluate objectively the degree of conformality. A comparison is made between the conformation number as found for external beam treatment plans and ultrasonically guided 125I seed implants for localized prostate cancer. RESULTS: The conformation number in case of a planning target volume irradiated with two opposed open beams, three open beams, and three beams with customized blocks amounted to 0.17, 0.39, and 0.65, respectively. The conformation number as found for ultrasonically guided permanent prostate implants using 125I seeds averaged 0.72.

abstract="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To determine the inter-observer variation in gross tumor volume (GTV) definition in lung cancer, and its clinical relevance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five clinicians involved in lung cancer were asked to define GTV on the planning CT scan of eight patients. Resulting GTVs were compared on the base of geometric volume, dimensions and extensions. Judgement of invasion of lymph node (LN) regions was evaluated using the ATS/LCSG classification of LN. Clinical relevance of the variation was studied through 3D-dosimetry of standard conformal plans: volume of critical organs (heart, lungs, esophagus, spinal cord) irradiated at toxic doses, 95\% isodose volumes of GTVs, normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP) and tumor control probabilities (TCP) were compared for evaluation of observer variability. RESULTS: Before evaluation of observer variability, critical review of planning CT scan led to up- (two cases) and downstaging (one case) of patients as compared to the respective diagnostic scans. The defined GTVs showed an inter-observer variation with a ratio up to more than 7 between maximum and minimum geometric content. The dimensions of the primary tumor had inter-observer ranges of 4.2 (transversal), 7.9 (cranio-caudal) and 5.4 (antero-posterior) cm. Extreme extensions of the GTVs (left, right, cranial, caudal, anterior and posterior) varied with ranges of 2.8-7.3 cm due to inter-observer variation. After common review, only 63\% of involved lymph node regions were delineated by the clinicians (i.e. 37\% are false negative). Twenty-two percent of drawn in lymph node regions were accepted to be false positive after review. In the conformal plans, inter-observer ranges of irradiated normal tissue volume were on average 12\%, with a maximum of 66\%. The probability (in the population of all conformal plans) of irradiating at least 95\% of the GTV with at least 95\% of the nominal treatment dose decreased from 96 to 88\% when swapping the matched GTV with an unmatched one. The average (over all patients) inter-observer range in NTCP varied from 5\% (spinal cord) to 20\% (ipsilateral lung), whereas the maximal ranges amounted 16\% (spinal cord) to 45\% (heart). The average TCP amounted 51\% with an average range of 2\% (maximally 5\%) in case of matched GTVs. These values shifted to 42\% (average TCP) with an average range of 14\% (maximally 31\%) when defining unmatched GTVs. Four groups of causes are suggested for the large inter-observer variation: (1) problems of methodology; (2) impossible differentiation between pathologic structures and tumor; or (3) between normal structures and tumor, and (4); lack of knowledge. Only the minority of these can be resolved objectively. For most of the causal factors agreements have to be made between clinicians, intra- and inter-departmentally. Some of the factors will never be unequivocally solved. CONCLUSIONS: GTV definition in lung cancer is one of the cornerstones in quality assurance of radiotherapy. The large inter-observer variation in GTV definition jeopardizes comparison between clinicians, institutes and treatments",

abstract="The potential of tumour tracking for active spot-scanned proton therapy was assessed. Using a 4D-dose calculation and simulated target motion, a tumour tracking algorithm has been implemented and applied to a simple target volume in both homogenous and heterogeneous in silico phantoms. For tracking and retracking (a hybrid solution combining tumour tracking and rescanning), three tracking modes were analysed: 'no tracking' (uncorrected irradiation of a moving target), 'perfect tracking' (no time delays and exact knowledge of target position) and 'imperfect tracking' (simulated time delays or position prediction errors). For all plans, dose homogeneity in the target volume was assessed as the difference between D5 and D95 in the CTV. For the homogeneous phantom, perfect tracking could retrieve nominal dose homogeneity for all motion phases and amplitudes while severe deterioration of treatment outcomes was found for imperfect tracking. The use of retracking reduced the sensitivity to position errors significantly in the homogeneous phantom. In the heterogeneous phantoms (simulated rib proximal to target), the nominal dose homogeneity could not be obtained with perfect tracking. Adjustments in pencil beam positions could cause pencil beams to deform under the influence of the bone, resulting in loss of dose homogeneity. As retracking was not capable of reducing these effects, rescanning provided the best treatment outcomes for moving heterogeneous targets in this study",

abstract="The aim of this paper is to study the correction of prostate motion and position during external beam therapy. The correction was performed using a commercially available ultrasound-based repositioning tool. Electronic portal imaging with the use of fiducial markers was used to assess efficacy and accuracy. Patients undergoing radiation treatment for adenocarcinoma of the prostate were enrolled in a positioning study. Fifteen patients had five to six gold fiducial markers implanted in their prostate. These patients were positioned daily in a standard manner and then were repositioned every other day using an ultrasound-based correction system. Every fraction of a patients' treatment was imaged. This yielded 156 image pairs with and 119 pairs without repositioning available for analysis. This group of patients with markers had the following residual positions measured after the use of ultrasound repositioning. A mean error of -0.4 mm (LL), -2.6 mm (CC), and +2.5 mm (AP) with a standard deviation of 4.3, 5.4, and 5.7 mm. In two directions the improvements of treatment using the ultrasound correction were smaller than the precision of this experiment. They were no larger than 0.81 mm (LAT), and 0.95 mm (CC). In the AP direction a significant improvement was found of 1.6 mm. A highly significant correlation (p < 0.001) was found between the residual errors in the cranio-caudal direction and the shifts performed on the basis of the ultrasound measurements (Spearman ranking R = 0.53). We presented a method to objectively estimate improvements by a correction scheme. This method applied to ultrasound-based adjustment showed significant improvement in one direction and no measurable improvement in two other directions",

abstract="Objective: To define prognostic parameters for patients with synchronous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Design: Retrospective study of period from 1970 through 1997. Patients: Patients with a single (n = 2,764) and synchronous NSCLC (n = 85) who underwent pulmonary resection. Methods: All tumors were classified postsurgically, and the tumors of the patients with synchronous lung cancer were staged separately. The most advanced tumor was used for comparison. Actuarial survival time was estimated, and risk factors influencing survival were evaluated. Patients who died within 30 days of surgery were excluded. Measurement and results: Five-year survival for single NSCLC was 41\% and for synchronous lung cancer it was 19\%. The relative risk of death for patients with synchronous lung cancer was 1.75, compared to that for patients with single lung cancer. The most advanced tumor in synchronous cancer was a significant predictor of survival (p < 0.005). The survival of patients with synchronous lung cancer in which the most advanced tumors were stage I (n = 40) and stage II (n = 27) was not different from that of patients with stage II (n = 834) and stage IIIA (n = 405) single lung cancer, respectively. Conclusion: The poorer survival of patients with synchronous NSCLC is confirmed and quantified. The stage of the most advanced tumor was the best predictor of prognosis. The prognosis of patients with synchronous NSCLC resembles the prognosis of patients with a single lung cancer of a higher stage. Upstaging in synchronous lung cancer is recommended on the basis of these observations",

abstract="SummaryBackground Up to 50\% of curative surgery for suspected non-small-cell lung cancer is unsuccessful. Accuracy of positron emission tomography (PET) with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) is thought to be better than conventional staging for diagnosis of this malignancy. Up to now however, there has been no evidence that PET leads to improved management of patients in routine clinical practice. We did a randomised controlled trial in patients with suspected non-small-cell lung cancer, who were scheduled for surgery after conventional workup, to test whether PET with 18FDG reduces number of futile thoracotomies.Methods Before surgery (mediastinoscopy or thoracotomy), 188 patients from nine hospitals were randomly assigned to either conventional workup (CWU) or conventional workup and PET (CWU+PET). Patients were followed up for 1 year. Thoracotomy was regarded as futile if the patient had benign disease, explorative thoracotomy, pathological stage IIIA-N2/IIIB, or postoperative relapse or death within 12 months of randomisation. The primary outcome measure was futile thoracotomy. Analysis was by intention to treat.Findings 96 patients were randomly assigned CWU and 92 CWU+PET. Two patients in the CWU+PET group did not undergo PET. 18 patients in the CWU group and 32 in the CWU+PET group did not have thoracotomy. In the CWU group, 39 (41\%) patients had a futile thoracotomy, compared with 19 (21\%) in the CWU+PET group (relative reduction 51\%, 95\% Cl 32-80\%; p=0[middle dot]003).Interpretation Addition of PET to conventional workup prevented unnecessary surgery in one out of five patients with suspected non-small-cell lung cancer",

abstract="For routine pretreatment verification of innovative treatment techniques such as (intensity modulated) dynamic arc therapy and helical TomoTherapy, an on-line and reliable method would be highly desirable. The present solution proposed by TomoTherapy, Inc. (Madison, WI) relies on film dosimetry in combination with up to two simultaneous ion chamber point dose measurements. A new method is proposed using a 2D ion chamber array (Seven29, PTW, Freiburg, Germany) inserted in a dedicated octagonal phantom, called Octavius. The octagonal shape allows easy positioning for measurements in multiple planes. The directional dependence of the response of the detector was primarily investigated on a dual energy (6 and 18 MV) Clinac 21EX (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) as no fixed angle incidences can be calculated in the Hi-Art TPS of TomoTherapy. The array was irradiated from different gantry angles and with different arc deliveries, and the dose distributions at the level of the detector were calculated with the AAA (Analytical Anisotropic Algorithm) photon dose calculation algorithm implemented in Eclipse (Varian). For validation on the 6 MV TomoTherapy unit, rotational treatments were generated, and dose distributions were calculated with the Hi-Art TPS. Multiple cylindrical ion chamber measurements were used to cross-check the dose calculation and dose delivery in Octavius in the absence of the 2D array. To compensate for the directional dependence of the 2D array, additional prototypes of Octavius were manufactured with built-in cylindrically symmetric compensation cavities. When using the Octavius phantom with a 2 cm compensation cavity, measurements with an accuracy comparable to that of single ion chambers can be achieved. The complete Octavius solution for quality assurance of rotational treatments consists of: The 2D array, two octagonal phantoms (with and without compensation layer), an insert for nine cylindrical ion chambers, and a set of inserts of various tissue equivalent materials of different densities. The combination of the 2D array with the Octavius phantom proved to be a fast and reliable method for pretreatment verification of rotational treatments. Quality control of TomoTherapy patients was reduced to a total of approximately 25 min per patient",

Recent research has elucidated the progressive nature of AF, including the structural and electrical remodelling that may become manifest if normal sinus rhythm is not restored, and the serious morbidities associated with long-term disease. The controversy over the merits of ventricular rate control vs. the restoration and maintenance of normal sinus rhythm in the treatment of AF has been explored in a number of large-scale, randomized clinical trials. The results of these trials suggest that whereas the two strategies may be equivalent for some patient populations, with both approaches requiring accompanying anticoagulation therapy, the restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm provide important haemodynamic as well as subjective benefits not afforded by rate control. Although early intervention to limit the progression of this arrhythmia is hindered by the limitations of existing anti-arrhythmic therapies, it is nevertheless a critical goal",

abstract="Quantitative validation of deformable image registration (DIR) algorithms is extremely difficult because of the complexity involved in constructing a deformable phantom that can duplicate various clinical scenarios. The purpose of this study is to describe a framework to test the accuracy of DIR based on computational modeling and evaluating using inverse consistency and other methods. Three clinically relevant organ deformations were created in prostate (distended rectum and rectal gas), head and neck (large neck flexion), and lung (inhale and exhale lung volumes with variable contrast enhancement) study sets. DIR was performed using both B-spline and diffeomorphic demons algorithms in the forward and inverse direction. A compositive accumulation of forward and inverse deformation vector fields was done to quantify the inverse consistency error (ICE). The anatomical correspondence of tumor and organs at risk was quantified by comparing the original RT structures with those obtained after DIR. Further, the physical characteristics of the deformation field, namely the Jacobian and harmonic energy, were computed to quantify the preservation of image topology and regularity of spatial transformation obtained in DIR. The ICE was comparable in prostate case but the B-spline algorithm had significantly better anatomical correspondence for rectum and prostate than diffeomorphic demons algorithm. The ICE was 6.5 mm for demons algorithm for head and neck case when compared to 0.7 mm for B-spline. Since the induced neck flexion was large, the average Dice similarity coefficient between both algorithms was only 0.87, 0.52, 0.81, and 0.67 for tumor, cord, parotids, and mandible, respectively. The B-spline algorithm accurately estimated deformations between images with variable contrast in our lung study, while diffeomorphic demons algorithm led to gross errors on structures affected by contrast variation. The proposed framework offers the application of known deformations on any image datasets, to evaluate the overall accuracy and limitations of a DIR algorithm used in radiation oncology. The evaluation based on anatomical correspondence, physical characteristics of deformation field, and image characteristics can facilitate DIR verification with the ultimate goal of implementing adaptive radiotherapy. The suitability of application of a particular evaluation metric in validating DIR is dependent on the clinical deformation observed",

abstract="PURPOSE: To describe dose-volume values with the use of water alone vs. a rectal balloon (RB) for the treatment of prostate cancer with proton therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 30 proton plans for 15 patients who underwent CT and MRI scans with an RB or water alone. Simulation was performed with a modified MRI endorectal coil and an RB with 100 mL of water or water alone. Doses of 78-82 gray equivalents were prescribed to the planning target volume. The two groups were compared for three structures: rectum, rectal wall (RW), and rectal wall 7 cm (RW7) at the level of the planning target volume. RESULTS: Rectum and RW volumes radiated to low, intermediate, and high doses were small: rectum V10, 33.7\%; V50, 17.3\%; and V70, 10.2\%; RW V10, 32.4\%; V50, 20.4\%; and V70, 14.6\%. The RB effectively increased the rectal volume for all cases (139.8 +/- 44.9 mL vs. 217.7 +/- 32.2 mL (p < 0.001). The RB also decreased the volume of the rectum radiated to doses V10-V65 (p < or = 0.05); RW for V10-V50; and RW7 for V10-V35. An absolute rectum V50 improvement >5\% was seen for the RB in 5 of 15 cases, for a benefit of 9.2\% +/- 2.3\% compared with 2.4\% +/- 1.3\% for the remaining 10 cases (p < 0.001). Similar benefit was seen for the rectal wall. No benefit was seen for doses > or =70 gray equivalents for the rectum, RW, or RW7. No benefit of < or =1\% was seen with an RB in 46\% for the rectum V70 and in 40\% for the rectal wall V70. CONCLUSIONS: Rectum and rectal wall doses with proton radiation were low whether using water or an RB. Selected patients will have a small but significant advantage with an RB; however, water alone was well tolerated and will be an alternative for most patients",

title="Acquiring a four-dimensional computed tomography dataset using an external respiratory signal",
journal="Physics in Medicine and Biology",

volume="48",
number="1",
pages="45--62",
abstract="Four-dimensional (4D) methods strive to achieve highly conformal radiotherapy, particularly for lung and breast tumours, in the presence of respiratory-induced motion of tumours and normal tissues. Four-dimensional radiotherapy accounts for respiratory motion during imaging, planning and radiation delivery, and requires a 4D CT image in which the internal anatomy motion as a function of the respiratory cycle can be quantified. The aims of our research were (a) to develop a method to acquire 4D CT images from a spiral CT scan using an external respiratory signal and (b) to examine the potential utility of 4D CT imaging. A commercially available respiratory motion monitoring system provided an \&lquot;external\&rquot; tracking signal of the patient\&rquot;s breathing. Simultaneous recording of a TTL \&lquot;X-Ray ON\&rquot; signal from the CT scanner indicated the start time of CT image acquisition, thus facilitating time stamping of all subsequent images. An over-sampled spiral CT scan was acquired using a pitch of 0.5 and scanner rotation time of 1.5 s. Each image from such a scan was sorted into an image bin that corresponded with the phase of the respiratory cycle in which the image was acquired. The complete set of such image bins accumulated over a respiratory cycle constitutes a 4D CT dataset. Four-dimensional CT datasets of a mechanical oscillator phantom and a patient undergoing lung radiotherapy were acquired. Motion artefacts were significantly reduced in the images in the 4D CT dataset compared to the three-dimensional (3D) images, for which respiratory motion was not accounted. Accounting for respiratory motion using 4D CT imaging is feasible and yields images with less distortion than 3D images. 4D images also contain respiratory motion information not available in a 3D CT image",

abstract="Adapting radiation delivery to respiratory motion is made possible through corrective action based on real-time feedback of target position during respiration. The advantage of this approach lies with its ability to allow tighter margins around the target while simultaneously following its motion. A significant hurdle to the successful implementation of real-time target-tracking-based radiation delivery is the existence of a finite time delay between the acquisition of target position and the mechanical response of the system to the change in position. Target motion during the time delay leads to a resultant lag in the system's response to a change in tumor position. Predicting target position in advance is one approach to ensure accurate delivery. The aim of this manuscript is to estimate the predictive ability of sinusoidal and adaptive filter-based prediction algorithms on multiple sessions of patient respiratory patterns. Respiratory motion information was obtained from recordings of diaphragm motion for five patients over 60 sessions. A prediction algorithm that employed both prediction models-the sinusoidal model and the adaptive filter model-was developed to estimate prediction accuracy over all the sessions. For each session, prediction error was computed for several time instants (response time) in the future (0-1.8 seconds at 0.2-second intervals), based on position data collected over several signal-history lengths (1-7 seconds at 1-second intervals). Based on patient data included in this study, the following observations are made. Qualitative comparison of predicted and actual position indicated a progressive increase in prediction error with an increase in response time. A signal-history length of 5 seconds was found to be the optimal signal history length for prediction using the sinusoidal model for all breathing training modalities. In terms of overall error in predicting respiratory motion, the adaptive filter model performed better than the sinusoidal model. With the adaptive filter, average prediction errors of less than 0.2 cm (1sigma) are possible for response times less than 0.4 seconds. In comparing prediction error with system latency error (no prediction), the adaptive filter model exhibited lesser prediction errors as compared to the sinusoidal model, especially for longer response time values (>0.4 seconds). At smaller response time values (<0.4 seconds), improvements in prediction error reduction are required for both predictive models in order to maximize gains in position accuracy due to prediction. Respiratory motion patterns are inherently complex in nature. While linear prediction-based prediction models perform satisfactorily for shorter response times, their prediction accuracy significantly deteriorates for longer response times. Successful implementation of real-time target-tracking-based radiotherapy requires response times less than 0.4 seconds or improved prediction algorithms",

abstract="Development and implementation of chronological and anti-chronological adaptive dose accumulation strategies in adaptive intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for head-and-neck cancer. An algorithm based on Newton iterations was implemented to efficiently compute inverse deformation fields (DFs). Four verification steps were performed to ensure a valid dose propagation: intra-cell folding detection finds zero or negative Jacobian determinants in the input DF; inter-cell folding detection is implemented on the resolution of the output DF; a region growing algorithm detects undefined values in the output DF; DF domains can be composed and displayed on the CT data. In 2011, one patient with nonmetastatic head and neck cancer selected from a three phase adaptive DPBN study was used to illustrate the algorithms implemented for adaptive chronological and anti-chronological dose accumulation. The patient received three (18)F-FDG-PET/CTs prior to each treatment phase and one CT after finalizing treatment. Contour propagation and DF generation between two consecutive CTs was performed in Atlas-based autosegmentation (ABAS). Deformable image registration based dose accumulations were performed on CT1 and CT4. Dose propagation was done using combinations of DFs or their inversions. We have implemented a chronological and anti-chronological dose accumulation algorithm based on DF inversion. Algorithms were designed and implemented to detect cell folding",

abstract="Purpose: To verify the technical feasibility of a prototype developed for breathing-synchronized irradiation by phantom measurement and report on the first clinical experience of 3 patients. Methods and Materials: Adaptations to a commercially available image-guidance technique (Novalis Body/ExacTrac4.0; BrainLAB AG, Heimstetten, Germany) were implemented, allowing breathing-synchronized irradiation with the Novalis system. A simple phantom simulating a breathing pattern of 16 cycles per minute and covering a distance of 4 cm was introduced to assess the system's performance to: (1) trigger the linac at the right moment (using a hidden target in the form of a 3-mm metal beads mounted to the phantom); (2) assess the delivered dose in nongated and gated mode (using an ionization chamber mounted to the phantom); (3) evaluate dose blurring and interplay between organ motion and leaf motion when applying dynamic multileaf collimation (DMLC) intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) techniques (using radiographic film mounted to the phantom). The effect of motion was evaluated by importing the measured fluence maps generated by the linac into the treatment planning system and recalculating the resulting dose distribution from DMLC IMRT fluence patterns acquired in nongated and gated mode. The synchronized-breathing technique was applied to three clinical cases: one liver metastasis, one lung metastasis, and one primary lung tumor. Results: No measurable delay in the triggering of the linac can be observed based on the hidden target test. The ionization chamber measurements showed that the system is able to improve the dose absorption from 44\% (in nongated mode) to 98\% (in gated mode) for a small field irradiation (3 x 3 cm(2)) of a moving target. Importing measured fluence maps generated for a realistic patient treatment and actually delivered by the linac into the treatment planning system yielded highly disturbed dose distributions in nongated delivery, whereas the gated delivery showed good agreement with the original theoretical dose distribution. These findings were confirmed by dose-volume histograms. The three different clinical cases revealed three different practical problems that could easily be resolved by minor adjustments to the system. The applied breathing-synchronization technique introduced an increased treatment time by a factor of 3 to 4. Conclusions: Initial tests with the prototype for breathing-synchronized irradiation showed promising results. The use of measured fluence fields, delivered by the linac in nongated and gated mode as imported fluence maps for the treatment planning system, revealed the dramatic impact of dose blurring and interplay between leaf motion and organ motion, as well as the advantage of breathing synchronization to resolve this issue. The latter should, however, be weighed against the increased treatment time",

abstract="The limited ability to control for the location of a tumour compromises the accuracy with which radiation can be delivered to tumour-bearing tissue. The resultant requirement for larger treatment volumes to accommodate target uncertainty restricts the radiation dose because more surrounding normal tissue is exposed. With image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) these volumes can be optimized and tumoricidal doses can be delivered, achieving maximal tumour control with minimal complications. Moreover, with the ability of high-precision dose delivery and real-time knowledge of the target volume location, IGRT has initiated the exploration of new indications for radiotherapy, some of which were previously considered infeasible",

Material and methods: A prototype X-ray imaging tool has been integrated with a commercially released real-time infrared tracking device. The system, consisting of two X-ray tubes mounted to the ceiling and a centrally located amorphous silicon detector has been developed for automated patient positioning from outside the treatment room prior to treatment. Two major functions are supported: (a) automated fusion of the actual treatment images with digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) representing the desired position; (b) matching of implanted radio opaque markers. Measurements of known translational (up to 30.0 mm) and rotational (up to 4.0[degree sign]) set-up errors in three dimensions as well as hidden target tests have been performed on anthropomorphic phantoms. Results: The system's accuracy can be represented with the mean three-dimensional displacement vector, which yielded 0.6 mm (with an overall SD of 0.9 mm) for the fusion of DRRs and X-ray images. Average deviations between known translational errors and calculations varied from -0.3 to 0.6 mm with a standard deviation in the range of 0.6-1.2 mm. The marker matching algorithm yielded a three-dimensional uncertainty of 0.3 mm (overall SD: 0.4 mm), with averages ranging from 0.0 to 0.3 mm and a standard deviation in the range between 0.3 and 0.4 mm. Conclusions: The stereoscopic X-ray imaging device integrated with the real-time infrared tracking device represents a positioning tool allowing for the geometrical accuracy that is required for conformal radiation therapy of abdominal and pelvic lesions, within an acceptable time-frame",

abstract="PURPOSE: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a costly new technology with potential to improve preoperative evaluation for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There is increasing pressure for PET to be included in standard diagnostic work-up before decisions about surgical management of NSCLC. The resource implications of its widespread use in staging NSCLC are significant. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted to investigate the impact of PET on clinical management and surgical outcomes for patients with stage I-II NSCLC. The primary hypothesis was that PET would reduce the proportion of patients with stage I-II NSCLC who underwent thoracotomy by at least 10\% through identification of patients with inoperable disease. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-four patients with stage I-II NSCLC were recruited and randomly assigned; 92\% had stage I disease. Following exclusion of one ineligible patient, 92 patients were assigned to no PET and 91 to PET. Compared with conventional staging, PET upstaged 22 patients, confirmed staging in 61 and staged two patients as benign. Stage IV disease was rarely detected (two patients). PET led to further investigation or a change in clinical management in 13\% of patients and provided information that could have affected management in a further 13\% of patients. There was no significant difference between the trial arms in the number of thoracotomies avoided (P = .2). CONCLUSION: For patients who are carefully and appropriately staged as having stage I-II disease, PET provides potential for more appropriate stage-specific therapy but may not lead to a significant reduction in the number of thoracotomies avoided",

abstract="OBJECTIVE: Recent observations have been shown that the induction and accumulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) by short exposure to nonlethal whole-body hyperthermia with normothermic recovery are closely associated with transient resistance to subsequent ischemia-reperfusion challanges. Here, this study was performed to investigate whether a shortly heat shock pretreatment affects the left ventricular (LV) function after cold cardioplegic ischemia in reperfused neonatal rabbit hearts. METHODS: Hearts from neonatal New Zealand White rabbits were isolated perfused (working heart preparation) and exposed to 2 h of cold cardioplegic ischemia followed by reperfusion for 60 min. To induce the heat shock response neonatal rabbits (n=5, HT-group) were subjected to whole-body hyperthermia at 42.0-42.5 degrees C for 15 min, followed by a normothermic recovery period of 60 min, before harvesting and the onset of global hypothermic cardioplegic arrest. Another set of hearts (n=5, control group) without a heat treatment underwent a similar perfusion and ischemia protocol served as control. The postischemic recovery was assessed by measuring several parameters of LV function. LV biopsies from all control and heat treated animals were taken before ischemia and at the end of reperfusion to examine myocardial HSP levels by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: At 60 min of reperfusion the HT-group showed significant better recovery of ventricular function such as LV developed pressure (DP) (74.6+/-10 vs. 52.1+/-8.5\%, P<0.05), LV positive dP/dt (910+/-170 vs. 530+/-58 mmHg/s, P<0.01) and LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) (8+/-2 vs. 18.4+/-5 mmHg, P<0.05) than control. Myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO(2)) was significantly higher in the HT-group compared with control (0.054+/-0.006 vs. 0.041+/-0.002 ml/g per min, P<0.05). Significant postreperfusion lower level in lactate production was observed in the HT-group (0.83+/-0.11 vs. 1.67+/-0.8 mmol/l, P<0.05). Also, the recovery of hemodynamic parameters such as aortic flow, coronary flow and cardiac output was significantly superior (P<0.05) in the HT-group. Furthermore, high expression of HSP72(+)/73(+) were detected in the myocardial tissue samples of heat-treated rabbits by immunoblotting, appearing even at 60 min of normothermic recovery after heat stress. CONCLUSIONS: These data in the immature rabbit heart indicate that previous shortly heat treatment with high level expression of heat shock proteins (HSP72(+)/73(+)) before hypothermic cardioplegic ischemia provides transient tolerance against myocardial injury and could be an improvement for the postischemic functional recovery of neonatal hearts",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Recent findings indicate that molecular chaperones actively participate in myocardial cytoprotection. Moreover, ischemic tolerance can be induced in humans by brief ischemic events. Therefore, we investigated patients with severe angina attacks before coronary artery bypass grafting. We focused on appearance of anti-hsp70 antibodies as an immunologic response to heat shock protein induction by ischemia followed up by hemodynamic measurements perioperatively. We correlated these clinical findings with the presence of antibodies against hsp70 and the antioxidative capacity of patients' sera. METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive patients with coronary artery disease scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting were included. Seventeen patients had severe angina, and 18 patients suffered from chronic stable angina preoperatively. In the patients' sera, antibodies against hsp70 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and antioxidative capacity was detected using the chromogen assay. Cardiac output and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were measured using a thermodilution catheter. We also evaluated C-reactive protein and creatine kinase MB isoenzyme, and performed a conventional leukocyte count. RESULTS: The sera of the 17 patients with severe angina attacks before surgery contained antibodies against hsp70 and a low antioxidative capacity. The interval between a severe angina attack and anti-hsp70 antibody titer are inversely correlated. These patients had better cardiac output and lower pulmonary capillary wedge pressure values after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Severe angina before cardiac surgery coincided with an improved outcome as measured by hemodynamic variables as compared with chronic stable angina. This finding correlated significantly with a low antioxidative capacity and the presence of antibodies against hsp70. These pathophysiologic mechanisms might therefore play a role in myocardial protection",

abstract="BACKGROUND: The capacity of heat stress induction to improve myocardial tolerance against ischemia is well known. We investigated cardiac energy metabolism after hsp 72(+)/73(+) induction in isolated perfused neonatal rabbit hearts subjected to prolonged cold cardioplegic ischemia. METHODS: Hearts from neonatal rabbits were excised, isolated perfused and arrested by 2-h cold cardioplegic ischemia. Rectal temperature of eight neonatal rabbits was raised to 42.0 to 42.5 degrees C for heat shock protein expression in a whole body water bath for 15 min before the onset of arrest. Another set of eight rabbits without hyperthermia pretreatment served as control. Recovery of left ventricle function was assessed by aortic flow, cardiac output, and max dP/dt. Status of high-energy phosphates was measured by (31)phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance-spectroscopy. RESULTS: Immunoblot analysis revealed clear hsp 72+/73+ induction after a brief period of systemic hyperthermia. Heat stress pretreatment resulted in a better recovery of left ventricular function (aortic flow and cardiac output improvement P < 0.05, max dP/dt P < 0.01) than in controls at 60 min after reperfusion. During ischemia and reperfusion, myocardial energy metabolism was better preserved in hearts after hsp induction as a consequence of increased gamma-, alpha-, and beta-ATP as well as phosphocreatine-values over controls. The ischemia-induced pH-decrease was attenuated. CONCLUSION: These data contribute to the evidence of heat stress mediated beneficial effects on functional myocardial recovery and improved cardiac energy metabolism after prolonged cold cardioplegic ischemia. More importantly, the attenuation of ischemic pH reduction and better restoration suggest an involvement of mitochondrial membrane potential alterations",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Respiratory complications after cardiosurgical interventions are frequent and cause severe problems, postoperatively. The present study addresses the question for group-specific release of radical oxygen species (ROS) by extracorporeal circulation (ECC) with emphasis on pulmonary function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients who had undergone bypass surgery were evaluated for serum antioxidative capacity (AOC). Blood gas analysis, leukocyte counts, C-reactive protein (CRP), and hemodynamic data cardiac output (CO), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) arterial-alveolar gradient (AaDO(2)), and Murray scores were measured after ECC up to 48 h. According to AOC levels at baseline before ECC, patients were divided into two groups (group A: ``high'' AOC equal to or above median of the whole sample; n=26; versus group B: ``low'' AOC below median; n=25). RESULTS: A different time course in AOC could be detected between both groups. Both groups had an improvement in postoperative cardiac output evaluation, but in group A (high AOC) the PCWP was reduced (P=0.015). In this group, an increased AaDO(2) and elevated Murray score were seen 12 h postoperatively (P<0.001), suggesting reduced oxygen uptake. Moreover, increased CRP values and a trend to reduced leukocyte counts indicate differences in amplified inflammatory response to ECC. CONCLUSIONS: Free radical production after ECC is not a uniform process. Preoperative differences in AOC indicate interindividual variations. The surgical trauma results in a clear decrease of AOC in group A, while in group B AOC showed no major changes. As shown for reduced PCWP, release of ROS can affect pulmonary function. Therefore, AOC may be a useful parameter for prediction of postoperative complications",

abstract="PURPOSE: A prospective comparative study of a subset of 10 consecutive patients was performed, to describe the effects of an air-inflated rectal balloon tube that has been used for prostate immobilization in 360 patients since 1994. In particular, influences on prostate motion, rectum filling variations, and dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of the rectum during a course of conformal radiotherapy were investigated. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Computed tomographic (CT) examinations without and with rectal balloon (filled with 40 mL air) were performed at the start (t(0)), middle (t(mi)), and end of treatment (t(e)), resulting in 6 CT scans for each patient. Prostate displacement was measured from a lateral beam's-eye-view. DVHs of rectum as a solid organ, and anterior, posterior, and whole rectum wall were calculated at t(0), t(mi), and t(e), and variations during treatment were analyzed for both examinations, with and without balloon. RESULTS: By use of the balloon, rectum filling variations (p = 0.04) and maximum anterior-posterior displacements of the prostate (p = 0.008) were reduced significantly, leading to a reduction in DVH variations during treatment. Maximum displacements of posterior prostate border (>5 mm) were found in 8/10 patients without a rectum balloon and in only 2/10 patients with the balloon. The balloon led to a significant reduction in partial posterior rectal wall volumes included in the high-dose regions, without significant changes at the anterior rectum wall in cases of irradiation of the prostate only. However, when entirely irradiating the whole seminal vesicles, this advantage was lost. CONCLUSIONS: The rectal balloon catheter represents a simple technique to immobilize the prostate and to determine the position of the anterior rectal wall at daily treatment. This allows a reduction of margins, because of reduced prostate movement during treatment course",

abstract="This paper summarises the conclusions of a working group established jointly by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) to address some of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) issues encountered in ion-beam therapy. Special emphasis is put on the selection and definition of the involved quantities and units. The isoeffective dose, as introduced here for radiation therapy applications, is the dose that delivered under reference conditions would produce the same clinical effects as the actual treatment in a given system, all other conditions being identical. It is expressed in Gy. The reference treatment conditions are: photon irradiation, 2 Gy per fraction, 5 daily fractions a week. The isoeffective dose D(IsoE) is the product of the physical quantity absorbed dose D and a weighting factor W(IsoE). W(IsoE) is an inclusive weighting factor that takes into account all factors that could influence the clinical effects like dose per fraction, overall time, radiation quality (RQ), biological system and effects. The numerical value of W(IsoE) is selected by the radiation-oncology team for a given patient (or treatment protocol). It is part of the treatment prescription. Evaluation of the influence of RQ on W(IsoE) raises complex problems because of the clinically significant RBE variations with biological effect (late vs. early) and position in depth in the tissues which is a problem specific to ion-beam therapy. Comparison of the isoeffective dose with the equivalent dose frequently used in proton- and ion-beam therapy is discussed",

abstract="A greyscale-based fully automatic deformable image registration algorithm, originally known as the \&lsquo;demons\&rsquo; algorithm, was implemented for CT image-guided radiotherapy. We accelerated the algorithm by introducing an \&lsquo;active force\&rsquo; along with an adaptive force strength adjustment during the iterative process. These improvements led to a 40\% speed improvement over the original algorithm and a high tolerance of large organ deformations. We used three methods to evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm. First, we created a set of mathematical transformations for a series of patient?s CT images. This provides a \&lsquo;ground truth\&rsquo; solution for quantitatively validating the deformable image registration algorithm. Second, we used a physically deformable pelvic phantom, which can measure deformed objects under different conditions. The results of these two tests allowed us to quantify the accuracy of the deformable registration. Validation results showed that more than 96\% of the voxels were within 2 mm of their intended shifts for a prostate and a head-and-neck patient case. The mean errors and standard deviations were 0.5 mm \${\backslash}pm\$ 1.5 mm and 0.2 mm \${\backslash}pm\$ 0.6 mm, respectively. Using the deformable pelvis phantom, the result showed a tracking accuracy of better than 1.5 mm for 23 seeds implanted in a phantom prostate that was deformed by inflation of a rectal balloon. Third, physician-drawn contours outlining the tumour volumes and certain anatomical structures in the original CT images were deformed along with the CT images acquired during subsequent treatments or during a different respiratory phase for a lung cancer case. Visual inspection of the positions and shapes of these deformed contours agreed well with human judgment. Together, these results suggest that the accelerated demons algorithm has significant potential for delineating and tracking doses in targets and critical structures during CT-guided radiotherapy",

abstract="PURPOSE: To quantify intrafraction prostate motion between patient groups treated with and without daily endorectal balloon (ERB) employed during prostate radiotherapy and establish the effectiveness of the ERB. METHODS: Real-time intrafraction prostate motion from 29 non-ERB (1,061 sessions) and 30 ERB (1,008 sessions) patients was evaluated based on three-dimensional (3D), left, right, cranial, caudal, anterior, and posterior displacements. The average percentage of time with 3D and unidirectional prostate displacements >2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 mm in 1-min intervals was calculated for up to 6 min of treatment time. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov method was used to evaluate the intrafraction prostate motion pattern between both groups. RESULTS: Large 3D motion (up to 1 cm or more) was only observed in the non-ERB group. The motion increased as a function of elapsed time for displacements >2-8 mm for the non-ERB group and >2-4 mm for the ERB group (p < 0.05). The percentage time distributions between the two groups were significantly different for motion >5 mm (p < 0.05). The 3D symmetrical internal margin (IM) can be reduced from 5 to 3 mm (40\% reduction), whereas the asymmetrical IM can be reduced from 3 to 2 mm (33\% reduction) in cranial, caudal, anterior, and posterior for 6 min of treatment, when ERB is used. Beyond 6 min, the symmetrical 3D and asymmetrical cranial, caudal, anterior, and posterior IMs can be reduced from 9, 4, 7, 7, and 8 to 5, 2, 5, 3, and 4 mm, respectively (up to 57\% reduction). CONCLUSION: The percentage of time that the prostate was displaced in any direction was less in the ERB group for almost all magnitudes of motion considered. The directional analysis shows that the ERB reduced IMs in almost all directions, especially the anterior-posterior direction",

METHODS: Total and anterior stool/gas rectal volumes were quantified in 30 patients treated with daily ERB. Real-time intrafraction prostate motion from 494 treatment sessions, at most 6 min in length, was evaluated using Calypso((R)) tracking system. RESULTS: The deviation of prostate intrafraction motion distribution was a function of stool/gas volume, especially when stool/gas is located in the anterior part of the rectum. Compared to patients with small anterior stool/gas volumes (<10 cm(3)), those with large volume (10-60 cm(3)) had a twofold increase in 3D prostate motion and interquartile data range within the 6th minute of treatment time. The 10\% of the overall CBCT session where large anterior rectal volumes were observed demonstrated larger percentage of time at displacement greater than our proposed internal margin 3 mm. CONCLUSION: Volume and location of stool/gas can directly impact the ERB's intrafraction immobilization ability. Although our patient preparation protocol and the 100 cm(3) daily ERB effectively stabilized prostate motion for 90\% of the fractions, a larger-sized ERB may improve prostate fixation for patients with greater and/or variable daily rectal volume",

abstract="The optimization of intensity distributions and the delivery of intensity-modulated treatments with dynamic multi-leaf collimators (MLC) offer important improvements to three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. In this study, a nine-beam intensity-modulated prostate plan was generated using the inverse radiotherapy technique. The resulting fluence profiles were converted into dynamic MLC leaf motions as functions of monitor units. The leaf motion pattern data were then transferred to the MLC control computer and were used to guide the motions of the leaves during irradiation. To verify that the dose distribution predicted by the optimization and planning systems was actually delivered, a homogeneous polystyrene phantom was irradiated with each of the nine intensity-modulated beams incident normally on the phantom. For each exposure, a radiographic film was placed normal to the beam in the phantom to record the deposited dose. The films were calibrated and scanned to generate 2-D isodose distributions. The dose was also calculated by convolving the incident fluence pattern with pencil beams. The measured and calculated dose distributions were compared and found to have discrepancies in excess of 5\% of the central axis dose. The source of discrepancies was suspected to be the rounded edges of the leaves and the scattered radiation from the various components of the collimation system. After approximate corrections were made for these effects, the agreement between the two dose distributions was within 2\%. We also studied the impact of the ``tongue-and-groove'' effect on dynamic MLC treatments and showed that it is possible to render this effect inconsequential by appropriately synchronizing leaf motions. This study also demonstrated that accurate and rapid delivery of realistic intensity-modulated plans is feasible using a dynamic multi-leaf collimator",

abstract="PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to explore the use of the accelerated exhaustive search strategy for developing and validating methods for optimizing beam orientations for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Combining beam-angle optimization (BAO) with intensity distribution optimization is expected to improve the quality of IMRT treatment plans. However, BAO is one of the most difficult problems to solve adequately because of the huge hyperspace of possible beam configurations (e.g., selecting 7 of 36 uniformly spaced coplanar beams would require the intercomparison of 8,347,680 IMRT plans). METHODS AND MATERIALS: An ``influence vector'' (IV) approximation technique for high-speed estimation of IMRT dose distributions was used in combination with a fast gradient search algorithm (Newton's method) for IMRT optimization. In the IV approximation, it is assumed that the change in intensity of a ray (or bixel) proportionately changes dose along the ray. Evidence is presented that the IV approximation is valid for BAO. The scatter contribution at points away from the ray is accounted for fully in IMRT optimization after the optimum beam orientation has been determined. IVs for all candidate beam angles are generated before the start of optimization. For all subsets of beams selected from a given pool of beams (e.g., 5 of 24 uniformly spaced beams), the distribution of planning scores for the best and the worst plans, optimum angle distributions, dose distributions, and dose-volume histograms (DVH) were analyzed for one prostate and two lung cancer cases. The results of the exhaustive search technique were used to develop a ``multiresolution'' search strategy. In this approach, a smaller number of beams (e.g., three) is first used to explore the hyperspace of solutions to determine the most preferred and the least preferred directions. The results of such exploration are then used as a starting point for determining an optimum configuration comprising a larger number of beams (e.g., seven). This two-step process is considerably faster than full exhaustive search. The question to be answered was whether the two methods lead to the same or similar solutions. The results of exhaustive search and multiresolution approaches were also compared with a previously published approach that used beam's-eye-view dosimetrics (BEVD). RESULTS: The relative ranks of plans optimized by an accurate dose calculation method were highly correlated with those of the plans optimized by the fast calculation method (i.e., using the IV approximation), which suggests that an approximate dose calculation algorithm can be used effectively for ranking of plans during BAO. We found that dose distributions and DVH of many beam configurations within a specified subset from a given pool of beams (e.g., 5 of 18) may be clinically indistinguishable and acceptable. Their optimized IMRT scores fall in a narrow range, although beam configurations and dose distributions may be different. We used the frequency distributions as a function of beam angles for the best 100 and the worst 100 plans to determine the most and the least preferred beam angles. We found that the most and the least preferred angle distributions for 3 of 18 configurations were very similar to those for 5, 6, 7, or 8 of 18 or 24 configurations, but the size of the search space was much smaller for the 3 of 18 case. Using fewer than three beams was discovered to be inadequate. This information was used to select the most preferred angles and eliminate the least preferred ones before searching for the optimum angles for the remaining beams. For the cases we studies, the multiresolution strategy produced very similar results to the full exhaustive search. Based on the observation that the worst plans had at least one parallel-opposed pair of beams and virtually all of the best plans had none, we were able to further reduce the size of the search space dramatically by using a pool of only nonparallel-opposed equispaced beams (i.e., 7 of 19 instead of 7 of 36). Another observation was that the probability of finding an optimum configuration in a smaller beam pool is substantially lower than in a larger pool (e.g., 5 of 18 vs. 5 of 24). The implication of this BAO is not very important when a large number of beams (nine or more) is used and vice versa. Our results showed that the plans with fewer but optimally placed beams could be as good as or better than plans using a larger number of unoptimized or uniformly placed beams. CONCLUSION: Exhaustive search with fast IMRT algorithms provides a novel and realistic approach to study the characteristics of IMRT dose distributions as a function of beam angles and to design practical BAO strategies for IMRT planning",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is considered a terminal illness with a five-year survival rate of about 16\%. Informed decision-making related to the management of a disease requires accurate prognosis of the disease with or without treatment. Despite the significance of disease prognosis in clinical decision-making, systematic assessment of prognosis in patients with lung cancer without treatment has not been performed. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the natural history of patients with confirmed diagnosis of lung cancer without active treatment, to provide evidence-based recommendations for practitioners on management decisions related to the disease. Specifically, we estimated overall survival when no anticancer therapy is provided. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by search of electronic databases and abstract proceedings, review of bibliographies of included articles, and contacting experts in the field. All prospective or retrospective studies assessing prognosis of lung cancer patients without treatment were eligible for inclusion. Data on mortality was extracted from all included studies. Pooled proportion of mortality was calculated as a back-transform of the weighted mean of the transformed proportions using the random-effects model. To perform meta-analysis of median survival, published methods were used to pool the estimates as mean and standard error under the random-effects model. Methodological quality of the studies was examined. RESULTS: Seven cohort studies (4,418 patients) and 15 randomized controlled trials (1,031 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. All studies assessed mortality without treatment in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The pooled proportion of mortality without treatment in cohort studies was 0.97 (95\% CI: 0.96 to 0.99) and 0.96 in randomized controlled trials (95\% CI: 0.94 to 0.98) over median study periods of eight and three years, respectively. When data from cohort and randomized controlled trials were combined, the pooled proportion of mortality was 0.97 (95\% CI: 0.96 to 0.98). Test of interaction showed a statistically non-significant difference between subgroups of cohort and randomized controlled trials. The pooled mean survival for patients without anticancer treatment in cohort studies was 11.94 months (95\% CI: 10.07 to 13.8) and 5.03 months (95\% CI: 4.17 to 5.89) in RCTs. For the combined data (cohort studies and RCTs), the pooled mean survival was 7.15 months (95\% CI: 5.87 to 8.42), with a statistically significant difference between the two designs. Overall, the studies were of moderate methodological quality. CONCLUSION: Systematic evaluation of evidence on prognosis of NSCLC without treatment shows that mortality is very high. Untreated lung cancer patients live on average for 7.15 months. Although limited by study design, these findings provide the basis for future trials to determine optimal expected improvement in mortality with innovative treatments",

abstract="Ionizing radiation causes both singly and multiply damaged sites in DNA when the range of radical migration is limited by the presence of hydroxyl radical scavengers (e.g. within cells). Multiply damaged sites are considered to be more biologically relevant because of the challenges they present to cellular repair mechanisms. These sites occur in the form of DNA double-strand breaks (dsb) but also as other multiple damages that can be converted to dsb during attempted repair. The presence of a dsb can lead to loss of base sequence information and/or can permit the two ends of a break to separate and rejoin with the wrong partner. (Multiply damaged sites may also be the biologically relevant type of damage caused by other agents, such as UVA, B and/or C light, and some antitumour antibiotics.) The quantitative data available from radiation studies of DNA are shown to support the proposed mechanisms for the production of complex damage in cellular DNA, i.e. via scavengable and non-scavengable mechanisms. The yields of complex damages can in turn be used to support the conclusion that cellular mutations are a consequence of the presence of these damages within a gene. Literature data are used to support these statements and to develop overall mechanisms connecting the production of primary species to the production of biologically relevant damages. The consequences of the LET of the radiation on multiplicity of damage are discussed and suggestions made for the cause of the decrease of the oxygen enhancement ratio as the LET increases",

abstract="A major remaining problem in delivering radiotherapy, specifically intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), is the need to accommodate and correct for intrafraction movement. The developing availability of 4D computed tomographic images can potentially form the basis of the new field of image-guided IMRT. It is important to understand the effects on delivered dose of the patient breathing during IMRT and this paper models the effect which applies whether there is or is not a time component to the IMRT delivery method. It then goes on to suggest a practical correction strategy. The \&lsquo;stretch-and-shift-the-planned-modulations\&rsquo; strategy is proposed and a practical method to deliver this is explained. This practical strategy is based on a modification of the dynamic multileaf collimator IMRT method whereby the leaves are arranged to \&lsquo;breath\&rsquo; in tandem with the breathing of the patient. Some examples are also given from a study of mismatching the patient and leaf-correction motions",

abstract="Intrafraction organ motion disturbs the otherwise highly conformal dose distributions planned for conformal radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy. If the organ motions are rigid-body translations and preserve voxel density, techniques to make the beam follow the target by synchronous breathing can be arranged. Several potential difficulties disturb this oversimple statement and one of these is addressed in this paper. The effects of general elastic motion without preserving density are investigated. The effects are complex. Dose-space voxels disconnect from the planned irradiation bixel; voxels in a set aligned with a particular bixel cease to be so aligned even with a different bixel on elastic motion. Furthermore the density changes to conserve mass and this further perturbs the dose distribution. These effects are demonstrated here via simple examples but it may be impossible to make \&lsquo;beam-breathing\&rsquo; strategies to compensate for them. Consequently understanding (and possibly ignoring) these second-order effects may be all that is possible",

Since the introduction of highly accurate conformal radiation therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) attention has focused strongly in the last few years on understanding and compensating more appropriately for these motions. Thus, unlike most of the reviews in this special 50th anniversary issue which look back over decades of development, this one looks back at most within just the past decade and reviews the current situation.

abstract="To assess the clinical results of spot scanning proton beam radiation therapy (PT) in the treatment of skull base chordomas and low-grade chondrosarcomas (CS).Methods and Materials: Between October 1998 and October 2003, 29 patients (median age, 39 years) with chordomas (n = 18) and CS (n = 11) were treated at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) with protons using the main 510-MeV cyclotron. Tumor conformal application of proton beams was realized by spot scanning technology. The median chordoma and CS dose was 74 and 68 cobalt Gy equivalent, respectively (cobalt Gy equivalent = proton Gy \&\#x00d7; 1.1). Median gross tumor volumes (GTV) were 16.4 mL (range, 1.8-48.1 mL) and 15.2 mL (range, 2.3-57.3 mL) for chordoma and CS, respectively. Late toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v3.0) grading system. The median follow-up time was 29 months (range, 6-68 months).Results: Actuarial 3-year local control rates were 87.5\% and 100\% for chordoma and CS, respectively. We observed one surgical pathway and one marginal failure in patients with chordomas. No regional failure or distant metastasis was observed. At 3 years, actuarial PFS and OS for the entire cohort was 90\% and 93.8\%, respectively. Actuarial 3-year complication-free survival was 82.2\%. Radiation-induced pituitary dysfunction was observed in 4 (14\%) patients (CTCAE Grade 2). No patient presented with post-PT brainstem or optic pathways necrosis or dysfunction. In univariate analysis, age p = 0.09).Conclusion: Spot-scanning PT offers high tumor control rates of skull base chordoma and CS. These results compare favorably to other combined proton-photon or carbon ion irradiation series. Observed toxicity was acceptable. Younger age (<=40 years) was a favorable prognostic factor of PFS. These preliminary results are encouraging but should be confirmed during a longer follow-up",

abstract="PURPOSE: Rectal toxicity is a serious adverse effect in early-stage prostate cancer patients treated with curative radiation therapy (RT). Injecting a spacer between Denonvilliers' fascia increases the distance between the prostate and the anterior rectal wall and may thus decrease the rectal radiation-induced toxicity. We assessed the dosimetric impact of this spacer with advanced delivery RT techniques, including intensity modulated RT (IMRT), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and intensity modulated proton beam RT (IMPT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eight prostate cancer patients were simulated for RT with or without spacer. Plans were computed for IMRT, VMAT, and IMPT using the Eclipse treatment planning system using both computed tomography spacer+ and spacer- data sets. Prostate +/- seminal vesicle planning target volume [PTV] and organs at risk (OARs) dose-volume histograms were calculated. The results were analyzed using dose and volume metrics for comparative planning. RESULTS: Regardless of the radiation technique, spacer injection decreased significantly the rectal dose in the 60- to 70-Gy range. Mean V(70 Gy) and V(60 Gy) with IMRT, VMAT, and IMPT planning were 5.3 +/- 3.3\%/13.9 +/- 10.0\%, 3.9 +/- 3.2\%/9.7 +/- 5.7\%, and 5.0 +/- 3.5\%/9.5 +/- 4.7\% after spacer injection. Before spacer administration, the corresponding values were 9.8 +/- 5.4\% (P=.012)/24.8 +/- 7.8\% (P=.012), 10.1 +/- 3.0\% (P=.002)/17.9 +/- 3.9\% (P=.003), and 9.7 +/- 2.6\% (P=.003)/14.7\% +/- 2.7\% (P=.003). Importantly, spacer injection usually improved the PTV coverage for IMRT. With this technique, mean V(70.2 Gy) (P=.07) and V(74.1 Gy) (P=0.03) were 100 +/- 0\% to 99.8 +/- 0.2\% and 99.1 +/- 1.2\% to 95.8 +/- 4.6\% with and without Spacer, respectively. As a result of spacer injection, bladder doses were usually higher but not significantly so. Only IMPT managed to decrease the rectal dose after spacer injection for all dose levels, generally with no observed increase to the bladder dose. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the radiation technique, a substantial decrease of rectal dose was observed after spacer injection for curative RT to the prostate",

abstract="Image-guided IMRT is a revolutionary concept whose clinical implementation is rapidly evolving. Methods of executing beam intensity modulation have included individually designed compensators, static multi-leaf collimators (MLC), dynamic MLC, and sequential (serial) tomotherapy. We have developed helical tomotherapy as an innovative solution to overcome some of the limitations of other IMRT systems. The unique physical design of helical tomotherapy allows the realization of the concepts of adaptive radiotherapy and conformal avoidance. In principle, these advances should improve normal tissue sparing and permit dose reconstruction and verification, thereby allowing significant biologically effective dose escalation. Recent radiobiological findings can be translated into altered fractionation schemes that aim to improve the local control and long-term survival. This strategy is being tested at the University of Wisconsin using helical tomotherapy with its highly precise delivery and verification system along with meticulous and practical forms of immobilization. Innovative techniques such optical guidance, respiratory gating, and ultrasound assessments are being designed and tailored for helical tomotherapy use. The intrinsic capability of helical tomotherapy for megavoltage CT (MVCT) imaging for IMRT image-guidance is being optimized. The unique features of helical tomotherapy might allow implementation of image-guided IMRT that was previously impossible or impractical. Here we review the technological, physical, and radiobiological rationale for the ongoing and upcoming clinical trials that will use image-guided IMRT in the form of helical tomotherapy; and we describe our plans for testing our hypotheses in a rigorous prospective fashion",

abstract="The basis for the range calculation of heavy ions in tissue is an empirical correlation between x-ray CT numbers and ion ranges measured for tissue equivalent materials. Iodine contrast agents (CA), used during computed tomography (CT) imaging, lead to an increase of the Hounsfield units in tissue with increased CA uptake and cause errors in the calculation of the ranges. The aim of this work is to quantify how accurately ion range is calculated in CA loaded tissue. In order to quantify the mean change in Hounsfield units (HU), a statistical analysis of 25 CT data sets with and without CA was performed. To establish a relation between the change in Hounsfield units due to CA and changes in ion range, the Hounsfield number for various CA concentrations and the range of ions in CA was measured. The analysis of CT data sets showed that after intravenous injection of 100 ml contrast agent (Imeron300) at a concentration of 300 mg iodine/ml an increase of the Hounsfield numbers in tumor tissue of up to 57 HU can be observed. The measured range shift in CA is much smaller than calculated by the treatment planning system (TPS). The maximum error in range resulting from the CA enhanced data is approximately 2.5\% and results mainly from this wrong interpretation of HU by the TPS. For a tumor with an extent of 5 cm this leads to an exaggeration of the ion ranges during irradiation of (1.24+/-0.04) mm. This may be clinically relevant in cases where highest precision is needed and where organs at risk are close to the target volume. In view of these findings it may be safer to rely solely on native CT data for the purpose of dose and range optimization in therapy planning for heavy ions and protons",

abstract="PURPOSE: The LET position of the RBE maximum and its dependence on the cellular repair capacity was determined for carbon ions. Hamster cell lines of differing repair capacity were irradiated with monoenergetic carbon ions. RBE values for cell inactivation at different survival levels were determined and the differences in the RBE-LET patterns were compared with the individual sensitivity to photon irradiation of the different cell lines. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three hamster cell lines, the wild-type cell lines V79 and CHO-K1 and the radiosensitive CHO mutant xrs5, were irradiated with carbon ions of different energies (2.4-266.4 MeV/u) and LET values (13.7-482.7 keV/microm) and inactivation data were measured in comparison to 250 kV x-rays. RESULTS: For the repair-proficient cell lines a RBE maximum was found at LET values between 150 and 200 keV/microm. For the repair-deficient cell line the RBE failed to show a maximum and decreased continuously for LET values above 100 keV/microm. CONCLUSIONS: The carbon RBE LET relationship for inactivation is shifted to higher LET values compared with protons and alpha-particles. RBE correlated with the repair capacity of the cells",

Besides the physical selectivity that makes ions especially efficient for deep-seated tumours and tumours close to critical organs, carbon ions with their enhanced relative biological effectiveness offer an additional biological advantage for slow-growing radioresistant tumours, with an additional gain for tumours with hypoxic sections. These advantages can only be fully exploited by active beam-shaping and biology-based treatment planning",

In contrast to neutrons where RBE is widely independent from penetration depth, high energy carbon beams have a low RBE at the entrance and a high RBE in the target-volume. Therefore, the side effects to normal tissue are small, while the tumor response can be maximized. In the paper, experimental RBE values for inactivation are compiled, that demonstrate the RBE dependence from the repair capacity. In a theoretical approach, the local effect model (LEM), this dependence is used to calculate clinical RBE. Examples for clinical RBEs are given that have been applied to patient treatments",

abstract="Although hypoxia has been known for decades to play an important role in the outcome of radiotherapy in oncology, and inspite of the contribution of hypoxia to a myriad of pathologies that involve vascular disease, the selective imaging of hypoxic tissue has attained prominence only within the past decade. Contemporary research in the hypoxia imaging field is based largely on radiosensitizer research of the 1960's and 1970's. Early sensitizer research identified a family of nitro-organic compounds, the N-1 substituted 2-nitroimidazoles as candidate drugs. The early champion, and still the reference standard for therapeutic radiosensitization of hypoxic tumor cells is misonidazole (MISO). Its peripheral neurotoxicity led to failure in clinical studies, but its biological, biophysical and biochemical properties have been investigated in detail and serve as a basis for further design, not only of sensitizers, but of diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals for imaging tissue hypoxia. Pharmacokinetic characterization of radiopharmaceuticals, specifically radiopharmaceuticals for imaging tissue hypoxia, has not been a central theme in their development. The advent of PET, through which quantitative determinations first became possible, opened the field for both descriptive and analytical radiopharmacokinetic studies. In SPECT, however, this approach is still undergoing refinement. This paper addresses some of the underlying issues in radiopharmaceutical pharmacokinetics. There is a paucity of published radiopharmacokinetic data for SPECT hypoxia imaging agents. Consequently, the pharmacokinetic issues for MISO are presented as a basis for development of pharmacokinetics for the chemically-related imaging agents. Properties of an hypoxia marker are described from a pharmacokinetic viewpoint, a theoretical model for descriptive pharmacokinetics is introduced and finally, recent pharmacokinetic studies from our laboratory are described",

abstract="In the presence of intrafraction organ motion, target localization uncertainty can greatly hamper the advantage of highly conformal dose techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). To minimize the adverse dosimetric effect caused by tumor motion, a real-time knowledge of the tumor position is required throughout the beam delivery process. The recent integration of onboard kV diagnostic imaging together with MV electronic portal imaging devices on linear accelerators can allow for real-time three-dimensional (3D) tumor position monitoring during a treatment delivery. The aim of this study is to demonstrate a near real-time 3D internal fiducial tracking system based on the combined use of kV and MV imaging. A commercially available radiotherapy system equipped with both kV and MV imaging systems was used in this work. A hardware video frame grabber was used to capture both kV and MV video streams simultaneously through independent video channels at 30 frames per second. The fiducial locations were extracted from the kV and MV images using a software tool. The geometric tracking capabilities of the system were evaluated using a pelvic phantom with embedded fiducials placed on a moveable stage. The maximum tracking speed of the kV/MV system is approximately 9 Hz, which is primarily limited by the frame rate of the MV imager. The geometric accuracy of the system is found to be on the order of less than 1 mm in all three spatial dimensions. The technique requires minimal hardware modification and is potentially useful for image-guided radiation therapy systems",

abstract="Today, inverse treatment planning for intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) usually employs a constant relative biological effectiveness (RBE). In this paper, the potential clinical relevance of RBE variations for scanning techniques in IMPT is investigated, and a new strategy to include the RBE into the inverse planning process is presented. Three-dimensional RBE distributions are calculated based on a phenomenological model that describes the RBE as a function of dose, linear energy transfer (LET) and tissue type in the framework of the linear-quadratic model. This RBE model is integrated into the optimization loop of inverse planning by using a modified version of the standard quadratic objective function, where the physical dose is replaced by the biological effect. This system for ``biological optimization'' was implemented into a research version of the inverse planning software KonRad and allows the direct optimization of the product of RBE and physical dose. Several treatment plans for a prostate case are presented, which compare the biological with the conventional physical dose optimization for IMPT scanning techniques, in particular distal edge tracking (DET) and the full three-dimensional (3D) modulation of beam spots. Mainly due to their different LET distributions, the RBE effects for these two techniques are quite different: while the RBE distribution was more or less homogeneous in the planning target volume (PTV) for 3D modulation, considerable RBE variations within the PTV were observed for DET. These unfavorable effects could be compensated for by employing the new biological objective function, which led to a more homogeneous distribution of the product of RBE and physical dose in the PTV. The computation time increased by a factor of 2 compared to the optimization of the physical dose. In conclusion, the proposed method allows the simultaneous multifield optimization of the biological effect in a reasonable time, and is therefore well suited for studying the influence of a variable RBE in IMPT as well as for minimizing potentially adverse effects",

abstract="Review of the role of chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer with a specific focus on the technical feasibility and the integration of chemoradiotherapy into multimodal treatment concepts. Combined chemoradiotherapy of pancreatic cancer is a safe treatment with an acceptable profile of side effects when applied with modern planning and radiation techniques as well as considering tissue tolerance. Conventionally fractionated radiation regimens with total doses of 45-50 Gy and small-volume boost radiation with 5.4 Gy have found the greatest acceptance. Locoregional lymphatic drainage should be included in the planning of target volumes because the risk of tumor involvement and local or loco-regional recurrence is high. Up to now, 5-fluorouracil has been considered the ``standard'' agent for concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The role of gemcitabine given concurrently with radiation has not yet been defined, since high local efficacy may also be accompanied by enhanced toxicities. In addition, no dose or administration form has been determined to be ``standard'' up to now. The focus of presently ongoing research is to define an effective and feasible regimen of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. While preliminary results indicate promising results using gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy, reliable data derived from mature phase III trials are greatly needed. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy has been developed to improve target-specific radiation and to reduce organ toxicity. Its clinical relevance still needs to be defined",

abstract="PURPOSE: To report on the initial clinical use of a commercially available system to deliver gated treatment using implanted fiducials, in-room kV X-rays, and an infrared camera tracking system. METHODS AND MATERIALS: ExacTrac Adaptive Gating from BrainLab is a localization system using infrared cameras and X-rays. Gating signals are the patient's breathing pattern obtained from infrared reflectors on the patient. kV X-rays of an implanted fiducial are synchronized to the breathing pattern. After localization and shift of the patient to isocenter, the breathing pattern is used to gate the radiation. Feasibility tests included localization accuracy, radiation output constancy, and dose distributions with gating. Clinical experience is reported on treatment of patients with small lung lesions. RESULTS: Localization accuracy of a moving target with gating was 1.7 mm. Dose constancy measurements showed insignificant change in output with gating. Improvements of dose distributions on moving targets improved with gating. Eleven patients with lung lesions were implanted with 20 mmx0.7 mm gold coil (Visicoil). The implanted fiducial was used to localize and treat the patients with gating. Treatment planning and repeat computed tomographic scans showed that the change in center of gross target volume (GTV) to implanted marker averaged 2.47 mm due in part to asymmetric tumor shrinkage. CONCLUSION: ExacTrac Adaptive Gating has been used to treat lung lesions. Initial system evaluation verified its accuracy and usability. Implanted fiducials are visible in X-rays and did not migrate",

This study involves the first human use of the system, to evaluate the localization accuracy of this technique compared with radiographic localization and to assess its ability to obtain real-time prostate-motion information. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Three transponders were implanted in each of 20 patients. Eleven eligible patients of the 20 patients participated in a study arm that compared radiographic triangulated transponder locations to electromagnetically recorded transponder locations. Transponders were tracked for 8-min periods. RESULTS: The implantations were all successful, with no major complications. Intertransponder distances were largely stable. Comparison of the patient localization on the basis of transponder locations as per the Calypso system with the radiographic transponder localization showed an average (+/-SD) 3D difference of 1.5 +/- 0.9 mm. Upon tracking during 8 min, 2 of the 11 patients showed significant organ motion (>1 cm), with some motion lasting longer that 1 min. CONCLUSION: Calypso transponders can be used as magnetic intraprostatic fiducials. Clinical evaluation of this novel 4D nonionizing electromagnetic localization system with transponders indicates a comparable localization accuracy to isocenter, (within 2 mm) compared with X-ray localization",

abstract="PURPOSE: lower lobe lung tumors move with amplitudes of up to 2 cm due to respiration. To reduce respiration imaging artifacts in planning CT scans, 4D imaging techniques are used. Currently, we use a single (midventilation) frame of the 4D data set for clinical delineation of structures and radiotherapy planning. A single frame, however, often contains artifacts due to breathing irregularities, and is noisier than a conventional CT scan since the exposure per frame is lower. Moreover, the tumor may be displaced from the mean tumor position due to hysteresis. The aim of this work is to develop a framework for the acquisition of a good quality scan representing all scanned anatomy in the mean position by averaging transformed (deformed) CT frames, i.e., canceling out motion. A nonrigid registration method is necessary since motion varies over the lung. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 4D and inspiration breath-hold (BH) CT scans were acquired for 13 patients. An iterative multiscale motion estimation technique was applied to the 4D CT scan, similar to optical flow but using image phase (gray-value transitions from bright to dark and vice versa) instead. From the (4D) deformation vector field (DVF) derived, the local mean position in the respiratory cycle was computed and the 4D DVF was modified to deform all structures of the original 4D CT scan to this mean position. A 3D midposition (MidP) CT scan was then obtained by (arithmetic or median) averaging of the deformed 4D CT scan. Image registration accuracy, tumor shape deviation with respect to the BH CT scan, and noise were determined to evaluate the image fidelity of the MidP CT scan and the performance of the technique. RESULTS: Accuracy of the used deformable image registration method was comparable to established automated locally rigid registration and to manual landmark registration (average difference to both methods < 0.5 mm for all directions) for the tumor region. From visual assessment, the registration was good for the clearly visible features (e.g., tumor and diaphragm). The shape of the tumor, with respect to that of the BH CT scan, was better represented by the MidP reconstructions than any of the 4D CT frames (including MidV; reduction of ``shape differences'' was 66\%). The MidP scans contained about one-third the noise of individual 4D CT scan frames. CONCLUSIONS: We implemented an accurate method to estimate the motion of structures in a 4D CT scan. Subsequently, a novel method to create a midposition CT scan (time-weighted average of the anatomy) for treatment planning with reduced noise and artifacts was introduced. Tumor shape and position in the MidP CT scan represents that of the BH CT scan better than MidV CT scan and, therefore, was found to be appropriate for treatment planning",

abstract="PURPOSE: To discuss planning target volumes (PTVs) based on internal target volume (PTVITV), exhale-gated radiotherapy (PTVGating), and a new proposed midposition (PTVMidP; time-weighted mean tumor position) and compare them with the conventional free-breathing CT scan PTV (PTVConv). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Respiratory motion induces systematic and random geometric uncertainties. Their contribution to the clinical target volume (CTV)-to-PTV margins differs for each PTV approach. The uncertainty margins were calculated using a dose-probability-based margin recipe (based on patient statistics). Tumor motion in four-dimensional CT scans was determined using a local rigid registration of the tumor. Geometric uncertainties for interfractional setup errors and tumor baseline variation were included. For PTVGating, the residual motion within a 30\% gating (time) window was determined. The concepts were evaluated in terms of required CTV-to-PTV margin and PTV volume for 45 patients. RESULTS: Over the patient group, the PTVITV was on average larger (+6\%) and the PTVGating and PTVMidP smaller (-10\%) than the PTVConv using an off-line (bony anatomy) setup correction protocol. With an on-line (soft tissue) protocol the differences in PTV compared with PTVConv were +33\%, -4\%, and 0, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The internal target volume method resulted in a significantly larger PTV than conventional CT scanning. The exhale-gated and mid-position approaches were comparable in terms of PTV. However, mid-position (or mid-ventilation) is easier to use in the clinic because it only affects the planning part of treatment and not the delivery",

abstract="Objective: Strategic myocardial ablation with multiple invasive catheters is an increasingly common treatment for cardiac arrhythmias. The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility of noninvasive myocardial ablation by stereotactic radiosurgery. Methods: Three healthy Hanford pigs were treated on a G-4 CyberKnife radiosurgical system with Xsight image guidance. Targets in the atria (left atrial appendage, left superior and inferior pulmonary veins, and cavotricuspid isthmus) were contoured and optimal treatment plans were defined on the MultiPlan System (versions 1.4 and 1.5.1). All treatments were administered in single isocentric fractions (25Gy and 40Gy). Animals were sacrificed at 16, 33, and 89 days after treatment for histologic examination of the heart and contiguous organs (esophagus, trachea, aorta, and lungs). Prior to sacrifice, EKGs, inter-atrial electophysiologic recordings, and 3-D electroanatomic mappings (CARTO) were performed. Results: All animals survived treatment without adverse effects. No secondary arrhythmias, valve, or ventricular abnormalities were observed. The treated areas showed focal fibrosis and reduced conduction voltage potentials. In the case of the third animal (treated with 40Gy and studied at 89 days), there was significant voltage attenuation observed in both inter-atrial electrophysiologic recordings and CARTO mapping of the targeted cavotricuspid isthmus. Conclusions: Radiosurgery with CyberKnife can be used to target and ablate discrete areas of the myocardium, without detrimental effects. Further study into the application of radiosurgery for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias is warranted.",

abstract="Multiple studies have indicated that the prostate is not stationary and can move as much as 2 cm. Such prostate movements are problematic for intensity-modulated radiotherapy, with its associated tight margins and dose escalation. Because of these intrinsic daily uncertainties, a relative generous ``margin'' is necessary to avoid marginal misses. Using the CT-linear accelerator combination in the treatment suite (Primatom, Siemens), we found that the daily intrinsic prostate movements can be easily corrected before each radiotherapy session. Dosimetric calculations were performed to evaluate the amount of discrepancy of dose to the target if no correction was done for prostate movement.Methods and materialsThe Primatom consists of a Siemens Somatom CT scanner and a Siemens Primus linear accelerator installed in the same treatment suite and sharing a common table/couch. The patient is scanned by the CT scanner, which is movable on a pair of horizontal rails. During scanning, the couch does not move. The exact location of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and rectum are identified and localized. These positions are then compared with the planned positions. The daily movement of the prostate and rectum were corrected for and a new isocenter derived. The patient was treated immediately using the new isocenter.ResultsOf the 108 patients with primary prostate cancer studied, 540 consecutive daily CT scans were performed during the last part of the cone down treatment. Of the 540 scans, 46\% required no isocenter adjustments for the AP-PA direction, 54\% required a shift of [greater-than-or-equal]3 mm, 44\% required a shift of >5 mm, and 15\% required a shift of >10 mm. In the superoinferior direction, 27\% required a shift of >3 mm, 25\% required a shift of >5 mm, and 4\% required a shift of >10 mm. In the right-left direction, 34\% required a shift of >3 mm, 24\% required a shift of >5 mm, and 5\% required a shift of >10 mm. Dosimetric calculations for a typical case of prostate cancer using intensity-modulated radiotherapy with 5-mm margin coverage from the clinical target volume (prostate gland) was performed. With a posterior shift of 10 mm for the prostate, the dose coverage dropped from 95-107\% to 71-100\% coverage.ConclusionWe have described a technique that corrects for the daily prostate motion, allowing for extremely precise prostate cancer treatment. This technique has significant implications for dose escalation and for decreasing rectal complications in the treatment of prostate cancer",

abstract="PURPOSE: To review 1870 CT scans of interfractional prostate shift obtained during image-guided radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 1870 pretreatment CT scans were acquired with CT-on-rails, and the corresponding shift data for 329 patients with prostate cancer were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 1870 scans reviewed, 44\% required no setup adjustments in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction, 14\% had shifts of 3-5 mm, 29\% had shifts of 6-10 mm, and 13\% had shifts of >10 mm. In the superior-inferior direction, 81\% had no adjustments, 2\% had shifts of 3-5 mm, 15\% had shifts of 6-10 mm, and 2\% had shifts of >10 mm. In the left-right direction, 65\% had no adjustment, 13\% had shifts of 3-5 mm, 17\% had shifts of 6-10 mm, and 5\% had shifts of >10 mm. Further analysis of the first 66 consecutive patients divided into three groups according to body mass index indicates that the shift in the AP direction for the overweight subgroup was statistically larger than those for the control and obese subgroups (p < 0.05). The interfractional shift in the lateral direction for the obese group (1 SD, 5.5 mm) was significantly larger than those for the overweight and control groups (4.1 and 2.9 mm, respectively) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that there is a significantly greater shift in the AP direction than in the lateral and superior-inferior directions for the entire patient group. Overweight and obese patient groups show a significant difference from the control group in terms of prostate shift",

title="The use of active breathing control (ABC) to reduce margin for breathing motion",
journal="International Journal of Radiation Oncology*Biology*Physics",

volume="44",

pages="911--919",
abstract="Purpose: For tumors in the thorax and abdomen, reducing the treatment margin for organ motion due to breathing reduces the volume of normal tissues that will be irradiated. A higher dose can be delivered to the target, provided that the risk of marginal misses is not increased. To ensure safe margin reduction, we investigated the feasibility of using active breathing control (ABC) to temporarily immobilize the patient?s breathing. Treatment planning and delivery can then be performed at identical ABC conditions with minimal margin for breathing motion.Methods and Materials: An ABC apparatus is constructed consisting of 2 pairs of flow monitor and scissor valve, 1 each to control the inspiration and expiration paths to the patient. The patient breathes through a mouth-piece connected to the ABC apparatus. The respiratory signal is processed continuously, using a personal computer that displays the changing lung volume in real-time. After the patient?s breathing pattern becomes stable, the operator activates ABC at a preselected phase in the breathing cycle. Both valves are then closed to immobilize breathing motion. Breathing motion of 12 patients were held with ABC to examine their acceptance of the procedure. The feasibility of applying ABC for treatment was tested in 5 patients by acquiring volumetric scans with a spiral computed tomography (CT) scanner during active breath-hold. Two patients had Hodgkin?s disease, 2 had metastatic liver cancer, and 1 had lung cancer. Two intrafraction ABC scans were acquired at the same respiratory phase near the end of normal or deep inspiration. An additional ABC scan near the end of normal expiration was acquired for 2 patients. The ABC scans were also repeated 1 week later for a Hodgkin?s patient. In 1 liver patient, ABC scans were acquired at 7 different phases of the breathing cycle to facilitate examination of the liver motion associated with ventilation. Contours of the lungs and livers were outlined when applicable. The variation of the organ positions and volumes for the different scans were quantified and compared.Results: The ABC procedure was well tolerated in the 12 patients. When ABC was applied near the end of normal expiration, the minimal duration of active breath-hold was 15 s for 1 patient with lung cancer, and 20 s or more for all other patients. The duration was greater than 40 s for 2 patients with Hodgkin?s disease when ABC was applied during deep inspiration. Scan artifacts associated with normal breathing motion were not observed in the ABC scans. The analysis of the small set of intrafraction scan data indicated that with ABC, the liver volumes were reproducible at about 1\%, and lung volumes to within 6\%. The excursions of a ``center of target'' parameter for the livers were less than 1 mm at the same respiratory phase, but were larger than 4 mm at the extremes of the breathing cycle. The inter-fraction scan study indicated that daily setup variation contributed to the uncertainty in assessing the reproducibility of organ immobilization with ABC between treatment fractions.Conclusion: The results were encouraging; ABC provides a simple means to minimize breathing motion. When applied for CT scanning and treatment, the ABC procedure requires no more than standard operation of the CT scanner or the medical accelerator. The ABC scans are void of motion artifacts commonly seen on fast spiral CT scans. When acquired at different points in the breathing cycle, these ABC scans show organ motion in three-dimension (3D) that can be used to enhance treatment planning. Reproducibility of organ immobilization with ABC throughout the course of treatment must be quantified before the procedure can be applied to reduce margin for conformal treatment",

abstract="In routine clinical practice, radiotherapy treatment planning is performed based on the patient CT images obtained during the patient setup procedure. However, the actual delivered dose to the patient might be different from the planned dose because of various reasons such as patient motion. Under such situations, it is desirable to modify the original treatment plan in order to partially remedy the dose delivery errors in the subsequent dose delivery process. Such modification can be implemented by modifying the original treatment plan using re-optimization. In this work, issues such as the re-optimization dose prescription, optimization constraints in re-optimization, re-optimization in multiple fractionation schemes and re-optimization procedure with generalized dose-based objective functions were investigated and corresponding mathematical schemes proposed. The derived results were applied to a clinical case study in which it was shown that the proposed re-optimization method is able to remedy the cold spots in tumour while delivering low dose to normal structures. Thus the potential effectiveness of the method was demonstrated",

abstract="In image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), volumetric information on patient anatomy at treatment conditions is made available with in-room imaging devices capable of cone-beam CT. Setup error and inter-fraction rigid motion can be corrected online. The planning margin can therefore be reduced significantly. However, to compensate for uncertainties including organ deformation and intra-fraction motion, offline evaluation and replanning are necessary. The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of an offline dose compensation technique to further reduce the margin safely. In IGRT, online CT scan, rigid image registration and setup correction are performed at each fraction. Later the regions of interest are registered offline between treatment and planning CTs using a finite element method to account for non-rigid organ motion. Cumulative dose distribution is calculated and compared with the prescription dose. The discrepancy, if found significant, is repaired using the dose compensation technique, in which the cumulative dose distribution is incorporated in adaptive IMRT planning for future fractions. Two compensation schedules were tested in this study: single compensation at the end of the treatment course and compensation performed weekly. One patient with one planning CT and 16 treatment CTs were used in this simulation study. Due to the aggressive smaller planning margin used, severe underdose was observed in the clinical target volume. The size and magnitude of the underdose were reduced substantially with online guidance but were still significant. Both dose compensation strategies were able to reduce the dose deficit to an acceptable level without additional planning margin. Weekly compensation is more biologically beneficial and can spread the execution error into multiple fractions. The offline dose compensation technique allows further margin reduction and can complement the online guidance by compensating for uncertainties that cannot be reduced online, thereby increasing the confidence in IGRT delivery",

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate an online image-guidance strategy for conformal treatment of prostate cancer and to estimate margin-reduction benefits. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-eight patients with at least 16 helical computed tomography scans were each used in this study. Two prostate soft-tissue registration methods, including sagittal rotation, were evaluated. Setup errors and rigid organ motion were corrected online; non-rigid and intrafraction motion were included in offline analysis. Various clinical target volume-planning target volume (CTV-PTV) margins were applied. Geometrical evaluations included analyses of isocenter shifts and rotations and overlap index. Dosimetric evaluations included minimum dose and equivalent uniform dose (EUD) for prostate and gEUD for rectum. RESULTS: Average isocenter shift and rotation were (dX,dY,dZ,theta) = (0.0 +/- 0.7,-1.1 +/- 4.0,-0.1 +/- 2.5,0.7 degrees +/- 2.0 degrees ) mm. Prostate motion in anterior-posterior (AP) direction was significantly higher than superior-inferior and left-right (LR) directions. This observation was confirmed by isocenter shift in perspectives AP (1.8 +/- 1.8 mm) and RL (3.7 +/- 3.0 mm). Organ motion degrades target coverage and reduces doses to rectum. If 2\% dose reduction on prostate D(99) is allowed for 90\% patients, then minimum 3 mm margins are necessary with ideal image registration. CONCLUSIONS: Significant margin reduction can be achieved through online image guidance. Certain margins are still required for nonrigid and intrafraction motion. To further reduce margin, a strategy that combines online geometric intervention and offline dose replanning is necessary",

abstract="For intermediate and high risk prostate cancer, both the prostate gland and seminal vesicles are included in the clinical target volume. Internal motion patterns of these two organs vary, presenting a challenge for adaptive treatment. Adaptive techniques such as isocenter repositioning and soft tissue alignment are effective when tumor volumes only exhibit translational shift, while direct re-optimization of the intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plan maybe more desirable when extreme deformation or differential positioning changes of the organs occur. Currently, direct re-optimization of the IMRT plan using beamlet (or fluence map) has not been reported. In this study, we report a novel on-line re-optimization technique that can accomplish plan adjustment on-line. Deformable image registration is used to provide position variation information on each voxel along the three dimensions. The original planned dose distribution is used as the 'goal' dose distribution for adaptation and to ensure planning quality.

abstract="Deformable registration is needed for a variety of tasks in establishing the voxel correspondence between respiratory phases. Most registration algorithms assume or imply that the deformation field is smooth and continuous everywhere. However, the lungs are contained within closed invaginated sacs called pleurae and are allowed to slide almost independently along the chest wall. This sliding motion is characterized by a discontinuous vector field, which cannot be generated using standard deformable registration methods. The authors have developed a registration method that can create discontinuous vector fields at the boundaries of anatomical subregions. Registration is performed independently on each subregion, with a boundary-matching penalty used to prevent gaps. This method was implemented and tested using both the B-spline and Demons registration algorithms in the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit. The authors have validated this method on four patient 4DCT data sets for registration of the end-inhalation and end-exhalation volumes. Multiple experts identified homologous points in the lungs and along the ribs in the two respiratory phases. Statistical analyses of the mismatch of the homologous points before and after registration demonstrated improved overall accuracy for both algorithms",

abstract="PURPOSE: To report the characteristics of prostate motion as tracked by the stereoscopic X-ray images of the implanted fiducials during hypofractionated radiotherapy with CyberKnife. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one patients with prostate cancer who were treated with CyberKnife between January 2005 and September 2007 were selected for this retrospective study. The CyberKnife uses a stereoscopic X-ray system to obtain the position of the prostate target through the monitoring of implanted gold fiducial markers. If there is a significant deviation, the treatment is paused while the patient is repositioned by moving the couch. The deviations calculated from X-ray images acquired within the time interval between two consecutive couch motions constitute a data set. RESULTS: Included in the analysis were 427 data sets and 4,439 time stamps of X-ray images. The mean duration for each data set was 697 sec. At 30 sec, a motion >2 mm exists in about 5\% of data sets. The percentage is increased to 8\%, 11\%, and 14\% at 60 sec, 90 sec, and 120 sec, respectively. A similar trend exists for other values of prostate motion. CONCLUSIONS: With proper monitoring and intervention during treatment, the prostate shifts observed among patients can be kept within the tracking range of the CyberKnife. On average, a sampling rate of approximately 40 sec between consecutive X-rays is acceptable to ensure submillimeter tracking. However, there is significant movement variation among patients, and a higher sampling rate may be necessary in some patients",

abstract="Purpose: A feature based deformable registration model with sliding transformation was developed in the upper abdominal region for liver cancer.Methods: A two-step thin-plate spline (bi-TPS) algorithm was implemented to deformably register the liver organ. The first TPS registration was performed to exclusively quantify the sliding displacement component. A manual segmentation of the thoracic and abdominal cavity was performed as a priori knowledge. Tissue feature points were automatically identified inside the segmented contour on the images. The scale invariant feature transform method was utilized to match feature points that served as landmarks for the subsequent TPS registration to derive the sliding displacement vector field. To a good approximation, only motion along superior/inferior (SI) direction of voxels on each slice was averaged to obtain the sliding displacement for each slice. A second TPS transformation, as the last step, was carried out to obtain the local deformation field. Manual identification of bifurcation on liver, together with the manual segmentation of liver organ, was employed as a ``ground truth'' for assessing the algorithm's performance.Results: The proposed two-step TPS was assessed with six liver patients. The average error of liver bifurcation between manual identification and calculation for these patients was less than 1.8 mm. The residual errors between manual contour and propagated contour of liver organ using the algorithm fell in the range between 2.1 and 2.8 mm. An index of Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) between manual contour and calculated contour for liver tumor was 93.6\% compared with 71.2\% from the conventional TPS calculation.Conclusions: A high accuracy ( approximately 2 mm) of the two-step feature based TPS registration algorithm was achievable for registering the liver organ. The discontinuous motion in the upper abdominal region was properly taken into consideration. Clinical implementation of the algorithm will find broad application in radiation therapy of liver cancer",

abstract="The purpose of this study was to make a pathological evaluation of the tumor response and the lung injury of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients after carbon ion therapy. We enrolled four NSCLC patients with chest wall invasion but without nodal and distant metastasis (T3N0M0). Only primary lesions were irradiated with carbon ions, followed by surgical resection. The patients consisted of three males and one female varying by age from 54 to 73 (average 66.3). Total treatment dose was 59.4 and 64.8 GyE, respectively, administered in 18 fractions over 6 weeks, or 72.0 GyE in 16 fractions over 4 weeks. Resection after radiation therapy was performed as a combination of lobectomy, lymph node dissection and chest wall surgery. After fixation, the lung was sliced into thin sections to match the CT image. Each slice was anatomically identified and the slices were compared with each other subjected to pathological analysis. No tumor cells were observed in two cases. The other two cases exhibited only a few tumor cells sparsely distributed in the lung tissue. There was evidence of dense pulmonary fibrosis in the limited space surrounding primary tumors, but its density was found to rapidly decrease in the narrow area toward the outside. The rate at which its density subsided mirrored the rapid decrease in the planning CT dose distribution. Microscopy showed no evidence of fibrosis in any of the fields irradiated with less than 15 GyE. Microscopy confirmed an outstanding tumor response with limited pulmonary fibrosis. This substantiates the superior dose localization and strong biological effect of carbon ion beams with a Bragg peak in the lung. The pathological findings have thus provided evidence of the safety and effectiveness of carbon beam therapy in the treatment of NSCLC",

abstract="PURPOSE: To quantify the type, frequency, and magnitude of artifacts in four-dimensional (4D) CT images acquired using a multislice cine method. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty consecutive patients who underwent 4D-CT scanning and radiotherapy for thoracic or abdominal cancers were included in this study. All the 4D-CT scans were performed on the GE multislice PET/CT scanner with the Varian Real-time Position Management system in cine mode. The GE Advantage 4D software was used to create 4D-CT data sets. The artifacts were then visually and quantitatively analyzed. We performed statistical analyses to evaluate the relationships between patient- or breathing-pattern-related parameters and the occurrence as well as magnitude of artifacts. RESULTS: It was found that 45 of 50 patients (90\%) had at least one artifact (other than blurring) with a mean magnitude of 11.6 mm (range, 4.4-56.0 mm) in the diaphragm or heart. We also observed at least one artifact in 6 of 20 lung or mediastinal tumors (30\%). Statistical analysis revealed that there were significant differences between several breathing-pattern-related parameters, including abdominal displacement (p < 0.01), for the subgroups of patients with and without artifacts. The magnitude of an artifact was found to be significantly but weakly correlated with the abdominal displacement difference between two adjacent couch positions (R = 0.34, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified that the frequency and magnitude of artifacts in 4D-CT is alarmingly high. Significant improvement is needed in 4D-CT imaging",

abstract="The long patient port of a PET scanner tends to put stress on patients, especially patients with claustrophobia. It also prevents doctors and technicians from taking care of patients during scanning. In this paper, we proposed an 'open PET' geometry, which consists of two axially separated detector rings. A long and continuous field-of-view (FOV) including a 360 degrees opened gap between two detector rings can be imaged enabling a fully 3D image reconstruction of all the possible lines-of-response. The open PET will become practical if iterative image reconstruction methods are applied even though image reconstruction of the open PET is analytically an incomplete problem. First we implemented a 'masked' 3D ordered subset expectation maximization (OS-EM) in which the system matrix was obtained from a long 'gapless' scanner by applying a mask to detectors corresponding to the open space. Next, in order to evaluate imaging performance of the proposed open PET geometry, we simulated a dual HR+ scanner (ring diameter of D = 827 mm, axial length of W = 154 mm x 2) separated by a variable gap. The gap W was the maximum limit to have axially continuous FOV of 3W though the maximum diameter of FOV at the central slice was limited to D/2. Artifacts, observed on both sides of the open space when the gap exceeded W, were effectively reduced by inserting detectors partially into unnecessary open spaces. We also tested the open PET geometry using experimental data obtained by the jPET-D4. The jPET-D4 is a prototype brain scanner, which has 5 rings of 24 detector blocks. We simulated the open jPET-D4 with a gap of 66 mm by eliminating 1 block-ring from experimental data. Although some artifacts were seen at both ends of the opened gap, very similar images were obtained with and without the gap. The proposed open PET geometry is expected to lead to realization of in-beam PET, which is a method for an in situ monitoring of charged particle therapy, by letting the beams pass through the gap. The proposed open PET geometry will also allow simultaneous PET/CT measurements of the same PET FOV as the CT FOV, in contrast to the conventional PET/CT where each FOV is separated by several tens of centimeters",

abstract="PURPOSE: Using daily setup variation measured from an electronic portal imaging device (EPID), radiation treatment of the individual patient can be adaptively reoptimized during the course of therapy. In this study, daily portal images were retrospectively examined to: (a) determine the number of initial days of portal imaging required to give adequate prediction of the systematic and random setup errors; and (b) explore the potential of using the prediction as feedback to reoptimize the individual treatment part-way through the treatment course. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Daily portal images of 64 cancer patients, whose treatment position was not adjusted during the course of treatment, were obtained from two independent clinics with similar setup procedures. Systematic and random setup errors for each patient were predicted using different numbers of initial portal measurements. The statistical confidence of the predictions was tested to determine the number of daily portal measurements needed to give reasonable predictions. Two treatment processes were simulated to examine the potential opportunity for setup margin reduction and dose escalation. The first process mimicked a conventional treatment. A constant margin was assigned to each treatment field to compensate for the average setup error of the patient population. A treatment dose was then prescribed with reference to a fixed normal tissue tolerance, and then fixed in the entire course of treatment. In the second process, the same treatment fields and prescribed dose were used only for the initial plan and treatment. After several initial days of treatments, the treatment field shape and position were assumed to be adaptively modified using a computer-controlled multileaf collimator (MLC) in light of the predicted systematic and random setup errors. The prescribed dose was then escalated until the same normal tissue tolerance, as determined in the first treatment process, was reached. RESULTS: The systematic setup error and the random setup error were predicted to be within +/-1 mm for the former and +/-0.5 mm for the latter at a > or = 95\% confidence level using < or = 9 initial daily portal measurements. In the study, a large number of patients could be treated using a smaller field margin if the adaptive modification process were used. Simulation of the adaptive modification process for prostate treatment demonstrates that additional treatment dose could be safely applied to 64\% of patients. CONCLUSION: The adaptive modification process represents a different approach for use of on-line portal images. The portal imaging information from the initial treatments is used as feedback for reoptimization of the treatment plan, rather than adjustment of the treatment setup. Results from the retrospective study show that the treatment of individual patient can be improved with the adaptive modification process",

abstract="PURPOSE: To improve the efficacy of dose delivery and dose escalation for external beam radiotherapy of prostate cancer, an off-line strategy for constructing a patient-specific planning target volume is developed in the adaptive radiotherapy process using image feedback of target location and patient setup position. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We hypothesize that a patient-specific confidence-limited planning target volume (cl-PTV), constructed using an initial sequence of daily measurements of internal target motion and patient setup error, exists and ensures that the clinical target volume (CTV) in the prostate cancer patient receives the prescribed dose within a predefined dose tolerance. A patient-specific bounding volume to correct for target location and compensate for target random motion was first constructed using the convex hull of the first k days of CT measurements. The bounding volume and the initial days of CT measurements were minimized based on a predefined dosimetric criterion. The hypothesis was tested using multiple daily CT images by mimicking the actual treatment of both conventional 4-field-box and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) on each of 30 patients with prostate cancer. For each patient, a patient-specific setup margin was also applied to the bounding volume to form the final cl-PTV. This margin was determined using the random setup error predicted from the initial days of portal imaging measurements and the residuals after correcting for the systematic setup error. RESULTS: The bounding volume constructed using daily CT measurements in the first week of treatment are adequate for the conventional beam delivery to achieve maximum dose reduction in the CTV of 2\% or less of the prescription dose, for at least 80\% of patients (p = 0.08), and 4.5\% or less for 95\% of patients (p = 0.1). However, for IMRT delivery, 2 weeks of daily CT measurements are required to achieve a similar level of the dosimetric criterion, otherwise the maximum dose reduction of 7\%, on average, in the CTV is expected. Furthermore, the patient-specific setup margin required for the IMRT treatment is at least twice larger than that for the conventional treatment, to maintain the same dosimetric criterion. As compared to the conventional PTV, the volume of cl-PTV is significantly reduced, while maintaining the same dosimetric criterion. CONCLUSION: The cl-PTV for prostate treatment can be constructed within the first week of treatment using the feedback of imaging measurements. The cl-PTV has the capability to exclude the systematic variation and compensate for the patient-specific random variation on target location and patient setup position. This implies that in the current off-line image feedback adaptive treatment process, a single plan modification can be performed within the second week of treatment to improve the efficacy of dose delivery and dose escalation for external beam therapy of prostate cancer",

abstract="Interfractional patient variation occurs regularly and considerably during the radiotherapy course. Consequently, a generic but large planning target margin has to be applied when patient treatment plan design based on a single pre-treatment computed tomography scan is used to guide multifraction radiation treatment, which creates a major limiting factor for radiotherapy improvement. Planning target margins can be significantly reduced using multiple (or 4-dimensional) image feedback management in the routine treatment process. The most effective method in multiple-image feedback management of radiotherapy is the adaptive control methodology. The adaptive radiotherapy technique aims to customize each patient's treatment plan to patient-specific variation by evaluating and characterizing the systematic and random variations through image feedback and including them in adaptive planning. Adaptive radiotherapy will become a new treatment standard, in which a predesigned adaptive treatment strategy, including the schedules of imaging and replanning, will eventually replace the predesigned treatment plan in the routine clinical practice",

title="Adaptive prediction of internal target motion using external marker motion: a technical study",
journal="Physics in Medicine and Biology",
year="2006",
volume="51",
number="1",
pages="31--44",
abstract="An adaptive prediction approach was developed to infer internal target position by external marker positions. First, a prediction model (or adaptive neural network) is developed to infer target position from its former positions. For both internal target and external marker motion, two networks with the same type are created. Next, a linear model is established to correlate the prediction errors of both neural networks. Based on this, the prediction error of an internal target position can be reconstructed by the linear combination of the prediction errors of the external markers. Finally, the next position of the internal target is estimated by the network and subsequently corrected by the reconstructed prediction error. In a similar way, future positions are inferred as their previous positions are predicted and corrected. This method was examined by clinical data. The results demonstrated that an improvement (10\% on average) of correlation between predicted signal and real internal motion was achieved, in comparison with the correlation between external markers and internal target motion. Based on the clinical data (with correlation coefficient 0.75 on average) observed between external marker and internal target motions, a prediction error (23\% on average) of internal target position was achieved. The preliminary results indicated that this method is helpful to improve the predictability of internal target motion with the additional information of external marker signals. A consistent correlation between external and internal signals is important for prediction accuracy",

abstract="Four-dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT) imaging technology has been developed for radiation therapy to provide tumor and organ images at the different breathing phases. In this work, a procedure is proposed for estimating and modeling the respiratory motion field from acquired 4D-CT imaging data and predicting tissue motion at the different breathing phases. The 4D-CT image data consist of series of multislice CT volume segments acquired in cine mode. A modified optical flow deformable image registration algorithm is used to compute the image motion from the CT segments to a common full volume 3D-CT reference. This reference volume is reconstructed using the acquired 4D-CT data at the end-of-exhalation phase. The segments are optimally aligned to the reference volume according to a proposed a priori alignment procedure. The registration is applied using a multigrid approach and a feature-preserving image downsampling maxfilter to achieve better computational speed and higher registration accuracy. The registration accuracy is about 1.1 +/- 0.8 mm for the lung region according to our verification using manually selected landmarks and artificially deformed CT volumes. The estimated motion fields are fitted to two 5D (spatial 3D+tidal volume+airflow rate) motion models: forward model and inverse model. The forward model predicts tissue movements and the inverse model predicts CT density changes as a function of tidal volume and airflow rate. A leave-one-out procedure is used to validate these motion models. The estimated modeling prediction errors are about 0.3 mm for the forward model and 0.4 mm for the inverse model",

abstract="On-board CBCT images are used to generate patient geometric models to assist patient setup. The image data can also, potentially, be used for dose reconstruction in combination with the fluence maps from treatment plan. Here we evaluate the achievable accuracy in using a kV CBCT for dose calculation. Relative electron density as a function of HU was obtained for both planning CT (pCT) and CBCT using a Catphan-600 calibration phantom. The CBCT calibration stability was monitored weekly for 8 consecutive weeks. A clinical treatment planning system was employed for pCT- and CBCT-based dose calculations and subsequent comparisons. Phantom and patient studies were carried out. In the former study, both Catphan-600 and pelvic phantoms were employed to evaluate the dosimetric performance of the full-fan and half-fan scanning modes. To evaluate the dosimetric influence of motion artefacts commonly seen in CBCT images, the Catphan-600 phantom was scanned with and without cyclic motion using the pCT and CBCT scanners. The doses computed based on the four sets of CT images (pCT and CBCT with/without motion) were compared quantitatively. The patient studies included a lung case and three prostate cases. The lung case was employed to further assess the adverse effect of intra-scan organ motion. Unlike the phantom study, the pCT of a patient is generally acquired at the time of simulation and the anatomy may be different from that of CBCT acquired at the time of treatment delivery because of organ deformation. To tackle the problem, we introduced a set of modified CBCT images (mCBCT) for each patient, which possesses the geometric information of the CBCT but the electronic density distribution mapped from the pCT with the help of a BSpline deformable image registration software. In the patient study, the dose computed with the mCBCT was used as a surrogate of the 'ground truth'. We found that the CBCT electron density calibration curve differs moderately from that of pCT. No significant fluctuation was observed in the calibration over the period of 8 weeks. For the static phantom, the doses computed based on pCT and CBCT agreed to within 1\%. A notable difference in CBCT- and pCT-based dose distributions was found for the motion phantom due to the motion artefacts which appeared in the CBCT images (the maximum discrepancy was found to be approximately 3.0\% in the high dose region). The motion artefacts-induced dosimetric inaccuracy was also observed in the lung patient study. For the prostate cases, the m",

abstract="Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is characterized by delivering a high amount of dose in a short period of time. In SBRT the dose is delivered using open fields (e.g., beam's-eye-view) known as 'apertures'. Mathematical methods can be used for optimizing treatment planning for delivery of sufficient dose to the cancerous cells while keeping the dose to surrounding organs at risk (OARs) minimal. Two important elements of a treatment plan are quality and delivery time. Quality of a plan is measured based on the target coverage and dose to OARs. Delivery time heavily depends on the number of beams used in the plan as the setup times for different beam directions constitute a large portion of the delivery time. Therefore the ideal plan, in which all potential beams can be used, will be associated with a long impractical delivery time. We use the dose to OARs in the ideal plan to find the plan with the minimum number of beams which is guaranteed to be epsilon-optimal (i.e., a predetermined maximum deviation from the ideal plan is guaranteed). Since the treatment plan optimization is inherently a multi-criteria-optimization problem, the planner can navigate the ideal dose distribution Pareto surface and select a plan of desired target coverage versus OARs sparing, and then use the proposed technique to reduce the number of beams while guaranteeing epsilon-optimality. We use mixed integer programming (MIP) for optimization. To reduce the computation time for the resultant MIP, we use two heuristics: a beam elimination scheme and a family of heuristic cuts, known as 'neighbor cuts', based on the concept of 'adjacent beams'. We show the effectiveness of the proposed technique on two clinical cases, a liver and a lung case. Based on our technique we propose an algorithm for fast generation of epsilon-optimal plans",

abstract="PURPOSE: Strategies for dose accumulation in deforming anatomy are of interest in radiotherapy. Algorithms exist for the deformation of dose based on patient image sets, though these are sometimes contentious because not all such image calculations are constrained by physical laws. While tumor and organ motion has been a key area of study for a considerable amount of time, deformation is of increasing interest. In this work, we demonstrate a full 3D experimental validation of results from a range of dose deformation algorithms available in the public domain. METHODS: We recently developed the first tissue-equivalent, full 3D deformable dosimetric phantom-``DEFGEL.'' To assess the accuracy of dose-warping based on deformable image registration (DIR), we have measured doses in undeformed and deformed states of the DEFGEL dosimeter and compared these to planned doses and warped doses. In this way we have directly evaluated the accuracy of dose-warping calculations for 11 different algorithms. We have done this for a range of stereotactic irradiation schemes and types and magnitudes of deformation. RESULTS: The original Horn and Schunck algorithm is shown to be the best performing of the 11 algorithms trialled. Comparing measured and dose-warped calculations for this method, it is found that for a 10 x 10 mm(2) square field, gamma(3\%3mm) = 99.9\%; for a 20 x 20 mm(2) cross-shaped field, gamma(3\%3mm) = 99.1\%; and for a multiple dynamic arc (0.413 cm(3) PTV) treatment adapted from a patient treatment plan, gamma(3\%3mm) = 95\%. In each case, the agreement is comparable to-but consistently approximately 1\% less than-comparison between measured and calculated (planned) dose distributions in the absence of deformation. The magnitude of the deformation, as measured by the largest displacement experienced by any voxel in the volume, has the greatest influence on the accuracy of the warped dose distribution. Considering the square field case, the smallest deformation ( approximately 9 mm) yields agreement of gamma(3\%3mm) = 99.9\%, while the most significant deformation ( approximately 20 mm) yields agreement of gamma(3\%3mm) = 96.7\%. CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed that, for a range of mass and density conserving deformations representative of those observable in anatomical targets, DIR-based dose-warping can yield accurate predictions of the dose distribution. Substantial differences can be seen between the results of different algorithms indicating that DIR performance should be scrutinized before application todose-warping. We have demonstrated that the DEFGEL deformable dosimeter can be used to evaluate DIR performance and the accuracy of dose-warping results by direct measurement",

abstract="An essential component in proton radiotherapy is the algorithm to calculate the radiation dose to be delivered to the patient. The most common dose algorithms are fast but they are approximate analytical approaches. However their level of accuracy is not always satisfactory, especially for heterogeneous anatomical areas, like the thorax. Monte Carlo techniques provide superior accuracy; however, they often require large computation resources, which render them impractical for routine clinical use. Track-repeating algorithms, for example the fast dose calculator, have shown promise for achieving the accuracy of Monte Carlo simulations for proton radiotherapy dose calculations in a fraction of the computation time. We report on the implementation of the fast dose calculator for proton radiotherapy on a card equipped with graphics processor units (GPUs) rather than on a central processing unit architecture. This implementation reproduces the full Monte Carlo and CPU-based track-repeating dose calculations within 2\%, while achieving a statistical uncertainty of 2\% in less than 1 min utilizing one single GPU card, which should allow real-time accurate dose calculations",

abstract="Purpose: Extracranial radiosurgery requires control of organ motion. The purpose of this study is to quantitatively determine the extent of liver motion in anesthetized dogs with continuous i.v. propofol infusion with or without muscle relaxants and high-frequency jet ventilation.Methods and Materials: Five dogs were used in the experiment. Each dog was restrained while anesthetized in the supine position using an alpha cradle. Surgical metal clips were implanted around the liver periphery so that its motion could be visualized using a fluoroscopic imaging device in a conventional simulator. Initially, two orthogonal simulation films were taken to correlate locations of implanted clips. Two orthogonal views of fluoroscopic images for each anesthetized dog were recorded on a magnetic tape and analyzed from the post-imaging data. Liver motion was documented under the following three conditions: 1) ventilated with a conventional mechanical ventilator, 2) ventilated with a high-frequency jet ventilator, and 3) ventilated with a high-frequency jet ventilator and total muscle paralysis (with vecuronium injection). The maximum liver motion for each dog was analyzed in three orthogonal directions: the inferior-to-superior direction, the anterior-to-posterior direction, and the right-to-left direction.Results: When the anesthetized dogs were ventilated with a conventional mechanical ventilator, the average liver motions were 1.2 cm in the inferior-to-superior direction, 0.4 cm in the anterior-to-posterior direction, and 0.2 cm in the right-to-left direction, respectively. After the introduction of high-frequency jet ventilation, the average liver motions were reduced to 0.2 cm in the inferior-to-superior direction, 0.2 cm in the anterior-to-posterior direction, and 0.1 cm in the right-to-left direction. The maximum liver motion was dependent on ventilator settings. There was no additional measurable motion reduction with the addition of the muscle relaxant.Conclusion: The liver motion in each anesthetized dog was controlled under 3.0 mm in all directions with the use of high-frequency jet ventilation. No detectable advantage was identified by the injection of muscle relaxant in terms of further reducing the liver motion. The preclinical animal study indicated that the use of high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) would be able to limit the liver motion to an extent acceptable for the application of extracranial radiosurgery in humans. Radiosurgery for localized liver tumors warrants further investigation",

title="The effects of intra-fraction organ motion on the delivery of dynamic intensity modulation",
journal="Physics in Medicine and Biology",
year="1998",
volume="43",
number="1",
pages="91--104",
abstract="Computer-optimized treatment plans, aimed to enhance tumour control and reduce normal tissue complication, generally require non-uniform beam intensities. One of the techniques for delivering intensity-modulated beams is the use of dynamic multileaf collimation, where the beam aperture moves and the field shape changes during irradiation. When intensity-modulated beams are delivered with dynamic collimation, the problem of intra-fraction organ motion can cause distortions to the desired beam intensities. Unlike static field treatments, where intra-fraction organ motion only affects the boundaries creating broad dose penumbra, the interplay of the movement of the beam aperture and the movement of the patient anatomy can create ?hot? and ?cold? spots throughout the field. The mechanism for creating these effects is not well understood. This paper provides a simple analytical model which illustrates the fundamental mechanism for creating the dosimetric variations in the target when both the beam aperture and the target move during irradiation. Numerical analysis was carried out which calculates the cumulative primary photon fluence, or beam intensity, received by each point in the target, for a given pattern of motion. The results show that, for clinically realistic parameters, the magnitude of intensity variations in the target can be greater than 100\% of the desired beam intensity. The magnitude of the photon intensity variations is strongly dependent on the speed of the beam aperture relative to the speed of the target motion, and the width of the scanning beam relative to the amplitude of target motion. The effects of fractionation as well as methods of minimizing and eliminating the dosimetric effects of intra-fraction organ motion are discussed",

Carbon doses isoeffective to the x-ray doses were computed with a recently established model for calculation of the biological effect of heavy ions. Clinical changes and physiological symptoms (blood flow, erythema, trans-epidermal water loss, skin hydration) were scored. The parameters analyzed were maximum and mean values of each symptom during days 24 to 70 after irradiation, and the quantal endpoints for the establishment of dose effect curves were the median values of these. With exception of the maximum change in the red blood cell concentration (p < 0.02) no significant differences could be found in the response to x-rays and RBE-corrected heavy ions. These results indicate that the model is valid for the calculation of biological effects of 12C-ions (plateau region) and may at least for epidermis be applied to treatment planning",

abstract="PURPOSE: Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) is a technique designed to deliver prescribed radiation doses to localized tumors with high precision, while effectively excluding the surrounding normal tissues. It facilitates tumor dose escalation which should overcome the relative resistance of tumor clonogens to conventional radiation dose levels. The present study was undertaken to test this hypothesis in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 743 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer were treated with 3D-CRT. As part of a phase I study, the tumor target dose was increased from 64.8 to 81 Gy in increments of 5.4 Gy. Tumor response was evaluated by post-treatment decrease of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to levels of < or = 1.0 ng/ml and by sextant prostate biopsies performed > or = 2.5 years after completion of 3D-CRT. PSA relapse-free survival was used to evaluate long-term outcome. The median follow-up was 3 years (range: 1-7.6 years). RESULTS: Induction of an initial clinical response was dose-dependent, with 90\% of patients receiving 75.6 or 81.0 Gy achieving a PSA nadir < or = 1.0 ng compared with 76\% and 56\% for those treated with 70.2 Gy and 64.8 Gy, respectively (p < 0.001). The 5-year actuarial PSA relapse-free survival for patients with favorable prognostic indicators (stage T1-2, pretreatment PSA < or = 10.0 ng/ml and Gleason score < or = 6) was 85\%, compared to 65\% for those with intermediate prognosis (one of the prognostic indicators with a higher value) and 35\% for the group with unfavorable prognosis (two or more indicators with higher values) (p < 0.001). PSA relapse-free survival was significantly improved in patients with intermediate and unfavorable prognosis receiving > or = 75.6 Gy (p < 0.05). A positive biopsy at > or = 2.5 years after 3D-CRT was observed in only 1/15 (7\%) of patients receiving 81.0 Gy, compared with 12/25 (48\%) after 75.6 Gy, 19/42 (45\%) after 70.2 Gy, and 13/23 (57\%) after 64.8 Gy (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The data provide evidence for a significant effect of dose escalation on the response of human prostate cancer to irradiation and defines new standards for curative radiotherapy in this disease",

abstract="PURPOSE: To report the acute and late toxicity and preliminary biochemical outcomes in 772 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer treated with high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between April 1996 and January 2001, 772 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer were treated with IMRT. Treatment was planned using an inverse-planning approach, and the desired beam intensity profiles were delivered by dynamic multileaf collimation. A total of 698 patients (90\%) were treated to 81.0 Gy, and 74 patients (10\%) were treated to 86.4 Gy. Acute and late toxicities were scored by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group morbidity grading scales. PSA relapse was defined according to The American Society of Therapeutic Radiation Oncology Consensus Statement. The median follow-up time was 24 months (range: 6-60 months). RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (4.5\%) developed acute Grade 2 rectal toxicity, and no patient experienced acute Grade 3 or higher rectal symptoms. Two hundred seventeen patients (28\%) developed acute Grade 2 urinary symptoms, and one experienced urinary retention (Grade 3). Eleven patients (1.5\%) developed late Grade 2 rectal bleeding. Four patients (0.1\%) experienced Grade 3 rectal toxicity requiring either one or more transfusions or a laser cauterization procedure. No Grade 4 rectal complications have been observed. The 3-year actuarial likelihood of >/= late Grade 2 rectal toxicity was 4\%. Seventy-two patients (9\%) experienced late Grade 2 urinary toxicity, and five (0.5\%) developed Grade 3 urinary toxicity (urethral stricture). The 3-year actuarial likelihood of >/= late Grade 2 urinary toxicity was 15\%. The 3-year actuarial PSA relapse-free survival rates for favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable risk group patients were 92\%, 86\%, and 81\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the feasibility of high-dose IMRT in a large number of patients. Acute and late rectal toxicities seem to be significantly reduced compared with what has been observed with conventional three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy techniques. Short-term PSA control rates seem to be at least comparable to those achieved with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy at similar dose levels. Based on this favorable risk:benefit ratio, IMRT has become the standard mode of conformal treatment delivery for localized prostate cancer at our institution",

abstract="PURPOSE: To compare toxicity profiles and biochemical tumor control outcomes between patients treated with high-dose image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) and high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for clinically localized prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2008 and 2009, 186 patients with prostate cancer were treated with IGRT to a dose of 86.4 Gy with daily correction of the target position based on kilovoltage imaging of implanted prostatic fiducial markers. This group of patients was retrospectively compared with a similar cohort of 190 patients who were treated between 2006 and 2007 with IMRT to the same prescription dose without, however, implanted fiducial markers in place (non-IGRT). The median follow-up time was 2.8 years (range, 2-6 years). RESULTS: A significant reduction in late urinary toxicity was observed for IGRT patients compared with the non-IGRT patients. The 3-year likelihood of grade 2 and higher urinary toxicity for the IGRT and non-IGRT cohorts were 10.4\% and 20.0\%, respectively (p = 0.02). Multivariate analysis identifying predictors for grade 2 or higher late urinary toxicity demonstrated that, in addition to the baseline Internatinoal Prostate Symptom Score, IGRT was associated with significantly less late urinary toxicity compared with non-IGRT. The incidence of grade 2 and higher rectal toxicity was low for both treatment groups (1.0\% and 1.6\%, respectively; p = 0.81). No differences in prostate-specific antigen relapse-free survival outcomes were observed for low- and intermediate-risk patients when treated with IGRT and non-IGRT. For high-risk patients, a significant improvement was observed at 3 years for patients treated with IGRT compared with non-IGRT. CONCLUSIONS: IGRT is associated with an improvement in biochemical tumor control among high-risk patients and a lower rate of late urinary toxicity compared with high-dose IMRT. These data suggest that, for definitive radiotherapy, the placement of fiducial markers and daily tracking of target positioning may represent the preferred mode of external-beam radiotherapy delivery for the treatment of prostate cancer",

abstract="Treating moving targets using a scanning gantry for proton therapy is a promising but very challenging, not yet clinically demonstrated treatment modality. The interference of organ motion with the sequence of the beam delivery produces uncontrolled dose inhomogeneities within the target. One promising approach to overcome this difficulty is to increase the speed of scanning in order to apply the dose repeatedly (so-called repainting). To obtain sufficiently high scanning speeds a new, technologically improved gantry-Gantry 2-has been designed and is currently under construction at PSI. As there are many possible repainting strategies, the way repainting will be implemented on Gantry 2 will depend on the result of a careful analysis of the various treatment delivery strategies available. To achieve this aim, and prior to the start of experimental work with Gantry 2, simulations of dose distribution errors due to organ motion under various beam delivery strategies were investigated. The effects of motion on the dose distribution were studied for moderate motion amplitudes (5 mm) for spherical target volumes in a homogeneous medium and with homogeneous dose. In total over 200 000 dose distributions have been simulated and analyzed and selected results are discussed. From the obtained results we are confident to be able to treat moderately moving targets on Gantry 2 using repainted pencil-beam spot scanning. Continuous line scanning seems to be the most elegant solution; it provides higher repainting rates and produces superior results but is probably more difficult to realize. For larger motion amplitudes, continuous line scanning still shows good results, but we plan anyways to use a gating system for these cases, not only to reduce the inhomogeneity within the target volume but also to reduce safety margins",

abstract="PURPOSE: To assess the relationship between biologically effective dose (BED) and efficacy of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and to explore the optimal BED range for Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligible studies were identified on Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and the proceedings of annual meetings through June 2010. According to the quartile of included studies, BED was divided into four dose groups: low (<83.2 Gy), medium (83.2-106 Gy), medium to high (106-146 Gy), high (>146 Gy). To obtain pooled estimates of overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and local control rate (LCR), data were combined in a random effect model. Pooled estimates were corrected for the percentage of small tumors (<3 cm). RESULTS: Thirty-four observational studies with a total of 2,587 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Corrected pooled estimates of 2- or 3-year OS in the medium BED (76.1\%, 63.5\%) or the medium to high BED (68.3\%, 63.2\%) groups were higher than in the low (62.3\%, 51.9\%) or high groups (55.9\%, 49.5\%), respectively (p </= 0.004). Corrected 3-year CSS in the medium (79.5\%), medium to high (80.6\%), and high groups (90.0\%) were higher than in the low group (70.1\%, p = 0.016, 0.018, 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: The OS for the medium or medium to high BED groups were higher than those for the low or high BED group for SBRT in Stage I NSCLC. The medium or medium to high BED (range, 83.2-146 Gy) for SBRT may currently be more beneficial and reasonable in Stage I NSCLC",

abstract="Use of internal fiducial markers and electronic portal imaging (EPI) to realign patients has been shown to significantly reduce positioning uncertainties in prostate radiation treatment. This creates the possibility of improving the treatment by decreasing the planning target volume (PTV) margin added to the clinical target volume (CTV), which in turn may allow dose escalation. Conformal treatment plans for three prostate cancer patients were evaluated by using different PTV margins with dose prescription of 70 Gy/35 fr initially. Two beam arrangements, 4-field-box (4FB) and 4-field-oblique (4FO), were used. Then, two dose escalation schemes, 74 Gy and 78 Gy, with tighter PTV margins, were chosen from the first simulation and were tested. A Monte Carlo model was developed to simulate the daily geometric uncertainty and calculate the dose to each organ. After the whole treatment, dose-volume histograms were produced and tumour control probability, prostate equivalent uniform dose and the effective dose to critical organs were calculated. By comparing these radiobiological metrics, optimized dose escalation schemes were found. The results show that using internal fiducial markers and EPI, the prescription dose can be escalated to 78 Gy/39 fr with a 4 mm PTV margin. Based on the available dose-response data for intermediate risk prostate patients, this is estimated to result in a 20\% increase of local control and significantly reduced rectal complications",

abstract="PURPOSE: Real-time target tracking (RT-TT) and four-dimensional inverse planning (4D-IP) are two potential methods to manage respiratory target motion. In this study, we evaluated each method using the cumulative dose-volume criteria in lung cancer radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Respiration-correlated computed tomography scans were acquired for 4 patients. Deformable image registration was applied to generate a displacement mapping for each phase image of the respiration-correlated computed tomography images. First, the dose distribution for the organs of interest obtained from an idealized RT-TT technique was evaluated, assuming perfect knowledge of organ motion and beam tracking. Inverse planning was performed on each phase image separately. The treatment dose to the organs of interest was then accumulated from the optimized plans. Second, 4D-IP was performed using the probability density function of respiratory motion. The beam arrangement, prescription dose, and objectives were consistent in both planning methods. The dose-volume and equivalent uniform dose in the target volume, lung, heart, and spinal cord were used for the evaluation. RESULTS: The cumulative dose in the target was similar for both techniques. The equivalent uniform dose of the lung, heart, and spinal cord was 4.6 +/- 2.2, 11 +/- 4.4, and 11 +/- 6.6 Gy for RT-TT with a 0-mm target margin, 5.2 +/- 3.1, 12 +/- 5.9, and 12 +/- 7.8 Gy for RT-TT with a 2-mm target margin, and 5.3 +/- 2.3, 11.9 +/- 5.0, and 12 +/- 5.6 Gy for 4D-IP, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results of our study have shown that 4D-IP can achieve plans similar to those achieved by RT-TT. Considering clinical implementation, 4D-IP could be a more reliable and practical method to manage patient respiration-induced motion",

abstract="The modeling of respiratory motion is important for a more accurate understanding and accounting of its effect on dose to cancers in the thorax and abdomen by radiotherapy. We have developed a model of respiration-induced organ motion in the thorax without the commonly adopted assumption of repeatable breath cycles. The model describes the motion of a volume of interest within the patient based on a reference three-dimensional (3D) image (at end expiration) and the diaphragm positions at different time points. The input data are respiration-correlated CT (RCCT) images of patients treated for non-small- cell lung cancer, consisting of 3D images, including the diaphragm positions, at ten phases of the respiratory cycle. A deformable image registration algorithm calculates the deformation field that maps each 3D image to the reference 3D image. A principal component analysis is performed to parameterize the 3D deformation field in terms of the diaphragm motion. We show that the first two principal components are adequate to accurately and completely describe the organ motion in the data of four patients. Artifacts in the RCCT images that commonly occur at the mid-respiration states are reduced in the model-generated images. Further validation of the model is demonstrated in the successful application of the parameterized 3D deformation field to RCCT data of the same patient but acquired several days later. We have developed a method for predicting respiration-induced organ motion in patients that has potential for improving the accuracy of dose calculation in radiotherapy. Possible limitations of the model are cases where the correlation between lung tumor and diaphragm position is less reliable such as superiorly situated tumors and interfraction changes in tumor-diaphragm correlation. The limited number of clinical cases examined suggests, but does not confirm, the model's applicability to a wide range of patients",

abstract="Photobiomodulation with near infrared light (NIR) provides cellular protection in various disease models. Previously, infrared light emitted by a low-energy laser has been shown to significantly improve recovery from ischemic injury of the canine heart. The goal of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that NIR (670 nm) from light emitting diodes produces cellular protection against hypoxia and reoxygenation-induced cardiomyocyte injury. Additionally, nitric oxide (NO) was investigated as a potential cellular mediator of NIR. Our results demonstrate that exposure to NIR at the time of reoxygenation protects neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and HL-1 cells from injury, as assessed by lactate dehydrogenase release and MTT assay. Similarly, indices of apoptosis, including caspase 3 activity, annexin binding and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, were decreased after NIR treatment. NIR increased NO in cardiomyocytes, and the protective effect of NIR was completely reversed by the NO scavengers carboxy-PTIO and oxyhemoglobin, but only partially blocked by the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NMMA. Mitochondrial metabolism, measured by ATP synthase activity, was increased by NIR, and NO-induced inhibition of oxygen consumption with substrates for complex I or complex IV was reversed by exposure to NIR. Taken together these data provide evidence for protection against hypoxia and reoxygenation injury in cardiomyocytes by NIR in a manner that is dependent upon NO derived from NOS and non-NOS sources",

abstract="The signal from a spirometer is directly correlated with respiratory motion and is ideal for target respiratory motion tracking. However, its susceptibility to signal drift deters its application in radiotherapy. In this work, a few approaches are investigated to control spirometer signal drift for a Bernoulli-type spirometer. A method is presented for rapid daily calibration of the spirometer to obtain a flow sensitivity function. Daily calibration assures accurate airflow measurement and also reduces signal drift. Dynamic baseline adjustment further controls the signal drift. The accuracy of these techniques was studied and it was found that the spirometer is able to provide a long-term drift-free breathing signal. The tracking error is comprised of two components: calibration error and stochastic signal baseline variation error. The calibration error is very small (1\% of 3 l) and therefore negligible. The stochastic baseline variation error can be as large as 20\% of the normal breathing amplitude. In view of these uncertainties, the applications of spirometers in treatment techniques that rely on breathing monitoring are discussed. Spirometer-based monitoring is noted most suitable for deep inspiration breath-hold but less important for free breathing gating techniques",

abstract="Similar to conventional conformal radiotherapy, during lung tomotherapy, a motion margin has to be set for respiratory motion. Consequently, large volume of normal tissue is irradiated by intensive radiation. To solve this problem, we have developed a new motion mitigation method by incorporating target motion into treatment optimization. In this method, the delivery-breathing correlation is determined prior to treatment plan optimization. Beamlets are calculated by using the CT images at the corresponding breathing phases from a dynamic (four-dimensional) image sequence. With the displacement vector fields at different breathing phases, a set of deformed beamlets is obtained by mapping the dose to the primary phase. Optimization incorporating motion is then performed by using the deformed beamlets obtained by dose mapping. During treatment delivery, the same breathing-delivery correlation can be reproduced by instructing the patient to breathe following a visually displayed guiding cycle. This method was tested using a computer-simulated deformable phantom and a real lung case. Results show that treatment optimization incorporating motion achieved similar high dose conformality on a mobile target compared with static delivery. The residual motion effects due to imperfect breathing tracking were also analyzed",

abstract="Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) can be used to treat small lesions in the chest. A vacuum-based immobilization system is used in our clinic for SBRT, and a motion envelope is used in treatment planning. The purpose of this study is to automatically derive motion envelopes using deformable image registration of 4D-CT images, and to assess the effect of abdominal pressure on the motion envelopes. 4D-CT scans at ten phases were acquired prior to treatment for both free and restricted breathing using a vacuum-based immobilization system that includes an abdominal pressure pillow. To study the stability of the motion envelope over the course of treatment, a mid-treatment 4D-CT scan was obtained after delivery of the third fraction for two patients. The planning target volume excluding breathing motion (PTV(ex)) was defined on the image set at full exhalation phase and transformed into all other phases using displacement maps from deformable image registration. The motion envelope was obtained as the union of PTV(ex) masks of all phases. The ratios of the motion envelope to PTV(ex) volume ranged from 1.3 to 2.5. When pressure was applied, the ratios were reduced by as much as 29\% compared to free breathing for some patients, but increased by up to 9\% for others. The abdominal pressure pillow has more motion restriction effects on the anterior/inferior region of the lung. For one of the two patients for whom the 4D-CT scan was repeated at mid-treatment, the motion envelope was reproducible. However, for the other patient the tumor location and lung motion pattern significantly changed due to changes in the anatomy surrounding the tumor during the course of treatment, indicating that an image-guided approach to SBRT may increase the efficacy of this treatment",

abstract="PURPOSE: To introduce a four-dimensional (4D) tomotherapy treatment technique with improved motion control and patient tolerance. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Computed tomographic images at 10 breathing phases were acquired for treatment planning. The full exhalation phase was chosen as the planning phase, and the CT images at this phase were used as treatment-planning images. Region of interest delineation was the same as in traditional treatment planning, except that no breathing motion margin was used in clinical target volume-planning target volume expansion. The correlation between delivery and breathing phases was set assuming a constant gantry speed and a fixed breathing period. Deformable image registration yielded the deformation fields at each phase relative to the planning phase. With the delivery/breathing phase correlation and voxel displacements at each breathing phase, a 4D tomotherapy plan was obtained by incorporating the motion into inverse treatment plan optimization. A combined laser/spirometer breathing tracking system has been developed to monitor patient breathing. This system is able to produce stable and reproducible breathing signals representing tidal volume. RESULTS: We compared the 4D tomotherapy treatment planning method with conventional tomotherapy on a static target. The results showed that 4D tomotherapy can achieve dose distributions on a moving target similar to those obtained with conventional delivery on a stationary target. Regular breathing motion is fully compensated by motion-incorporated breathing-synchronized delivery planning. Four-dimensional tomotherapy also has close to 100\% duty cycle and does not prolong treatment time. CONCLUSION: Breathing-synchronized delivery is a feasible 4D tomotherapy treatment technique with improved motion control and patient tolerance",

abstract="PURPOSE: To determine the dosimetric impact of interfraction anatomic movements in prostate cancer patients receiving proton therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For each of the 10 patients studied, 8 computed tomography (CT) scans were selected from sets of daily setup CT images that were acquired from a cohort of prostate cancer patients. The images were acquired in the treatment room using the CT-on-rails system. First, standard proton therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans were designed for each patient using standard modality-specific methods. The images, the proton plan, and the IMRT plan were then aligned to the eight CT images based on skin marks. The doses were recalculated on these eight CT images using beam from the standard plans. Second, the plans were redesigned and evaluated assuming a smaller clinical target volume to planning target volume margin (3 mm). The images and the corresponding plans were then realigned based on the center of volume of the prostate. Dose distributions were evaluated using isodose displays, dose-volume histograms, and target coverage. RESULTS: For the skin-marker alignment method, 4 of the 10 IMRT plans were deficient, whereas 3 of 10 proton plans were compromised. For the alignment method based on the center of volume of the prostate, only the proton plan for 1 patient was deficient, whereas 3 of the 10 IMRT plans were suboptimal. CONCLUSION: A comparison of passively scattered proton therapy and highly conformal IMRT plans for prostate cancer revealed that the dosimetric impact of interfractional anatomic motions was similar for both modalities",

abstract="PURPOSE: To compare three-dimensional (3D) and four-dimensional (4D) computed tomography (CT)-based treatment plans for proton therapy or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for esophageal cancer in terms of doses to the lung, heart, and spinal cord and variations in target coverage and normal tissue sparing. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The IMRT and proton plans for 15 patients with distal esophageal cancer were designed from the 3D average CT scans and then recalculated on 10 4D CT data sets. Dosimetric data were compared for tumor coverage and normal tissue sparing. RESULTS: Compared with IMRT, median lung volumes exposed to 5, 10, and 20 Gy and mean lung dose were reduced by 35.6\%, 20.5\%, 5.8\%, and 5.1 Gy for a two-beam proton plan and by 17.4\%, 8.4\%, 5\%, and 2.9 Gy for a three-beam proton plan. The greater lung sparing in the two-beam proton plan was achieved at the expense of less conformity to the target (conformity index [CI], 1.99) and greater irradiation of the heart (heart-V40, 41.8\%) compared with the IMRT plan(CI, 1.55, heart-V40, 35.7\%) or the three-beam proton plan (CI, 1.46, heart-V40, 27.7\%). Target coverage differed by more than 2\% between the 3D and 4D plans for patients with substantial diaphragm motion in the three-beam proton and IMRT plans. The difference in spinal cord maximum dose between 3D and 4D plans could exceed 5 Gy for the proton plans partly owing to variations in stomach gas filling. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy provided significantly better sparing of lung than did IMRT. Diaphragm motion and stomach gas-filling must be considered in evaluating target coverage and cord doses",

abstract="Proton therapy with active scanning beam delivery has significant advantages compared to conventional radiotherapy. However, so far only static targets have been treated in this way, since moving targets potentially lead to interplay effects. For 4D treatment planning, information on the target motion is needed to calculate time-resolved dose distributions. In this study, respiratory liver motion has been extracted from 4D CT data using two deformable image registration algorithms. In moderately moving patient cases (mean motion range around 6 mm), the registration error was no more than 3 mm, while it reached 7 mm for larger motions (range around 13 mm). The obtained deformation fields have then been used to calculate different time-resolved 4D treatment plans. Averaged over both motion estimations, interplay effects can increase the D(5)-D(95) value for the clinical target volume (CTV) from 8.8\% in a static plan to 23.4\% when motion is considered. It has also been found that the different deformable registration algorithms can provide different motion estimations despite performing similarly for the selected landmarks, which in turn can lead to differing 4D dose distributions. Especially for single-field treatments where no motion mitigation is used, a maximum (mean) dose difference (averaged over three cases) of 32.8\% (2.9\%) can be observed. However, this registration ambiguity-induced uncertainty can be reduced if rescanning is applied or if the treatment plan consists of multiple fields, where the maximum (mean) difference can decrease to 15.2\% (0.57\%). Our results indicate the necessity to interpret 4D dose distributions for scanned proton therapy with some caution or with error bars to reflect the uncertainties resulting from the motion estimation. On the other hand, rescanning has been found to be an appropriate motion mitigation technique and, furthermore, has been shown to be a robust approach to also deal with these motion estimation uncertainties",

abstract="Compensator-based proton therapy of lung cancer using an un-gated treatment while allowing the patient to breathe freely requires a compensator design that ensures tumor coverage throughout respiration. Our investigation had two purposes: one is to investigate the dosimetric impact when a composite compensator correction is applied, or is not, and the other one is to evaluate the significance of using different respiratory phases as the reference computed tomography (CT) for treatment planning dose calculations. A 4D-CT-based phantom study and a real patient treatment planning study were performed. A 3D MIP dataset generated over all phases of the acquired 4D-CT scans was adopted to design the field-specific composite aperture and compensator. In the phantom study, the MIP-based compensator design plan named plan D was compared to the other three plans, in which average intensity projection (AIP) images in conjunction with the composite target volume contour copied from the MIP images were used. Relative electron densities within the target envelope were assigned either to original values from the AIP image dataset (plan A) or to predetermined values, 0.8 (plan B) and 0.9 (plan C). In the patient study, the dosimetric impact of a compensator design based on the MIP images (plan ITV(MIP)) was compared to designs based on end-of-inhale (EOI) (plan ITV(EOI)) and middle-of-exhale (MOE) CT images (plan ITV(MOE)). The dose distributions were recalculated for each phase. Throughout the ten phases, it shows that D(GTV)(min) changed slightly from 86\% to 89\% (SD = 0.9\%) of prescribed dose (PD) in the MIP plan, while varying greatly from 10\% to 79\% (SD = 26.7\%) in plan A, 17\% to 73\% (SD = 22.5\%) in plan B and 53\% to 73\% (SD = 6.8\%) in plan C. The same trend was observed for D(GTV)(mean) and V95 with less amplitude. In the MIP-based plan ITV(MIP), D(GTV)(mean) was almost identically equal to 95\% in each phase (SD = 0.5\%). The patient study verified that the MIP approach increased the minimum value of D99 of the clinical target volume (CTV) by 58.8\% compared to plan ITV(EOI) and 12.9\% compared to plan ITV(MOE). Minimum values of D99 were 37.60\%, 83.50\% and 96.40\% for plan ITV(EOI), plan ITV(MOE) and plan ITV(MIP), respectively. Standard deviations of D99 were significantly decreased (SD = 0.5\%) in the MIP plan as compared to plan ITV(EOI) (SD = 18.9\%) or plan ITV(MOE) (SD = 4.0\%). These studies demonstrate that the use of MIP images to design the patient-specific composite compensators provide superior and consistent tumor coverage throughout the entire respiratory cycle whilst maintaining a low average normal lung dose. The additional benefit of the MIP-based design approach is that the dose calculation can be implemented on any single phase as long as it uses the aperture and compensator optimized from the MIP images. This also reduces the requirement for contouring on all breathing phases down to just one",

abstract="PURPOSE: To describe our experiences with patient-specific quality assurance (QA) for patients with prostate cancer receiving spot scanning proton therapy (SSPT) using single-field uniform dose (SFUD). METHODS AND MATERIALS: The first group of 249 patients with prostate cancer treated with SSPT using SFUD was included in this work. The scanning-beam planning target volume and number of monitor units were recorded and checked for consistency. Patient-specific dosimetric measurements were performed, including the point dose for each plan, depth doses, and two-dimensional (2D) dose distribution in the planes perpendicular to the incident beam direction for each field at multiple depths. The gamma-index with 3\% dose or 3-mm distance agreement criteria was used to evaluate the 2D dose distributions. RESULTS: We observed a linear relationship between the number of monitor units and scanning-beam planning target volume. The difference between the measured and calculated point doses (mean +/- SD) was 0.0\% +/- 0.7\% (range, -2.9\% to 1.8\%). In general, the depth doses exhibited good agreement except at the distal end of the spread-out Bragg peak. The pass rate of gamma-index (mean +/- SD) for 2D dose comparison was 96.2\% +/- 2.6\% (range, 90-100\%). Discrepancies between the measured and calculated dose distributions primarily resulted from the limitation of the model used by the treatment planning system. CONCLUSIONS: We have established a patient-specific QA program for prostate cancer patients receiving SSPT using SFUD",

abstract="CONTEXT: Clinically localized prostate cancer is very prevalent among US men, but recurrence after treatment with conventional radiation therapy is common. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hypothesis that increasing the radiation dose delivered to men with clinically localized prostate cancer improves disease outcome. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized controlled trial of 393 patients with stage T1b through T2b prostate cancer and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels less than 15 ng/mL randomized between January 1996 and December 1999 and treated at 2 US academic institutions. Median age was 67 years and median PSA level was 6.3 ng/mL. Median follow-up was 5.5 (range, 1.2-8.2) years. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to receive external beam radiation to a total dose of either 70.2 Gy (conventional dose) or 79.2 Gy (high dose). This was delivered using a combination of conformal photon and proton beams. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Increasing PSA level (ie, biochemical failure) 5 years after treatment. RESULTS: The proportions of men free from biochemical failure at 5 years were 78.8\% [corrected] (95\% confidence interval, 73.1\%-84.6\%) [corrected] for conventional-dose and 91.3\% [corrected] (95\% confidence interval, 87.2\%-95.4\%) [corrected] for high-dose therapy (P<.001), a 59\% [corrected] reduction in the risk of failure. The advantage to high-dose therapy was statistically significant [corrected] in both the low-risk subgroup [corrected] (risk reduction, 84\% [P<.001]) [corrected] There has been no significant difference in overall survival rates between the treatment groups. Only 1\% of patients receiving conventional-dose and 2\% receiving high-dose radiation experienced acute urinary or rectal morbidity of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 3 or greater. So far, only 2\% and 1\%, respectively, have experienced late morbidity of RTOG grade 3 or greater. CONCLUSIONS: Men with clinically localized prostate cancer have a lower risk of biochemical failure if they receive high-dose rather than conventional-dose conformal radiation. This advantage was achieved without any associated increase in RTOG grade 3 acute or late urinary or rectal morbidity",

abstract="Background Intensity modulated arc therapy (IMAT) has been widely adopted for Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) for lung cancer. While treatment dose is optimized and calculated on a static Computed Tomography (CT) image, the effect of the interplay between the target and linac multi-leaf collimator (MLC) motion is not well described and may result in deviations between delivered and planned dose. In this study, we investigated the dosimetric consequences of the inter-play effect on target and organs at risk (OAR) by simulating dynamic dose delivery using dynamic CT datasets. Methods Fifteen stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with greater than 10 mm tumor motion treated with SBRT in 4 fractions to a dose of 50 Gy were retrospectively analyzed for this study. Each IMAT plan was initially optimized using two arcs. Simulated dynamic delivery was performed by associating the MLC leaf position, gantry angle and delivered beam monitor units (MUs) for each control point with different respiratory phases of the 4D-CT using machine delivery log files containing time stamps of the control points. Dose maps associated with each phase of the 4D-CT dose were calculated in the treatment planning system and accumulated using deformable image registration onto the exhale phase of the 4D-CT. The original IMAT plans were recalculated on the exhale phase of the CT for comparison with the dynamic simulation. Results The dose coverage of the PTV showed negligible variation between the static and dynamic simulation. There was less than 1.5\% difference in PTV V95\% and V90\%. The average inter-fraction and cumulative dosimetric effects among all the patients were less than 0.5\% for PTV V95\% and V90\% coverage and 0.8 Gy for the OARs. However, in patients where target is close to the organs, large variations were observed on great vessels and bronchus for as much as 4.9 Gy and 7.8 Gy. Conclusions Limited variation in target dose coverage and OAR constraints were seen for each SBRT fraction as well as over all four fractions. Large dose variations were observed on critical organs in patients where these organs were closer to the target.",

abstract="A cone-beam computed tomography (CT) system utilizing a proton beam has been developed and tested. The cone beam is produced by scattering a 160 MeV proton beam with a modifier that results in a signal in the detector system, which decreases monotonically with depth in the medium. The detector system consists of a Gd2O2S:Tb intensifying screen viewed by a cooled CCD camera. The Feldkamp-Davis-Kress cone-beam reconstruction algorithm is applied to the projection data to obtain the CT voxel data representing proton stopping power. The system described is capable of reconstructing data over a 16 x 16 x 16 cm3 volume into 512 x 512 x 512 voxels. A spatial and contrast resolution phantom was scanned to determine the performance of the system. Spatial resolution is significantly degraded by multiple Coulomb scattering effects. Comparison of the reconstructed proton CT values with x-ray CT derived proton stopping powers shows that there may be some advantage to obtaining stopping powers directly with proton CT. The system described suggests a possible practical method of obtaining this measurement in vivo",
