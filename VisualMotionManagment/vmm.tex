\section{Introduction}

As explained in Section \textbf{ref!} effects of motion can have a significant impact on a radiation treatment. Therefore a proper investigation is necessary for each specific patient. There are several motion mitigation techniques available that can operate on beam delivery, patient immobilization or treatment planning level.

An important part of motion mitigation is proper and frequent imaging. While most commercial treatment planning software provide rigid registration between different images, deformable image registration (DIR) is currently rarely used. 
DIR ca quantify anatomical and biological variations better compared to rigid registration \cite{Sarrut2006} and is essential as well in photon as in ion radiotherapy, with usage in adaptive radiotherapy \cite{Yan1997,Yan2010}, 
4D optimization \cite{Trofimov2005}, 4D dose calculation \cite{Flampouri2006}, contour propagation \cite{Lu2006b}. DIR usage spreads even into other categories, besides radiotherapy \cite{Cleary2010, Herrell2012, Nithiananthan2011, Naini2010}.
Several different DIR algorithms are available, such as B-spline \cite{Rueckert1999}, Demons \cite{Thirion1998}, linear elastic finite element \cite{Venugopal2005}, optical flow \cite{Zhong2007}, viscous fluid \cite{Christensen1996}, etc.
	
One of the reasons for the DIR is not used in commercial software is the lack of proper DIR quality assurance (DIRQA). While several different DIRQA methods exist, none of them are definitive and most of them are time consuming. 
It is possible to evaluate DIR with deformable phantoms, where the type and size of deformation is known \cite{Kashani2007, Kirby2011}. However such quality assurance is time consuming and it would be hard to use it 
in everyday clinical work flow DIR validation can also be based on landmark positions, specifically their location before and after registration. In absence of externally planted markers, locating landmarks in patient 
anatomy can be take a fair amount of time and it can be difficult to identify landmarks in low-contrast regions \cite{Varadhan2013}. Another option is to compare delineated contours with the propagated ones. 
It is more efficient technique than landmark checks, however it is even more time consuming and it does not address the region within the contour.

In this chapter tools to handle DIR and DIRQA will be presented. Tools were constructed for open-source software 3D Slicer, described in Section~\ref{Slicer}. 
In Section~\ref{RegistrationImplement} details on how DIR was performed will be explained. Next, Section~\ref{DIRQA} will address the DIR validation - an extensive tool was created with various functionalities to tackle DIRQA.
DIR and DIRQA tools were tested on a real patient data and results will be presented in the Section~\ref{Verification}. Lastly, everything will be summed up in Section~\ref{Summary}.

\section{Implementation}
\label{Implementation}

\subsection{3D Slicer}
\label{Slicer}

3D Slicer (Slicer) is a software platform for analysis and visualization of medical images \cite{Slicer, Fedorov2012}. Slicer is a free, open-source software (BSD-style license) available on Windows, MacOSX and Linux operating systems. 
It comes with a vast variety of tools, such as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Handling a variety of image formats, including DICOM, NRRD and MHA
	\item Visualization of voxel images, polygonal meshes and volume renderings
	\item Registration tool (rigid and non-rigid) and display of vector fields
	\item Automatic image segmentation
	\item Analysis and visualization of diffusion tensor image data
	\item Device tracking for image-guided procedures
\end{itemize}

The foundation of Slicer is written in C++ and it's functions can be accessed also with Python to provide rapid, iterative development. Graphical user interface is built in Qt. Visualization is based on VTK, a graphical library commonly
used in scientific research.

Slicer is a research tool and as such offers tools to implement new functionalities in the form of extensions (modules). They can either be execution of external command-line program, or writing modules with new features,
or automate Slicer processes in form of scripted modules. In the next sections different Slicer modules will be presented, which were all developed in the scope of this thesis. 
The purpose of modules is to perform DIR and provide validation of the the obtained results.

\newpage
\subsubsection{Registration nomenclature}

To provide a clear and consistent description of methods used, an overview of the expressions is given here.

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Reference image} - image that serves as a reference position in registration (image that is registered to).
 \item \textbf{Moving image} - image that is being registered to the reference image (image that is registered from).
 \item \textbf{Warped image} - result of applying transformation map of registration to moving image. It should be as close to the reference image as possible.
 \item \textbf{True registration} - registration from moving to reference image. Similar, everything connected to true registration will use \"true\" (true vector field, true warped image, true absolute difference, true Jacobian, etc.).
 \item \textbf{Inverse registration} - registration from reference to moving image (opposite or inverse of true registration. As in true registration, term inverse can be used for everything connected to it (inverse vector field, inverse warped image, inverse absolute difference, inverse Jacobian, etc.).
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Registration}
\label{RegistrationImplement}

Plastimatch \cite{Shackleford2010} is a commonly used software for registration in medical research. It is free and open-source software, available as a command-line executable program. 
Plastimatch B-spline registration is also available in Slicer as part of an extension SlicerRT \cite{Pinter2012}.
The integration of Plastimatch in Slicer brings the advantage of a graphical user interface and hence a quick modification of parameters and display of results. However, the disadvantage comes when a large number of registrations is required,
since a user presence is required. In a complete 4DCT registration there are $2(N-1)$ registrations required - from reference phase to each of $N$ phases of 4DCT and vice versa, except for the reference phase itself. 
Typical 4DCT consist of 10 phases, therefore a automatic registration of a 4DCT is a necessity.

Automatic DIR was constructed from two parts. First, a DIR Python class was written to handle image locations, store DIR parameters, to preform DIR in the Plastimatch module, to use right naming conventions and to store all output files (vector fields and warped images). 
DIR Python class is shown in Appendix~\ref{RegHierarchy}.

Beside DIR Python Class a patient hierarchy concept was introduced to handle loading of different phases in Slicer and track progress of DIR and DIRQA. It is explained in the next Section.


\subsubsection{Patient hierarchy} 
\label{PatHierarchy}

Patient hierarchy follows a subject hierarchy principle in Slicer. It was designed for a clear overview of the registration process, DIRQA and all resulting files. Another reason is to track DIR
and DIRQA in case if they are interrupted by Slicer crash. DIR and DIRQA files can be quite large and can cause Slicer to run out of memory. With patient hierarchy Slicer is able to continue work
from where it was interrupted rather than starting anew.

There are several levels in patient hierarchy. Each level also has different attributes, where details regarding each level can be written.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Level 1: \textbf{Patient name} - separates different patients.
	\item Level 2: \textbf{Registration node} - separates between different registration, e.g. registration between 4DCT phases, between CT and 4DCT, MRI and CT... 
	\subitem \textit{Attributes:}
	\subitem - The file directory of images, vector fields and registration quality files.
	\subitem - Number of phases to be registered.
	\subitem - Reference phase
	\item Level 3: \textbf{Registration phase} - specific registration phase. Registration is done between all phases and the reference one. There have to be at least two phases
	\item Level 4: \textbf{Node} - can be either an image, a vector field, an inverse vector field or any of DIRQA nodes (see Section~\ref{DIRQA}).
	\subitem \textit{Attributes:}
	\subitem - Exact file paths for specific node.
	\subitem - Statistical values if node is absolute difference, Jacobian or inverse consistency (see Section~\ref{DIRQA}).
\end{itemize}

Patient hierarchy can be constructed in two ways. First option is to manually crate the whole patient hierarchy, from top to bottom level, with necessary attributes. Second option is to use a automatic script to look 
for files on hard drive and create corresponding levels. The second option is possible only by using proper naming conventions are file names and locations.

\subsection{Registration Quality Checks}
\label{DIRQA}

In order to provide visual and quantitative assessment of the registration quality a \textbf{Deformable Image Registration Quality Assurance} module was created. It provides different image checks (inverse color, checkerboard, absolute difference, flicker, movie and landmark positions) and vector checks (Jacobian and inverse consistency error). Details on all different checks will be explained in this section. Reference and warped image, true and inverse vector are used as inputs for DIRQA module. Additionally, landmarks and region of interest (ROI) can also be used as an input.

Absolute difference, Jacobian and inverse consistency error were build using tools from the ITK library \cite{Yoo2002}.

\subsubsection{Inverse color}
\label{Sec:FalseColor}

A good way to see difference between two images is to overlay them. However, since CT scans are usually displayed in grayscale color code, the differences can be indistinguishable. Especially if the images are quite similar, as reference and warped image usually are. With applying opposite color codes to overlaying images two things are achieved. First, regions were the registration was successful will be in grayscale. And second, the differences between images will be in the color of the image they originate from. In the module we used red and cyan color code for reference and warped image, respectively. See Fig.~\ref{falseColor} for details.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}		
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./Images/falseColor.png}
		\caption{Example of a inverse color overlay. Images (a) and (b) show red and cyan color code, respectively, for a CT scan. (c) displays overlayed inverse colored images before and (d) after registration.}
		\label{falseColor}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\newpage
\subsubsection{Checkerboard}

As the name suggests, checkerboard creates an image of tiles. Each tile alternates between reference and warped image, as shown in Fig.~\ref{checkerboard}. The differences between two images become apparent if there is no smooth transition from one tile to the next. The number of tiles can be manually selected. While the checkerboard offers clear indication of differences, it requires a user to spot them - similar to inverse color.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}		
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./Images/checkerboard.png}
		\caption{Example of a checkerboard image. It consists of tiles alternating between two images. Tiles in image (a) alternate between scans before registration and in image (b) after registration.}
		\label{checkerboard}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Absolute difference} 

To stress the difference between reference and warped image an absolute difference between voxel values is calculated and displayed. New image is generated with voxels populated as the absolute difference between reference and warped image voxel values, as shown in Fig.~\ref{absDiff}. Furthermore, statistical values of absolute differences are calculated (mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum) for quantitative assessment of registration quality (in ideal case all values would be 0).

The absolute difference feature is similar to inverse color, but it displays differences clearer and it also provides quantitative values (see Fig.~\ref{absDiff}. In contrast to inverse color which only relies on user examination. However it does require computational time to generate absolute difference, whereas inverse color is instant.

Absolute difference can be computed between reference and moving image, called default absolute difference, to provide initial difference between images. After the registration it can be done on
true and inverse warped images (true and inverse absolute difference) to show registration results. Usually, registration works on minimizing absolute difference (mean square error metric), so it is a direct indicator
of registration success.

To spare computational time or to focus on a specific region, absolute difference can also be calculated just on a specific ROI (if used as an input). Usually ROI around patient body is selected, rather than calculating on a whole patient image.


\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}		
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./Images/abs.png}
		\caption{Absolute difference image before (a) and after registration (b). The mean absolute difference before registration (default absolute difference) is 62 HU and 31 HU after registration (true absolute difference).}
		\label{absDiff}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Movie}

Medical images are usually quite large - typical CT image consist of $512 \times 512 \times 100$ pixels, which makes inspecting image checks (inverse color, checkerboard, absolute difference) a time-consuming task. Movie feature allows for smoother display of different image slices. User selects which view he would like to inspect (axial, sagital or coronal) and presses start. Selected views then start scrolling from one limit to the other. It allows user to focus on registration details, rather than scrolling through slices.

Movie and flicker (explained in the next section) do not offer any specific registration checks, but improve the process of DIRQA.

\subsubsection{Flicker}

While it is possible to display two images side by side in Slicer, it can sometimes be hard to see fine differences between the two images. Flicker alternates between reference and warped image on a single display at a 0.5 s rate.

\subsubsection{Landmark distances}

Distances between landmark before and after registration are often used to determine registration spatial accuracy \cite{Castillo2009}. 
Landmarks can either be a specific feature in patient anatomy or an external marker. The position of landmarks in the warped image would ideally 
be at the same position as in reference image. The module measures the Euclidean norm between the landmark positions in reference and warped image.

User has to manually select landmarks in reference and moving image. For landmarks based on patient anatomy a selection from physician is required. 
Landmarks from moving image can then be automatically transformed to warped image with registration vector field or they can be manually selected in warped image itself. An example is shown in Fig.~\ref{landmark}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./Images/landmark.png}
\caption{Display of landmarks in three phases - reference, moving and warped phase. Distance before registration (between reference and moving landmark) is 22 mm and after registration
(between reference and warped landmark) is 2 mm.}
\label{landmark}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Jacobian determinant}
\label{Jacobian}

Jacobian determinant (Jacobian) of vector field is used to validate physical behavior of registration \cite{Leow2007}. 
Jacobian of vector field should be positive, since negative Jacobian values correspond to folding, 
which is physically unrealistic for patient anatomy (organs can not be folded) \cite{ Rey2002, Chen2008}. 
Expansions and contractions around a point are indicated by Jacobian values of greater and less than 1, respectively. 

DIRQA module calculates and displays the Jacobian of the vector field, as shown in Fig.~\ref{JacobianImage}. Jacobian statistical values of Jacobian are also calculated. Similar to absolute difference, Jacobian can be calculated inside a ROI rather than on a whole image.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}		
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./Images/jacobian.png}
		\caption{Image of Jacobian overlayed on CT scan. The average value of displayed Jacobian is 0.98 with 0.09 standard deviation.}
		\label{JacobianImage}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Inverse Consistency Error}
\label{ICE}

Inverse consistency error (ICE) is consistently used in literature as one of the main vector field checks \cite{Christensen2001, Bender2009}. The principle is as follows. Suppose we have two vector fields - $u_{AB}$ obtained from registration of image $A$ to $B$ and $u_{BA}$ from registration of image $B$ to $A$. The two registrations
should be preformed separately. In an ideal scenario, $u_{AB}$ would be a direct inverse of $u_{BA}$. However, DIR algorithms do not yield perfectly inverse consistent vector fields. Therefore, the differences between true and inverse vector fields have to be examined.


To check for ICE, an algorithm was created that first transforms point in image $A$, $x$ using $u_{AB}$. Newly obtained point $x'$ is then transformed with inverse vector
field, $u_{BA}$ which yields $x''$. The ICE is defined as Euclidean norm between $x$ and $x''$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ice}
ICE = |x - x''| = |x - u_{BA}(x')| = |x - u_{BA}(u_{AB}(x))|
\end{equation}

Points $x'$ and $x''$ can have an arbitrary position in space, while vector fields $u_{AB}$ and $u_{BA}$ are positioned on a grid. To apply transformation $u_{BA}(x')$ a interpolation has to be made to put $x'$ on a $u_{BA}$ grid. A tri-linear interpolation is used in this module.

As in Jacobian, ICE image is calculated and displayed, along with statistical values and ROI feature. An example is shown in Fig.~\ref{inv}.




\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./Images/inv.png}
\caption{Image of inverse consistency error (ICE) overlayed on CT scan. The average value of displayed ICE is 1.0 mm with 0.8 mm standard deviation.}
\label{inv}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


% \subsubsection{Output file}
% 
% With all different features to validate DIR it can be time consuming to go through them all. A special option was created to automatically go through all different validation steps. Furthermore it can also run through different phases, if there are more phases (i.e. in 4DCT). All produced data from DIR validation is stored on disk and can be reexamined by user upon request. Furthermore, images are created and data is summed up and displayed in a separate file. Users can then preview file for first validation of DIR and then open necessary files, if required.

% \subsection{Contour visualization}
% \label{Contour}
% 
% TRiP4D (see Section \textbf{REF}) introduced volume datasets for contour representation \cite{Richter2012}. It enabled necessary tasks for 4D calculations, such as the storing contour in different 4D states, contour propagation, etc. However, there was a lack of a proper visualization tool. In order to provide a contour visualization tool, a Slicer module was created. 
% 
% Contours are saved as volumetric boolean masks. A single bit per ROI contour representation marks each voxel inside volume dataset \cite{Richter2012}. To properly display contour, first a whole volume dataset was imported in Slicer. User selects which motion state he would like to inspect. The corresponding bit is then selected on the imported volume dataset. Lastly the contour is converted into 3D model shape. 
% 
% \subsection{Motion estimation and ITV creation}
% 
% ITV is often created by an eye investigation of all 4DCT phases, where the extent of motion is estimated. Automatic creation of ITV is scarce in commercial system, since it requires DIR on all 4DCT phases. A Slicer module was created to assist with the motion estimation and automatic ITV creation using DIR. 
% 
% Module is able to estimate and display motion of a user selected contour in three axis (left-right, anterior-posterior, superior-inferior) based on DIR vector fields. Module also performs DIR on 4DCT with patient hierarchy, if it has not been done yet.
% 
% Beside motion estimation, module can also propagate selected contour (usually CTV) and propagate it to all 4DCT and make a convolution of all propagated contours, resulting in automatically generated ITV.
% 
% \subsubsection{Generation of mid-position phase}
% 
% Most commercial software calculates treatment plan on a single 3D CT scan, using 4DCT only for motion estimation. To incorporate patient-specific motion information, a 3D CT scan was created from 4DCT in the time averaged position, also known as mid-position scan (midP scan) \cite{Wolthaus2008}. With midP scan commercial software can still be used. Additionally, it also enabled smaller error margins for PTV generation and midP scan has less noise as individual 4DCT scans, because it uses more data. 
% 
% Construction of a midP begins with registration of whole 4DCT. The resulting vector fields from reference position to 4DCT phases are then averaged to obtain mean vector field, see Fig.~\ref{midPgeneration}. Afterwards, for each vector field the mean vector field was subtracted, yielding a set of mean-corrected vector fields pointing from mean position to corresponding 4DCT phase. The mean-corrected vector fields were finally inverted and applied to each 4DCT phase, resulting in each phase being in the same, time-averaged position. In the end the set of transformed 4DCT phase was averaged to obtain midP scan.
% 
% \begin{figure}[H]
% \begin{center}
% \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./Images/midPgeneration.png}
% \caption{Computation of the midP scan. All vectors have the same starting point (reference phase, maximum exhale in the this example), therefore they can be averaged, resulting in the mean vector.
% 	Next vectors from mean position to 4DCT phases have to be computed, which is achieved by subtracting original vectors and mean vector. Figure taken from \cite{Wolthaus2008}}

\section{Verification}
\label{Verification}

Several extensions for Slicer were created to preform DIR and DIRQA. All extensions have to undergo testing to prove their functionalities. Furthermore it is necessary to verify if extensions could be used in a typical clinical work flow. Especially DIRQA, which could bring the use of DIR in everyday clinical work flow.

DIR and DIRQA were done on lung 4DCT patient data. As part of a GSI pig-irradiation project \cite{Lehmann2015} DIR and DIRQA were integrated in a simulated clinical work flow. 

\subsection{Registration of lung 4DCT patient data}
\label{lungDIR}

Chapter \textbf{REF} and \textbf{REF} present studies on simulating active scanning carbon ion treatment (CiT) for non-small cell lung cancer patients. The effects of interplay can drastically change the dose distribution for CiT and it is necessary to quantify the effects of motion with DIR and transfer results into treatment planning software (TRiP4D in our case). An automatic procedure is required to preform DIR and DIRQA on a large number of patients. This was achieved with Slicer modules described in Section~\ref{Implementation}.

\subsubsection{Materials and Methods}

A time-resolved CT (4DCT), consisting of 10 motion phases (0\% - 90\%) with approx. 1 mm pixel and 2 mm slice spacing was acquired with either Philips Brilliance BigBore 16-slice (Philips Healthcare, Eindhoven, Netherlands) or a Philips Gemini PET-CT 16-slice scanner. 23 4DCTs of lung cancer patients were used in this study.
Phase 0\% corresponds to an end-inhale phase and was chosen as a reference phase.

DIR was preformed for each patient between each phase and a reference phase and vice verse (true and inverse DIR). For each patient 18 DIRs were made, leading to 414 DIRs in total.

DIRs were done with B-Spline Plastimatch module and patient hierarchy in Slicer (see Section~\ref{RegistrationImplement} and \ref{PatHierarchy}). B-Spline DIRs were made in two stages with details given in Table~\ref{tab:stages}. 

\begin{table}[H]

		\label{exampleReg_lung}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}



Absolute difference was computed for three image pairs: reference and moving image (default absolute difference), reference and moving warped image (true absolute difference), moving and reference warped image (inverse absolute difference). In total 621 absolute differences were calculated and a down-sampling by a factor of 2 was
done on all images before calculation to save computer time. Similarly, 414 vector fields were also down-sampled by a factor of 2 before calculating Jacobian and ICE checks. Jacobian and ICE checks were calculated on all vector fields. Additionally, each vector field was analyzed for mean, standard deviation and maximum values of it's magnitudes.

ROI around patient body was manually created to get better results - area outside of patient is roughly the same in all states (air) and does not contribute to DIR. ROI was then used in absolute difference, Jacobian and ICE.

For each patient it took around 20 min for all 18 DIR and around 30 min for complete DIRQA on the same 18 DIR. An interactive Linux computer with 8 clusters and 32 GB RAM was used for DIR and DIRQA.


\subsubsection{Results}

DIR was successfully performed on all 23 patients. An example of DIR is displayed in Fig.~\ref{exampleReg_lung}. Vector fields statistical analysis is shown in Table~\ref{tab:vectordata_lung}. There was no statistical
difference between true and inverse vector fields. The biggest contribution to vector field magnitude was from superior-inferior direction (around 50\%), next was anterior-posterior direction (around 30\%) and the smallest contribution was from left-right direction (around 20\%).

\end{table}

True and inverse absolute difference dependence on default absolute difference is shown in Fig.~\ref{absDiff_lung}. It also shows default absolute difference distribution across 9 phases. 

Distribution of true and inverse Jacobian and ICE data are displayed in Fig. \ref{jacobian_data} and \ref{ice}. Dependence of maximum true Jacobian on minimum inverse Jacobian and vice verse was tested and results are display in Fig.~\ref{calcJac_lung}. Parameters from linear fit in Fig.~\ref{calcJac_lung} were used to calculate so-called scaled Jacobian for points that deviated from linear fit. Each voxel, $x$, in scaled Jacobian, $S$ was calculated from true and inverse Jacobian, $J_{True}$ and $J_{Jacobian}$, as:

\begin{equation}
S(x) = 1.7 ln(J_{True}(x)) + ln(J_{Inverse}(x))
\end{equation}

Example of scaled Jacobian is shown in Fig.~\ref{calcJac_lung}.

True and inverse maximum and minimum Jacobian and maximum ICE values were plotted against maximum vector magnitudes and fitted with linear function. Results are shown in Fig.~\ref{maxvf}.

All linear fits used in Fig.~\ref{absDiff_lung}, ~\ref{calcJac_lung} and ~\ref{maxvf} were statistically significant (p < 0.05).

\subsubsection{Discussion}

Vector field magnitudes confirm previously published data that the biggest motion for lungs is in superior-inferior direction \cite{Seppenwoolde2002, Britton2007, Liu2007}. The mean vector field magnitude is small (in submilimiter range), 
because the ROI included the whole patient body, not just the lungs where most of the motion occurs. Vectors and inverse vectors are similar, which was expected.

There was a good correlation (Pearson's r = 0.91) between absolute difference before and after DIR. The greater the difference between reference and moving image, the better DIR can lessen it. Few cases
have slightly higher absolute difference after DIR, which should not occur, since DIR was minimizing absolute difference metric. The reason lies in construction of warped images. Vector field is used to transform
moving image to warped image. If the vector field is large on the edges, an empty space will be left there in warped image. Absolute difference will therefore seem larger after DIR. A future modification of absolute difference
module should handle empty spaces at the edges.

Due to small mean vector field magnitudes, values for true and inverse Jacobian were close to 1 with small STD, which indicates that most of the patient body does not change during the 4DCT scan. This is also a direct consequence of a small vector field magnitude.
However, patient expansions and contractions can be seen on maximum and minimum Jacobian, with average values around 1.50 and 0.65 respectively. If a part of a patient body contracts from reference to moving image, 
then it expands in inverse direction and vice versa. The correlation was confirmed in Fig.~\ref{calcJac_lung}a, with a high Pearson's r (0.90). Furthermore outliers from linear fit spot inconsistencies
in DIR as shown in Fig.~\ref{calcJac_lung}b and c, where a small artifact was found in one patient phase solely from the deviation from linear fit in Fig.~\ref{calcJac_lung}. A scaled Jacobian could be used as a DIRQA check.

Mean and STD ICE are in submilimeter range, due to the correlation between vector field and ICE (see Eq.~\ref{eq:ice}). The maximum ICE values can be large, with up to 2.3 cm, 
but still smaller as average maximum vector values. 

Large vector field magnitudes will produce more errors in DIR as shown in Fig~\ref{maxvf}. Linear fit was used to estimate increase (decrease) of Jacobian and ICE. As a rough DIRQA check, ICE
should always be smaller as maximum vector field values. To confirm this, all cases above dashed line in Fig~\ref{maxvf}c were investigated and were found to have areas of poor DIR. An extreme case (highlighted in Fig.~\ref{maxvf}a-c)
had a large image artifact present in one phase (shown in Fig.~\ref{maxvf}d) leading to inconsistencies in DIR.

\subsection{Registration of pig heart 4DCT data}

Atrial fibrillation is an unorganized atrial activity, causing a quivering motion of the heart. Heart is therefore not able to sustain a healthy pumping rhythm. Atrial fibrillation is not a
deadly disease, however it worsens the patients quality of life and increases the risk of a stroke \cite{Benjamin1998}. A common method for treating atrial fibrillation is catheter ablation \cite{January2014}, 
where the success rate is still limited and can even lead to major complications or even death of a patient \cite{Cappato2005,Cappato2010}.

As an alternative treatment, a carbon-ion therapy was proposed \cite{Bert2012} and later feasibility on a beating heart was shown experimentally \cite{Lehmann2015b}. In 2014 a pilot experiment was performed at GSI using large animal model (pigs) and
scanned carbon-ion to verify the treatment in vivo \cite{Lehmann2015}.

To estimate and compensate motion of the heart during irradiation DIR of 4DCT data was required. Furthermore, because of the actual irradiation of live pigs a DIRQA had to be made, to ensure the validity of DIR. Description of the procedure will be given here,
alongside with the results.


\subsubsection{Materials and Methods}


\subsubsection{Pig irradiation experiment}

DIR and DIRQA procedures will be given here, while a detailed description of the whole pig irradiation experiment can be found elsewhere is given here \cite{Lehmann2015}. A cardiac gated contrast enhanced CT scans (4DCT-cardiac) were made on 15 pigs with a multidetector 64 row Siemens Somatom Definition Flash scanner 
(Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany) with 1 mm voxel and 1 mm slice spacing. There was no breathing motion present, since a breath-hold technique was used. Cardiac motion was divided into 10 sequential phases (0-10\%) and a field of view of 400 mm for skin-to-skin images was used.
8 pigs had a pacemaker implemented, because the irradiation was planned to disturb the heart rhythm and a pacemaker should compensate for that. Pigs are therefore divided into two groups, with pacemaker (PM) and without one (noPM).

After CT acquisition, DIR on 4DCT-cardiac was made using B-Spline Plastimatch module and patient hierarchy in Slicer (see Section~\ref{RegistrationImplement} and \ref{PatHierarchy}). Details on parameters used for DIR can be found in Table~\ref{tab:stages2}. 
Phase 0\% was chosen as a reference phase. All other phases were registered to reference phase with inverse registration as well. A checklist was made to follow DIR and DIRQA for quality assurance. An example of a used checklist is shown in Fig.~\ref{checkList}a.

Based on lung patient DIR and because of the time pressure, DIRQA was made only on DIR from one phase, phase 50\%. DIRQA consisted of true absolute difference\footnote{Relative difference between moving and warped image absolute difference was displayed in DIRQA file rather than just absolute values.} 
, true Jacobian and ICE. DIRQA results were stored in a text file (example shown in Fig.~\ref{checkList}b) and users checked if the values did not exceed expected ones: Absolute difference
mean should be smaller than 1; Jacobian mean should be 1 with not too high extreme values; ICE mean should be smaller than 2 mm with not too high extreme values. ROI was manually created to encompass pig body and then used in all DIRQA checks.

After successful DIR and DIRQA vector fields were used in treatment planning and the resulting plans were used in pig irradiation experiment.

For each pig it took around 20 min for all 18 DIR and additional 30 min for DIRQA on 18 DIR. An interactive Linux computer with 8 clusters and 32 GB RAM was used for DIR and DIRQA.

\subsubsection{Post-experiment analysis}

After pig irradiation experiment, a more detailed DIRQA was made, with all phases included in DIRQA. In addition to original checks explained in previous section, absolute difference checks were made on inverse warped image, 
inverse Jacobian and vector magnitudes were analyzed.

\subsubsection{Results}


All DIRs were successful and during experiment all DIRQA checks were positive. An example of DIR is shown in Fig.~\ref{exampleReg_pigs}. Statistical analysis on vector field magnitudes is shown in Table~\ref{tab:vectordata_pig}. No statistical difference was
observed between true and inverse vector fields. However, significant difference was observed between vector field magnitudes of PM and noPM. Contributions to vector field magnitudes from three axis were equal.

Dependence of true and inverse absolute difference on default absolute difference with a linear fit is shown in Fig.~\ref{absDiff_pigs}. Default absolute difference distribution across 9 phases can be seen in inset in Fig.~\ref{absDiff_pigs}.

Distribution of Jacobian and ICE results are shown in Fig. \ref{jacobian_data_pigs} and \ref{ice_pigs}. Maximum true (inverse) Jacobian was plotted against minimum inverse (true) Jacobian and results were fitted with a linear function, see Fig~\ref{calcJac_pigs}. Maximum values of true and inverse Jacobian and maximum ICE were tested against maximum vector magnitudes and fitted with linear function. Results are plotted in Fig.~\ref{maxvf_pigs}.

All linear fits in Fig.~\ref{absDiff_pigs}, ~\ref{calcJac_pigs} and ~\ref{maxvf_pigs} were statistically significant (p < 0.05).

\subsubsection{Discussion}

Mean vector field magnitudes were small (approx. 0.1 mm), since pigs were in a breath-hold position and the only motion was the beating of the heart. 
Despite the small mean vector magnitude it was still enough to observe statistical difference between the PM and noPM.
Consequently, the difference between the two groups is consistent throughout the DIRQA.

The DIR did well in terms of lowering the absolute difference metric. There was a strong correlation between default versus true and inverse absolute difference. The shape of default absolute difference
distribution persist then in other DIRQA check as well.

A good result in absolute difference does not necessary mean a good DIR, as can be seen from Jacobian and ICE checks. The mean Jacobian and ICE were 1 and 0, respectively, since the
vector fields were small on average. However there were large deviations present in Jacobian and ICE. Most notably, there were a few cases of negative minimum Jacobian which would suggest 
organ folding. Since organ folding did not occur during a heart beat, negative minimum Jacobian points to inconsistencies in DIR. The inconsistencies in DIR can be also seen on Fig~\ref{calcJac_pigs},
with a poor correlation between minimum inverse and maximum true Jacobian. The correlation is better for noPM, however there are still cases that deviate from linear fit.

The large deviations in Jacobian and ICE can in part be explained with large maximum vector field values, as shown in Fig.~\ref{maxvf_pigs}. All linear fits have good correlation, with no
difference between PM and noPM in the quality of the fits. The actual linear fit parameters, however, further show the inconsistencies in DIR. The clearest example of inconsistencies in
DIR is with linear fit from maximum ICE PM, which lies above $y(x)=x$ function. This basically means that there were points further away from starting point after true and inverse transformation, 
then just after true transformation. The linear fit for noPM maximum ICE showed better results in this terms, since it lied below $y(x)=x$ function.

It was also displayed that DIRQA should be made on all DIR not just on one phase, since DIRQA from one DIR does not guaranty the quality of the other DIR from 4DCT. Each DIR is performed individually and should be treated as such. However, deviations in DIR from single 4DCT could be used to
spot inconsistencies.

\section{Summary and Discussion}
\label{Summary}

Tools to preform DIR and DIRQA were presented in this chapter. Different modules were written for an open-source software Slicer, that can handle large DIR problems, such as registering whole 4DCT. In addition to DIR the modules can also make DIRQA on the same set as DIR was made with several different
checks. The main objective of this work was to provide systematic approach to DIR and to give parameters on DIRQA that can estimate the quality of DIR. A first analysis of DIRQA checks was done on a large DIR database - 684 DIR were checked in total.

Most of the work was based on Slicer, which is well-established software in medical research. To date, there are more than 500 publications that have used Slicer in their research \cite{SlicerCitation}, with topic ranging from 
teaching \cite{Pujol2016}, disease staging \cite{Liu2016, Liu2015}, motion tracking \cite{Behringer2015} to image reconstruction \cite{Meyer2015}, image registration \cite{Li2015, Fedorov2015, Li2015b}
and others. Slicer offers a lot of different functionalities and is especially good for research, since it can be modified to specific needs. However, it is important to stress that Slicer 
is not a medical application and can be used only for research. Additionally, Slicer can sometimes be unstable with unexpected crashes. It is constantly under development and more and more errors
are fix with each new release. New releases also bring new functionalities, but there can be problems with backtrack compatibility Even though there are some disadvantages to using Slicer, it's advantages
definetelly outweigh them and make Slicer a useful tool, as was showed in this chapter.

Results shown in this chapter were obtained with DIR made by B-Spline algorithm. Several other algorithms exist, demons most commonly used alongside B-Spline \cite{Thirion1998}. Varadhan et al. made comparison
between B-Spline and demons DIR for lung case \cite{Varadhan2013} and showed that B-Spline is superior to demons, especially if there is difference in contrast between images. They used mutual information
metric, to account for differences in contrast. Images used in this chapter were either all without (lung case) or all with (pig case) contrast agent, therefore there was no difference in contrast
between images. Mutual information metric was tested as well for DIR, however the results were much worse than mean square error metric.

The evaluation of DIR was made by DIRQA module. The main advantage of the DIRQA module is that all different techniques are gathered in a single place and can be used on a specific case. The ease of use is also essential, for DIRQA to find it's way into clinical work flow
A test of using DIRQA in potential clinical work flow was done at GSI during pig experiment, where different users had to use both DIR and DIRQA modules. The experiment was also under time pressure, since there is
a scheduled beam time and it cannot be shifted. There were already prepositions for frameworks for DIRQA in clinical work flow \cite{Varadhan2013}, however none were tested in an actual clinical environment

The techniques used in DIRQA can be divided into visible (inverse color, checkerboard) and quantitative (absolute difference, Jacobian and ICE). While the quantitative can be used to pinpoint errors in DIR, the visible can be used to actually see the error and how does it affect the
end result, as shown in Fig.~\ref{calcJac_lung}c. All three quantitative checks have been used in literature as a possible DIRQA \cite{Varadhan2013, Leow2007, Christensen2001, Bender2009}. They all share the same flaw, however, that they are a necessary condition for a successful
DIR but not sufficient. One common DIRQA check in literature that our module is currently missing, is comparison of anatomical correspondence - 
comparison between reference, moving and warped contours. Ideally warped and reference contour should be the same. Two metrics are usually used in contour comparison -
dice similarity coefficient \cite{Varadhan2013} and Hausdorff distance \cite{Huttenlocher1993}. Slicer already has functionalities for both contour comparison checks, so they could be used. 
The biggest disadvantage of anatomical correspondence check is that contour delineation is required in both, reference and moving phase, which is scarcely done by physicians, 
since it takes too much time. Lack of contour in both, reference and moving phase, was also the reason the anatomical correspondence check was not used.

Studies on DIRQA so far have focused on a small number of DIR cases, weather it is phantom \cite{Mutic2001,Moore2004} or patient studies \cite{Wu2008, Varadhan2013}. With small number of DIRs
it is possible to thoroughly examine each DIR and hence now what to excpect from the DIRQA. In this chapter a different approach was
used. Rather than examining each DIR individually, a large dataset was analyzed and common traits for DIR were found. Due to differences in anatomical sites, 
DIRQA parameters have to be found for each anatomical site individually, since they can
deviate significantly, as seen by two different cases presented here. However there may be parameters that persist throughout different anatomical sites, scaled Jacobian in particular.

DIR of lung 4DCT can be considered relatively easy, since the changes between phases are small and the contrast between lungs and other tissue is high. 
This is supported by Fig.~\ref{calcJac_lung} and \ref{maxvf}. The correlation between expansion of tissue in reference phase should directly correlate to tissue contraction in moving phase. 
Even though Fig.~\ref{calcJac_lung}a shows only plot between maximum and minimum Jacobian in two phases, the correlation is still apparent (Pearson's r = 0.9). With calculation
of difference between maximum and minimum Jacobian in each individual voxel, it is possible to pinpoint the position of DIR inconsistencies, as shown in Fig.~\ref{calcJac_lung}. A small
artifact was found in one phase and it was responsible for deviation from linear fit. Deviation from linear fit in Fig.~\ref{maxvf}a-c, was also used to spot DIR inconsistencies
and a lung image artifact was found in a different patient.

If the DIR of lung 4DCT was considered relatively easy, opposite holds true for DIR of 4DCT-cardiac. The motion of the heart during a heartbeat is complex, 
with muscles stretching \cite{Seeley2007} and contracting in different directions. Furthermore,
the volume of blood shifts from one ventricle to the other. In the case of 4DCT-cardiac blood carried a contrast agent, therefore different phases in 4DCT-cardiac 
had different distribution of HU in different parts of the heart. Additionally, it was well established that pacemakers cause several complications in a CT scan \cite{Mak2012}. This was
confirmed by the differences observed between PM and noPM. Clearest example is the PM linear fit of maximum ICE in Fig.~ \ref{maxvf_pigs}, which is above $y(x) = x$ curve. 
The complexity of DIR is further seen in the negative values of Jacobian, which should not occur. The DIR of 4DCT-cardiac is currently under careful investigation
and several different solutions, such as artifact removal and different registration order are being tested.

In the future DIRQA module should undergo further testing. In addition to checking DIRQA on different anatomical sites and between different modalities, 
it should be investigated how good is DIRQA at spotting inconsistencies in DIR, i.e. what is the number of false negatives. Furthermore, with more
data analyzed, the parameters in DIRQA checks should get more precise, so outliers could be easier spotted.
